Rapid increase in the cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows a similar trend in the European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
According to Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care services need to prepare for a peak in patients with COVID-19 requiring care, and in particular intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a case outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Prevention and Control designated the responsible agent as a new coronavirus now known as Coronavirus 2 of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
To date, approximately 80% of people with COVID-19 have a benign condition, i.e., a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, most of which heals.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 leads to a more severe illness requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% develop a severe form of the disease requiring intensive care.
Mortality of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we evaluate the evolution of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each of the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK), and compare it with the evolution of the province of Hubei, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK with that of Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following that of this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 constitutes a pandemic.
In the March 5 edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
Within the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of March 15, 2020, COVID-19 cases had been detected in each of the 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK) with, between December 31, 2019 and that date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported, including 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths for Italy alone.
Cumulative Number and Cumulative Incidence of COVID-19 Cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases reported in each country around the world, obtained only from official sources such as ministries of health, national and regional health authorities of different countries as well as WHO, is updated daily at 08:00.
These data were used to assess the evolution of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK, and to draw a comparison with Italy's experience.
In order to assess the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative 14-day incidence of COVID-19 cases, thus taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19, within each EU/EEA country and in the UK, for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compared the cumulative number of cases reported in each country as of March 15, 2020 at 8:00 a.m. with data from Italy for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
Evolution of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The evolution of the cumulative 14-day incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK has generally followed that of the province of Hubei (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February before experiencing a drastic increase around 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom showed a similar increase in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional data).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to data from Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
As of 8 a.m. on 15 March, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to Italy only 3 weeks or less earlier.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is rapidly increasing within the EU/EEA and the UK.
The evolution of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic is progressing at a comparable rate in all countries.
And this despite the fact that countries are at different stages and there are differences in responses from national public health services, potential variations in case definitions as well as differences in patient selection protocols to be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, including for catch-up tests.
In early March 2020, doctors in affected regions of Italy reported that about 10% of patients with COVID-19 require intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care services in these regions have already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admission of COVID-19 cases to hospitals and/or intensive care are currently available across the EU/EEA for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not shown).
It is, however, necessary to conduct systematic collection in order to supplement current surveillance data that focus on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed a significant gap in the number of beds available in intermediate and intensive care services in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 individuals in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive and intermediate care per 100,000 individuals in 2010-11).
Modeling scenarios for saturation of care capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA and UK country of the prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 cases associated with a 90% risk of overcapacity in intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of the CEPCM Rapid Risk Assessment on COVID.
Given that cases have hitherto been clustered in some regions of the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive care services generally accommodate a defined regional population, data on cases and beds in intensive care should preferably be established at level 2 of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS 2).
Italy's experience and current developments in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly within the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care services must therefore prepare for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 as well as an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring care, especially intensive care, as in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted by CEPCM's recent rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, moving from a containment approach to a mitigation approach, since the rapid and early increase in the number of cases may not leave sufficient time for decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window during which each country can strengthen its control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on health services.
Otherwise, it is likely that health systems in other EU/EEA countries will face a spike in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease epidemic (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus 2, has so far resulted in more than 3,000 deaths and infected more than 80,000 people in China and around the world, causing a humanitarian catastrophe.
Like its counterpart, SARS-CoV, which resulted in thousands of SARS cases in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by bats and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissive, affecting older people more than young people and men more than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on this emerging disease, this article strives to provide a timely and comprehensive review of this burgeoning research topic.
We will address the fundamentals of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions are still waiting for answers, we hope that this review will help to better understand and eradicate this serious disease.
The Spring Festival, January 25, 2020, has forever marked the Chinese, who have been forced to remain cloistered for the duration of the Golden Week as well as for many more weeks due to the spread of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; that is why it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the associated disease coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan and quickly spread to all of China before spreading to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients hospitalized and more than 3,000 deaths.
According to WHO, COVID-19 is “public enemy number one,” potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 studies have been published on COVID-19, including in the areas of virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on January 7, 2020 presenting the sequence of the virus, isolated from several.
This review attempts to synthesize the progress of research on this new and growing topic.
As soon as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronavirus disease, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, an epidemic that took place in 2012).
We will also take stock of what we have learned so far in terms of disease prevention and prognosis, and address some outstanding but urgent issues.
Coronaviruses are traditionally considered non-fatal pathogens for humans, mainly causing about 15% of common colds.
However, during this century, we experienced two highly pathogenic coronaviruses for humans, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an epidemic that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, before spreading rapidly to many other countries with high morbidity and mortality.
COVID-19 is the third most recent coronavirus outbreak in recent history.
As shown in Fig.1, outbreaks of pneumonia of unknown origin were first reported in Wuhan on December 31, 2019, with the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was unveiled.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case was reported in Wuhan.
In the meantime, the epidemic had quickly spread to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, it was reported that health professionals had been infected, suggesting that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was placed under quarantine with interruption of all its public transport.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease indicated that out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients had been in direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, considered the starting point of the infection with an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) called the epidemic a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease had already spread to all of China as well as nearly 50 other countries around the world (Fig. (Fig. 2).
As the situation changes rapidly, the final extent and severity of the epidemic remains to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multicenter study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19, presented an updated overview of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qqq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mostly in the 30-65 age group.
Nearly half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 years of age, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 developed in homes, mainly in Hubei Province and on the outskirts.
The average duration between onset of symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 was 5 days (2-9).
The mean incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The mean duration between onset of symptoms and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The baseline reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected had increased exponentially until January 23, 2020, coinciding with the massive displacements that took place before the Spring Festival in China.
Mortality of patients identified as confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (male), age (> 60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large enveloped viruses containing a single stranded RNA.
They can be classified into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, the coronaviruses known to infect humans belonging to the alpha and beta genera.
The Spike glycoprotein (S) of the envelope binds to the angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2) and to the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) of its cellular receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then a membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA accompanied by envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins forms vesicles containing virions, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was presented on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be a new type of betacoronavirus, with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequential samples taken from the source site of the epidemic, the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
Using transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultrafine sections of human epithelium of the airways.
Human ACE2 has been identified as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to human ACE2 less strongly than that of SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less significant infection than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b as well as a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 could play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit expression of IFN; however, the orf8 does not contain known domains or functional motifs.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al. presented the cryo-ME structure of the complete human ACE2 at a resolution of 2.9 in complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins, which provides indications for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The original host and the intermediate host
It was found that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV came from bats and were transmitted to humans via civets and camelids, respectively.
Following a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, bats were advanced as the native host of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to the two SARS-type coronaviruses from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that allowed the virus to cross the species barrier to infect humans remains unknown, and the route of transmission is yet to be elucidated.
Ji, et al. hypothesized that the virus could have been transmitted from bats to humans by snakes, which would imply homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to a study conducted by researchers in Guangzhou, China, the pangolin - a long-sleeved mammal feeding on ants, often used in traditional Chinese medicine - could be the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 if judged by the 99% genetic homology made between a coronavirus discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% discrepancy between two genomes is a difference of importance, so conclusive results should be expected to establish concrete evidence (Fig. 33).
The physico-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very little known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature of 20 °C and a humidity of 40 to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may very well have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and at a temperature of 56°C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-based disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.
The human population as a whole is generally immune to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
At present, no detailed studies have been reported regarding the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to studies previously conducted on other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig. 4).
In general, when a virus infects a host, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system through molecular pattern recognition (PRR) receptors, in particular lectin type C receptors, Toll type receptors (TLRs), NOD type receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I type receptors (RLRs).
By different routes, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV N protein may allow the virus to escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, and in particular CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells that produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly remove infected cells.
Help T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines in order to support the defense cells.
However, coronavirus can inhibit the functions of T cells by inducing their apoptosis.
Humorous immunity, with supplements such as C3a and C5a as well as antibodies, is also essential to fight viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a restored patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system causes a localized explosion in the number of free radicals, which can lead to serious damage to the lungs as well as to other organs and, in the worst case scenario, multi-visceral failure, even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by an onset in homes, is more likely to affect elderly people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is commonly accepted that people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised are more at risk of being infected than others.
The average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 1-14 days, but more generally 3-7 days based on a study of the first 425 cases reported in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days on average, for a range of 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, concluded an incubation period of 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) based on a demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is very important that the health authorities adjust the effective duration of the quarantine period according to the most accurate incubation period possible, in order to prevent infected but asymptomatic persons from transmitting the virus.
Generally, people exposed to, or infected with, the virus are quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the first and main symptom of COVID-19, and may or may not be accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced dyspnoea and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients quickly developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms as well as those with acute fever, even in the absence of chest X-ray abnormalities, should be tested for the virus to allow early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 showed that patients had 98% fever, 76% dry cough, 55% dyspnoea and 3% diarrhea; 8% of patients required ventilatory assistance.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent family and outbreak studies following transmission of the virus from an asymptomatic individual.
Similarly, a demographic study conducted in 2012 showed that the main symptoms of MERS-CoV patients were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnoea (55%).
However, 80% required ventilatory assistance, far more than COVID-19 patients, consistent with higher MERS lethality compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
Regarding SARS, the main symptoms were fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnoea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20%-25%) and sore throat (13%-25%), and ventilatory assistance was needed for approximately 14-20% of patients.
As of February 14, COVID-19 mortality was 2%, for 66,576 confirmed cases worldwide.
In comparison, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% per 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, mortality was 37% for 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only 2-4.
A comparison of symptoms, mortality and R0 of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV is presented in Table1.1.
The above data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater ability to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak than it was for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV outbreaks.
The appearance of a fire often occurs within a family or in a gathering or vehicle, as in the case of a cruise.
Patients have often traveled or resided in Wuhan or other affected areas, or have been in contact with infected people or patients in the two weeks prior to the onset of symptoms.
However, it has been shown that individuals may be carriers of the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients who have been restored may be carriers of the virus again, underscoring the need to increase the duration of quarantine.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (including lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, lymphopenia with a white blood cell count < 4 x 109/L and a lymphocyte count < 1 x 109/L, as well as a high level of aspartate aminotransferase and viraemia were identified in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
Some patients had elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood, and most had elevated levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation.
In the most severe cases, the level of D-dimer, a degradation product of fibrin present in the blood, was high, and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
Chest X-ray abnormalities are observed in most patients with COVID-19, characterized by bilateral uneven shadows or frosted glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In the case of ARDS, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis severely compromise gas exchanges.
The dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes leads to a decrease in the level of surfactant and an increase in surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to swell and increasing the risk of pulmonary collapse.
Therefore, the most troubling chest exams often coincide with the most severe form of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed a scaling of pneumocytes, the formation of hyaline membranes, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration and the presence of multinuclear syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who has died from the disease, which coincides with the pathology of viral infection of RASMS and ARDS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via a polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription (RT-PCR) was used as the primary criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which was no longer based solely on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation was observed for the diagnosis of SARS.
Thus, the combination of medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological examinations is essential and imperative to establish an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for using the SHERLOCK technique based on CRISPR technology for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, which makes it possible to identify synthetic RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2 between 20 and 10-18 mol/L and 200 and 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of sample aid)
It is to be hoped that this new technique will significantly improve sensitivity and practicality if its use on clinical specimens proves conclusive.
Because of the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, physicians can only offer supportive care to patients with COVID-19, while trying a variety of therapies that have already been used or proposed for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include existing and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, restored patient plasma, Chinese medicine as well as psychological support.
Even plasma from recovered patients has been proposed for treatment purposes.
Pharmaceutical companies are all working to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first and probably also, to a lesser extent, other organs expressing ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
Nevertheless, respiratory dysfunction and insufficiency are the main threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Thus, respiratory assistance is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives; this includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OMEC), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat critical heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shocks, as well as the protection of vital organ functions are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
Excessive immune response has been shown to cause cytokine shock in SARS and MERS patients.
A cytokine shock is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a whole series of cytokines, in particular TNF', IL-1', IL-2, IL-6, IFN', IFN', IFN', IFN' and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of ARDS and multi-visceral failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine shocks, especially in severe cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine shocks.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine shocks include modulation of the immune response by T cells, blockade of IFN-?, IL-1 and TNF cytokines, inhibition of JAK, blinatumomab, cytokine 4 signaling suppressor, and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressive agents, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
However, taking high-dose steroids had no beneficial effects on severe lung lesions in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, they would result in serious side effects, including avascular osteonecrosis, thereby significantly affecting the prognosis.
However, careful use of short cycles of low- to moderate-dose corticosteroids has been recommended for patients with severe forms of COVID-19.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleoside analogue, has been shown to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
Based on these findings, Gilead transmitted the compound to China to allow a number of trials on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-?, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been advanced as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side effects may occur following combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicines used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Restored patient plasma and antibody production
Collecting blood from patients who have cured a contagious disease to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from the disease is an ancestral practice.
Indeed, restored patients often have a relatively high rate of antibodies against the pathogen.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B cells to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies; they recognize molecules unique to pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients who had cured COVID-19 and injected 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, in association with a decrease in the phenomenon of inflammation, a reduction in viral load and an increase in oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are needed to be able to propose this method for large-scale use as long as no specific treatment has been developed.
Moreover, given the therapeutic effects, certain drawbacks associated with plasma should be carefully examined.
For example, antibodies can lead to excessive stimulation of the immune response and cause a potentially fatal cytokine release syndrome.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma to treat seriously ill patients is high.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more essential and effective to isolate B cells from restored patients and to identify the genetic codes encoding the relevant antibodies or to look for effective antibodies against the main proteins of the virus.
This would rapidly increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used for thousands of years in China to treat a wide variety of diseases.
However, its effects rely largely on the combination of multiple components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis, posed according to the theories of the TCM.
Most of the effective components remain little or no known since it is difficult to extract and verify them, or to know their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific effective treatment for COVID-19, TCM is one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or remission of a severe form of the disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have proven effective for treating COVID-19.
The best cure rates for COVID-19 were observed in 87% of their patients in China, including Gansu Province (63.7%), Ningxia Region (50%) and Hunan (50%), while the province of Hubei, which used only 30% of patients with COVID-19, has the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is a rather approximate comparison since many other impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, need to be considered for evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing a treatment using Western medicine only and a combination treatment combining MO and TCM.
It was found that the time to return to normal body temperature, the time to disappearance of symptoms, and the length of hospitalization were significantly shorter for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone.
Even more impressive, the rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (7.4% versus 46.2%); likewise, mortality was lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (8.8% versus 39%).
Nevertheless, the efficacy and safety of the TCM remains to be specified through controlled trials conducted on a larger scale and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations, if possible.
Individuals identified as probable or confirmed cases of COVID-19 generally feel a strong concern about this highly contagious and deadly disease, and those placed in quarantine also experience a sense of boredom, loneliness, and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatments, such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia, can lead to increased anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early days of the SARS epidemic, multiple psychiatric morbidities were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, psychotic symptoms, an acute confusional state, and even suicidal tendencies.
Mandatory contact research and quarantine, as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase anxiety and lead to some guilt from the effects of contagion, quarantine, and stigmatization of family and friends.
Thus, mental health care needs to be provided to patients with COVID-19, individuals identified as likely cases, people in contact with these populations, as well as any other individual in distress.
This psychological support should include the formation of multidisciplinary teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, as well as the use of professional electronic applications and equipment to avoid close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to disrupt the chain of transmission of infected animal reservoirs and humans to vulnerable hosts, and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in controlling outbreaks caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein-based vaccines, with a view to producing potent long-term neutralizing antibodies and/or inducing protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live attenuated vaccines were evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these potential vaccines in elderly and lethally challenged models and their protection against zoonotic virus infection remains to be determined, as no clinical studies have yet been initiated.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS went extinct 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, sporadic cases and outbreaks of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Various vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-related particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and critical goal in controlling the ongoing epidemic.
However, this is a real challenge due to the significant delay (18 months on average) required to develop a vaccine and the dynamic variations of coronaviruses.
To the extent that it is an emerging disease, COVID-19 is just beginning its clinical evolution through thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patients gradually recover without sequelae.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality for the most serious cases.
Therefore, establishing a prognostic model is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies conducted so far, the factors that may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 are as follows (Table (Table 33):
Age: Age was the main factor for SARS prognosis, and this also appears to be the case for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects individuals between the ages of 30 and 65, with 47.7% over the age of 50, according to a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older (median age 66 versus 51 years), suggesting age as a prognostic factor for patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart damage and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to the positive cholangiocytes of ACE2, which can lead to liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and the presence of underlying health problems are strongly correlated and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the blood reflect the severity of tissue inflammation or damage; it has been advanced as a potential prognostic factor of disease, response to treatment, and healing.
The correlation between CRP and severity and the prognosis of COVID-19 was also proposed.
In addition, high levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also contribute to the prognosis.
These enzymes are widely expressed in several organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released in case of tissue damage.
They are therefore traditionally markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Major Clinical Symptoms: Chest X-ray results and time progression of clinical symptoms should be examined in combination with other elements for the determination of prognosis and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used in supportive treatment for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
Because high-dose corticosteroids have been widely used for severe cases of SARS, many survivors have experienced avascular osteonecrosis resulting in permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Thus, if necessary, the administration of steroids to patients with COVID-19 should be limited to a low dose and a short duration.
Mental stress: As described above, the COVID-19 epidemic has resulted in a large number of cases of exceptional stress, with patients often experiencing long periods of quarantine, extreme uncertainty, and the death of relatives or other patients.
It is imperative to offer long-term psychological support and support to help these individuals overcome this stress and return to a normal life.
Based on demographic studies conducted to date, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 also replicates effectively in the upper respiratory tract and does not cause symptoms in the first phase of infection, such as coronaviruses causing common colds.
As a result, newly infected or incubated individuals can produce a large amount of virus during their daily activities, significantly hampering the control of the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV was considered to be transmitted by severely ill patients, with a very low probability of transmission in the first phase.
The current COVID-19 outbreak is therefore much more serious and difficult to control than SARS.
Considerable efforts are currently being made in China, including the containment of Wuhan and neighboring cities, as well as the continued quarantine of almost the entire population to disrupt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
While these measures have had a dramatic impact on the economy as well as other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates suggest that the epidemic will end in March and that the degrowth phase will last from 3 to 4 months.
However, not all experts share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, et al., believe that COVID-19, which appears to be significantly more infectious than SARS, will not be extinguished in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., developed a model to predict the outcome of the outbreak and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 had been detected in samples from the middle nasal horn and throat of recovered patients, 2 weeks after they were discharged from the hospital, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclical episode like the flu.
However, encouraging signs were seen in China with the gradual decline of new cases, suggesting that the strategies implemented would have worked.
Initially, the Ebola virus was expected to cause up to one million cases and half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was eventually brought under control.
It is possible, as with SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 weakens in terms of infectivity and eventually goes extinct or evolves into a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS is provided below (Fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible by coughing or sneezing, and also possibly by direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus has also been identified in stools, revealing a new possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 patients found that 41% of cases were possibly due to nosocomial infections, with 17 patients with previous illnesses and 40 health professionals.
Precautionary measures should therefore be taken to protect individuals, including health professionals, social workers, relatives and colleagues of patients, and even anyone likely to be in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first possible line of defense to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of face masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 breathing masks (1860) is involved in controlling the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent potentially infected droplets from being sprayed or deposited on surfaces, where they could be passed on to others.
However, only N95 (1860) masks provide 10 to 80 nm virion inhalation protection, with only 5% of virions able to fully penetrate; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV, since both measure about 85 nm.
Since the particles manage to pass through five surgical masks stacked on top of each other, it is imperative that health professionals in direct contact with patients wear N95 masks (1860s) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health professionals should wear tight-fitting insulation jackets to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect an individual by the eye.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor turned out to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have penetrated his body by eye due to inflammation.
Therefore, health professionals should also wear transparent visors or protective glasses in contact with patients.
For populations in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, remain confined to the maximum, and limit contact with potentially infected people.
It is advisable to maintain a distance of one meter with the patients.
These measures are effective ways of reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for humans, its high degree of homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, must have placed China on high alert after the SARS epidemic in 2003.
However, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention reassured the population that the new virus was not contagious, that it had limited interhuman communicability, and that it would not be difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message has resulted in a notable release, especially as the entire country is preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical opportunity to contain the disease in Wuhan has been missed.
Chinese disease control agencies need to learn from this and take appropriate action.
For example, these agencies must (1) be more cautious in their public announcements, because each word counts and can affect the population's behavior and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual clinical data rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or official bodies; (3) be more restrictive in order to contain a potential epidemic in its early stages rather than improve it.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of writing this report, it expanded to all of China as well as nearly 50 other countries around the world.
Since this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 are also close to those of SARS, the COVID-19 epidemic is born as an impression of déjà vu.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which must be taken into account in order to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and more men than women; severity and mortality rates are higher among older people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Transmission of the COVID-19 virus is possible even in the absence of symptoms, while SARS was mostly transmitted by seriously ill patients; it is therefore much more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and much more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be negative for some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, restored patients can be positive for the virus again.
This greatly increases the risk of spreading.
Despite rapid progress in COVID-19 research, several critical issues remain outstanding, including:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homology has been established between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-type coronaviruses from bats, this is not sufficient to conclude with certainty that SARS-CoV-2 originates from chiropractors.
What is the intermediate species that allowed the transmission of the virus from the original host, for example bats, to humans?
Without answers to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to effectively stop transmission, and the epidemic can resume at any time.
Molecular modeling and biochemical analyses have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how exactly does the virus penetrate respiratory cells and cause pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells expressing ACE2 from other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible to define a quick and accurate diagnosis or effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during human-to-human transmission?
Will it evolve into a global pandemic, disappear like SARS or resurface regularly like the flu?
It is essential, although it may take time, to get answers to all of these questions as well as many others.
However, no matter how much it costs, we have no choice but to end this epidemic as quickly as possible in order to resume the normal course of our lives.
Generally, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by about 2 weeks of illness.
Only a few immunocompromised patients have experienced severe lower respiratory tract infection.
The first case of SARS dates back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
Apart from the supertransmitters, it was estimated that each case could cause approximately two secondary cases with an incubation period between 4 and 7 days, with the peak viral load occurring on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experience myalgia, headaches, fever, discomfort and chills, followed by dyspnoea, cough and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, distorted liver function tests and elevated creatine kinase are common abnormalities observed in laboratory analyses in case of suspected SARS.
Diffuse alveolar lesions, epithelial cell proliferation and increased macrophages are also observed in SARS patients.
Approximately 20-30% of patients then require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney can also be infected in these severe cases, often accompanied by cytokine shock, which can be fatal especially in immunocompromised patients.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was prevalent in young children, the elderly and immunosuppressed patients with respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from the nose sample of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is actually present worldwide.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called croup.
That same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized due to pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is present globally, causing moderate respiratory diseases.
Generally, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to transmit effectively and sustain themselves continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
Clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to SARS and are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also developed acute renal failure, which is characteristic of MERS compared to HCoV pathologies.
More than 30% of patients experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported with a high death rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the deadliest viruses known in humans.
Diarrhoea is also observed in some patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and could contribute to its rapid spread around the world.
The comparison and contrast of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs revealed some very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and duration of HCoV diseases are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the four community-based HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 are also observed as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and long-lasting spread after transmission to humans, will influence the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
The four community-based HCoVs causing moderate symptoms have adapted well to humans.
In other words, both could be survivors of previous HCoV pandemics.
For this to happen, HCoVs must replicate in humans in a sufficient proportion to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations that compensate for host restriction factors.
With this in mind, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic persists and the larger the number of people infected, the more likely the virus is to fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, its transmission between men will be difficult to stop by a quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four community-acquired CoVs have been circulating within the population, triggering a simple cold in immunocompetent subjects.
These viruses do not require an animal reservoir.
In contrast, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are highly pathogenic, have not adapted well to humans and their transmission between men is not sustainable.
They must maintain and propagate in their zoonotic reservoirs and look for an opportunity to reach potential human targets, probably via one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoV and less pathogenic than SARS-Cov or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to human beings and circulate among the latter without animal host reservoir or intermediate.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it will be helpful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifying hosts of HCoVs.
An animal serves as the evolutionary host of an HCoV if it harbors a close ascendant sharing a high homology to the nucleotide sequence.
The original virus has often adapted well and is non-pathogenic to its host.
In the same way, a reservoir host houses the HCoV on a continuous and long-term basis.
On the other hand, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
In particular, given that 80% of the animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that several species of small mammals may also serve as intermediate hosts amplifiers cannot be excluded.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These studies laid the foundation for a new concept that bats are the hosts of emerging human pathogens.
The human angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2) is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
Despite high homology between these two viruses, it is generally estimated that WIV1 is not the immediate relative of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
This is why bats cannot be the intermediate reservoir host of the MERS-CoV.
In addition, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are HIV-positive to specific antibodies that neutralize MERS-CoV, as well as camels from the Middle East that are present in several African countries.
In addition, infected camels excrete the virus not only via the respiratory tract, but also via feces, which is also the main route of excretion of bats.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even less than that separating the beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 from pangolin.
Recombination is a widespread factor in the evolution of beta-CoV.
Scientists remain divided on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could be derived from bat CoV, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 parent viruses have been found in rodents.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically associated with another bat CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, while camelids were also suspected to be intermediate hosts.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed the species barrier to infect humans from domestic cattle around 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was reported.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Alpha-CoVs of the bat near HCoV-229E have been found.
First, unlike alpaca, men can have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
On the other hand, humans have close contact with alpaca.
Second, the bat alpha-CoVs related to HCoV-229E are numerous and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca alpha-CoV has caused an epidemic of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV was not found in wild animals.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including the rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Another possibility is that while the bat's alpha-CoVs serve as genetic reservoirs for HCoV-229E, alpaca and dromedaries could serve as intermediate hosts that transmit the viruses to humans, just like in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of inter-species transmission from bats to dromedaries and from dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV found in bats is known from its initial identification and has also been reinforced by later discoveries.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in dromedaries for decades.
It has been well adapted in these camels that have gone from intermediate host to stable natural reservoir hosts.
Contrary to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if they have one, is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
Several possibilities of interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans have been included or excluded from future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share an ecological niche with bats via chipping or coal mines.
Second, pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifying hosts to which a SARS-CoV-2-linked virus has recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus by cutting and eating game meat.
Many mammals, including pets, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred within a third species having been in contact with both bats and pangolins.
Research on the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of the CoVs could be considered “moderate” to “high” with an average substitution rate of 10-4 substitutions per year per site, depending on the phase of adaptation of the CoV to new hosts.
Nevertheless, the mutation rates of CoVs are about a million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the rate of mutation is often high when the CoVs have not adapted well to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher rate of adaptation in humans.
It can be assumed that he has already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which has been well adapted to dromedaries.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to render vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective in the short term.
Third, CoVs change patterns randomly and frequently during RNA replication through a unique "choice-copy" mechanism.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found for both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as for animal-observed CoVs, such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction related to transmission
Beyond these three viral factors indicated above, viral interaction with a host receptor is another key factor influencing interspecies transmission.
SARS-CoV recombination is taken as a typical example here; it also shows evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission episodes.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions can be key factors in adapting the virus to humans.
It is interesting to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein means that the binding affinity of this S protein with human ACE2 may have been altered.
Indeed, a study by electron cryomicroscopy indicates a 10- to 20-fold greater affinity of this bond compared to that observed between human ACE2 and the SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-receptor may be required for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Oddly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with a different part of the S protein.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as N-aminopeptidase for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
Divergence of host proteins between humans and natural HCoV reservoir hosts, such as bats, camels and rodents, could be a barrier to inter-species transmission.
Emergence of new HCoV: back to the starting box
The diversity of bat CoVs offers many opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs are genetic reserves of HCoVs.
Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 was considered important in human adaptation, as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated but coded for divergent ORF8 proteins.
This deletion splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host change.
Recombination sites have also been identified in nsp9, most nsp10, and some nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic has experienced episodes of recombination between different lines, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
While ORF4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpaca alpha-CoV has a simple insertion of nucleotide, causing a lag in the reading frame.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoVs is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with VOCs, indicating mutual adaptation between VOCs and bats.
It seemed that bats had adapted well to VOCs from anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by VOCs.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (DRO) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress replication of CoV and affect "re-reading" by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and give rise to highly pathogenic viral strains when a new host is introduced into them.
More pathogenic strains of VOCs could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics intended for host adaptation.
Thus, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared over the past two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate solidly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets of the observation of asymptomatic carriers and what causes cases of severe infection in humans reside.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung lesions.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decoupled from CoV replication.
The same strategy of dissociation of the immune response could have beneficial effects in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is defective in bats.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
While a bat beta-CoV sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a bat CoV sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Remarkably similar pangolin beta-CoVs to SARS-CoV-2 have been found, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoV could contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
CoVs have returned to the limelight due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in the dromedary for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the locals.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as has been done in China’s wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurring outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines in camels, along with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
In particular, bat CoVs, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
Cultivation of wildlife consumption in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contacts between humans and animals.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until an opportunity for contagion presents itself.
Ongoing monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of VOCs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing transmission from animal to human and future outbreaks.
To conclude, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the ecological niches of natural zoonose reservoirs.
First, if bats transmit a parental SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins might share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it would be necessary to determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal plays the role of a true intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Whether it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or near-identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts should be identified.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as the flu or cold, for example, by failing to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals, which can be harmful or cause disease.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; and reducing respiratory infections.
as well as the reduction of infant mortality rate during home births.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates from respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as handwashing with soap.
Pneumonia, one of the leading IRAs, is the leading cause of death in children under five years of age, which kills nearly 1.8 million per year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia cause the deaths of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Minor deleterious effect, frequent hand washing can damage the skin by causing skin dryness.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to eczema or dermatitis in the hands, characterized by scaly skin and itching, and particularly common among health care workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
Deworming twice a year, combined with daily hand washing with soap and daily toothbrushing with fluoridated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce obstacles to the solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleanser for the skin since lipids and proteins, which are organic soil matter, are hardly soluble in water.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, can contain bacteria from previous uses.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants makes it possible to target antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not the result of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as advertised.
In addition to the surface-active and protective agent of the skin, the most complex formulas containing can contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate the pH, benzoic acid, having an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, extracts of plants).
The hot water used to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water in removing natural oils that carry dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have revealed that the use of warm water does not help to reduce the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or antiseptic is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
Most are formulated based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol combined with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a gel, or with a moisturizer such as glycerin in order to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of the alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide enhances antimicrobial activity.Hand sanitizers containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydroalcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and ERV), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Water-alcoholic solutions are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of hand sanitizer or water-alcoholic solution should be used to properly wet or cover both hands.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and rapid removal of microorganisms; however, they should not replace adequate hand washing unless you have soap and water on hand.
The frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions can cause skin dryness if the formula is not reinforced by skin emollients and/or moisturizing agents.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, water-alcohol solutions containing emollients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in hydroalcoholic solutions are rare.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not remove organic matter on the hands, but only disinfect them.
It is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, since these remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers depends heavily on the ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based sanitizers.
More recently, formulas that use benzalkonium chloride have exhibited long-lasting and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy subsides after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Ash or earth can be more effective than water alone, but less than soap.
Moreover, if soil or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease instead of stopping it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Running water is recommended because of the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while the water temperature does not seem to make a difference).
Make a generous amount of soap foam on your hands by rubbing them against each other, not forgetting the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies reveal that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
The action of rubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and rubbing longer removes more germs.
Rinse thoroughly with running water.
Rinsing in a stagnant pool of water can lead to hand recontamination.
Dry with a clean towel or in the open air.
Wet and moist hands are more easily recontaminated.The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, the spaces between the fingers and the underside of the nails.
Artificial nails and peeled nail polish can house microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; dry skin promotes the appearance of skin lesions that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to washing hands when tap water and/or soap are not available. For example, pouring water from a suspended and drilled can or bottle and/or using ash if necessary, in developing countries. In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas).
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a hanging crucible using a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a soap loaf.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry your hands in the public toilet is debated.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers that are often found in the toilet.
After washing and drying hands in the hot air hand dryer, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased by an average of 194% on the pulp of the fingers and 254% on the palms.
Air jet hand drying resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the pulp of the fingers by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After hand drying, the following variations in bacterial count were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying using paper towels.
Hand washing with disinfectant wipes is an alternative solution during travel, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
There are electronic devices that issue reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
Medical hand washing should last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to foam and rub each part of the hands.
Hands should be rubbed against each other as they pass between the fingers.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the faucet (and open the exit door if necessary).
The goal of hand washing in health facilities is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (“germs”) and prevent their transmission.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
after exposure to blood/biological fluid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
All jewelry must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash your hands and forearms to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
When rinsing, water on the forearms should not flow to the hands.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
Regarding the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained during the first 20% of washing, and that there were very few additional benefits of increasing the frequency of hand washing by more than 35%.
Further research is needed to find out what are the most effective interventions in different health structures.
For example, in much of rural Africa, it is rare to find hand-washing taps near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options for building hand-washing stations.
However, low handwashing rates can also be attributable to tenacious habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Once the minimum standards are met, schools can switch from one to the final three stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be part of the hand hygiene promotion campaigns that are conducted to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness campaign that purports to foster changing behaviours.Following the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating handwashing.
However, one review suggests that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to foul odors called miasmas.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating “good hand washing techniques” were placed next to sinks in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The term "washing one's hands" refers to a person's refusal to take responsibility or to be an accomplice in something.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having these kinds of thoughts are less likely to engage in other “purification” compensatory measures, such as volunteering.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing their hands before and after each meal.

It should also be noted that artificial selection may contribute to involuntary changes in the genomes of viruses, which are most likely due to the pressures exerted during selection, in particular by the host's immune system.
Examples include the loss of the complete ORF4 in the prototype strain HCoV-229E, due to a deletion of two nucleotides.
While ORF4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpaca alpha-CoV has a simple insertion of nucleotide, causing a lag in the reading frame.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoVs is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with VOCs, indicating mutual adaptation between VOCs and bats.
It seemed that bats had adapted well to VOCs from anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by VOCs.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed by the positive regulation of the receptor inhibiting the natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and by the low rate of expression of the molecules of the major class I histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (DRO) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress replication of CoV and affect "re-reading" by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and give rise to highly pathogenic viral strains when a new host is introduced into them.
More pathogenic strains of VOCs could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics intended for host adaptation.
Thus, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared over the past two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate solidly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets of the observation of asymptomatic carriers and what causes cases of severe infection in humans reside.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung lesions.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decoupled from CoV replication.
The same strategy of dissociation of the immune response could have beneficial effects in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
The response to interferon is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is defective in bats.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 appeared following the general pattern by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While a bat beta-CoV sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a bat CoV sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While commercially available civets and other animals were found to carry viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 were identified.
Remarkably similar pangolin beta-CoVs to SARS-CoV-2 have been found, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoV could contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence to suggest that SARS-CoV-2 was man-made, either intentionally or accidentally.
CoVs have returned to the limelight due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of VOCs in bats and other animals has significantly altered our perception of the role of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs in the transmission of HCoVs to humans.
Numerous factual data have shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate from bats and are transmitted to humans by intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection is caused by contact between humans and civets in markets, closing markets for fresh produce and slaughtering the civets there could have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
Based on the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from fresh product markets to prevent zoonose transmission, given the discovery of numerous beta-CoV lines of pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals and, if so, how this transmission occurs will remain to be determined in the studies that follow.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in the dromedary for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the locals.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as has been done in China’s wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurring outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines in camels, along with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
In particular, bat CoVs, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
There is no shortage of opportunities for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and recombine, causing the emergence of new, more transmissible and/or deadly CoVs in humans in the future.
Cultivation of wildlife consumption in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contacts between humans and animals.
In the face of the devastation caused by SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be put in place.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until an opportunity for contagion presents itself.
Although bats have many characteristics favorable to the spread of viruses, the likelihood for humans to be in contact with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized if people are sensitized to the need to stay away.
Ongoing monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of VOCs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing transmission from animal to human and future outbreaks.
To conclude, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the ecological niches of natural zoonose reservoirs.
Not yet all the secrets of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are known.
First, if bats transmit a parental SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins might share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it would be necessary to determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal plays the role of a true intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to contracting SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental contamination should be carried out.
Whether it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or near-identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts should be identified.
Future research in this area will help elucidate the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and will have significant implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Updating the diagnostic criteria for “suspicious cases” and “confirmed cases” of COVID-19 is required
On February 6, 2020, our team published a Quick Recommendation Directive for the Diagnosis and Treatment of the New Coronavirus Infection 2019 (2019-nCoV) and this directive described our experience and provided references to combat this pandemic globally.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is recent, our knowledge and knowledge is gradually progressing based on the results of ongoing studies and clinical practice experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment regarding our guidelines and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for a “suspicious case” and a “confirmed case” according to the latest COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment guidelines (seventh version) published by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an epidemic that now officially bears the name coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO called COVID-19 a pandemic.
To be able to fight SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick recommendation that was published online on Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It has attracted a lot of attention since its publication.
However, please note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our knowledge and knowledge progresses slowly based on the results of ongoing studies and clinical practice experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment guidelines issued by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) had a total of seven editions between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, some of which have been substantially modified.
Since our directive received feedback from Zhou et al., they submitted a simple evaluation proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work has provided new evidence for our directive and is also a valuable reference for this global pandemic.
We approve of their important work and thank them.
However, their work must also be updated according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (seventh version trial) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), confirmation of a suspected case must associate one of the features of the epidemiological history with two elements of clinical manifestations to constitute a complete analysis, or must correspond to three elements of clinical manifestations in the absence of a clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence symptoms in the city of Wuhan and in neighbouring areas such as anecdotal areas or in other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test of anecdotal acids);
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging with the characteristics of a COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count indicating normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte counts from the onset of symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on the suspected case with any of the following pathological or serological evidence: (1) positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequencing of the entire viral genome exhibiting strong homogeneity with known novel coronaviruses; (3) positive serologic test for IgM antibody and IgG-CI of SARS
We can see that the real-time PCR test of nucleic acids in the airways or in blood samples was added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and in the third edition (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic screening of blood samples was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and the fifth edition (8 February 2020); then serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes build on the researchers’ ongoing work to find an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as airway samples including blood sampling, with increased availability of different specimens, and have contributed to the addition of the specific antibody positive result in the confirmed criteria.
In addition, more and more evidence reminds us to be cautious with regard to atypical symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the graphical representation of Zhou et al. should be updated as they classified people with no clinical symptoms as "low risk."
The evaluation system should also be verified in clinical practice and in future studies.
In conclusion, we hope for the emergence of more direct evidence and ask readers to submit their comments.
Regarding the diagnosis of “suspicious cases” and “confirmed cases”, we suggest that they follow and comply with the most recent guidelines in their country.
Our team will also update our directive in a timely manner to offer its assistance.
Bangladesh Announces Five New COVID-19-Related Deaths, a Daily Record
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19-related deaths in a single day.
The country records a record mortality from the virus in a single day.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Surveillance and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of contaminated people registered included 114 active cases and 33 people cured, who remained confined at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
The closure of public transport began on 26 March and was due to end on Saturday 4 April.
Transport of essential goods (medical supplies, fuel and food) was still permitted.
By March 19, these three people had already recovered.
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Around the world, countries have announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the city's confinement until May 1.
The Parliament of Portugal voted to extend the national state of emergency by 15 days; the vote was adopted with 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one vote against.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
Epidemics of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have reversed the trend to reveal how devastating and potentially deadly an HCoV infection could be.
Most HCoVs come from bats in which they are not pathogenic.
The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
Studying CoV-host interactions in animals could also allow for better understanding of CoV in humans.
Depending on the differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV). The beta-CoV genus contains the majority of HCoVs and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents play the role of genetic source for the majority of alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of HCoV provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving forces and restrictive factors of crossing the species barrier.
It can also guide or facilitate the search for the SARS-CoV-2 reservoir(s), intermediate and amplifier host(s), with important implications in the prevention of future infections.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated in the airways of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and then adapted to grow in WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had symptoms of the classic cold, including headache, sneezing, discomfort and sore throat, with fever and cough observed in 10-20% of cases.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are both present all over the world and seem to be transmitted mainly in winter, in temperate countries.
Stores in Australia reduce limit quantities of toilet paper per purchase
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian retail chains Woolworths and Coles reduced their restrictions on buying toilet paper to two and one package per purchase in all stores nationwide, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a one-package limit.
These limits were posted in the form of messages to the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the channels.
Buyers apparently amassed reserves for fear of COVID-19 and the need to confine themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted purchases of toilet paper for home deliveries to one package per order.
These measures followed the previous restriction of four packages per purchase introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in his March 8 press release, said that with the four-package restriction in place, “many stores are still out of stock within an hour of delivery,” and called the request “unprecedented,” while ALDI, in a Tuesday Facebook post, called it “unexpected.”
Sales rose “strongly” last week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
The Costco store in Canberra also reduced the allowed quantity to two packages last week.
In order to further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered an additional stock, while ALDI made stock available earlier for a promotion scheduled for Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase inventories, but local council restrictions on truck delivery schedules make the task difficult.
It forecasts higher production costs, while suppliers are trying to meet demand, and fewer promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early release of stocks, some stores are not able to honor Wednesday’s promotion.
In an article published on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a distribution industry expert at Queensland University of Technology, explained that stores replenish inventories every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a bulky item, resulting in small stocks that, when depleted, leave large spaces empty in shelves, reinforcing the impression of a shortage.
“Coles and Woolworths consider [that] if the shelves are full, if products such as toilet rolls and disinfectants can be [buyed] and are available in large quantities, it will likely reduce panic,” Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper maker Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday they were out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who makes Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, who makes Sorbent paper, said they are working 24/7 to maintain supply, according to the News.com.au article.
Domain.com, a real estate site, said some real estate sellers offered free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, while fewer auctions were held because buyers were on leave during the long weekend of Labor Day.
Thursday’s edition of NT News, a Darwin-based print newspaper, included an eight-page insert intended to be cut and used as toilet paper.
The stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a March 3 report by ABC Australia in which they announced that they were not planning to introduce purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products were also in high demand, including masks, disinfectants, dry products, hand hygiene products and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed on Sunday evening that the British online supermarket Ocado was limiting purchases of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization calls COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) called the current outbreak of COVID-19 (the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus) a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to the degree of spread of the disease, and not to the dangerousness of specific cases, WHO indicated the need to push governments to action:
“Every country can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries track, test, treat, isolate, locate and mobilize their populations as part of the response,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
“We are deeply concerned, not only by the alarming levels of propagation and severity, but also by the alarming levels of inaction.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “unprecedented.”
He said in remarks released by CNN in February that “apart from the flu, no other respiratory viruses have been observed since its onset until its continued spread globally.”
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, stating that “we have never witnessed a pandemic caused by a coronavirus.”
He added: “And we have never witnessed a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time.”
The new pandemic status follows the WHO’s decision in January to declare the epidemic an international public health emergency.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the epidemic: “to put it short, the situation will get worse.”
On Thursday, the Associated Press announced that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing coronavirus disease epidemic since 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute coronavirus 2 respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared a public health emergency of international scope on 30 January 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people are healed.
The rate of lethality is estimated at 4% in China, while in the rest of the world it varies from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth to cough, staying away from other people, as well as monitoring and confining people suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by putting travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk controls and facility closures in place.
The pandemic has caused serious global socio-economic disruption, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages exacerbated by panic purchases.
Schools and universities have closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 percent of the global student population.
False information about the virus has circulated on the Internet, and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred against Chinese, other people of East and Southeast Asian origin and appearance, as well as other people from regions with many cases of the virus.
Due to decreased travel and closures in heavy industry, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported an outbreak of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause on December 31, 2019, and an investigation was opened in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were related to Huanan's seafood wholesale market, so the virus is thought to be zoonotic in origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is called SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely linked to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. Subsequently, the first known person with symptoms was found to have become ill on December 1, 2019, and that person had no apparent link to the subsequent market location of the strawberry.
Of the cases of the first outbreak reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to have a link to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that the first case could date back to November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old person from Hubei Province. On February 26, 2020, the WHO reported that, as new cases appeared to be decreasing in China but suddenly increasing in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside of China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be a strong underestimation of cases, especially among those with mild symptoms.
On 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, those aged 19 and under representing 2.4% of cases worldwide. The Chief Scientific Adviser of the United Kingdom, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the British population needed to be infected before effective collective immunity could be achieved.
Cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries had official policies not to test those who had only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, as of January 23, there were an estimated 86% of undetected COVID-19 infections, and that these unrecorded infections were the source of infection in 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the reported cases.
The first estimates of the baseline reproduction rate (R0) of COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 are cured.
For those who do not heal, the time between the onset of symptoms and death is between 6 and 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80 percent of deaths were among those over 60, and 75 percent were suffering from pre-existing health conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official counts of deaths related to the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to deceased people who were tested positive for COVID according to official protocols.
The number of actual COVID-19 victims could be much higher, as it might not include untested deceased people – e.g., at home, in retirement homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy reveal that the numbers of over-mortality during the pandemic are 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death count.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has acknowledged “We know [the number of deaths reported] is underappreciated,” a statement confirmed by anecdotal reports of underappreciation in the U.S. Such an underappreciation often occurs during pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic. The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on the 9 January 2009.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
On 28 February, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths per country were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
On 13 March, more than 40 countries and territories reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica, and several indicators are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time elapsed since the beginning of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and especially health. The case-death ratio represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given period.
According to statistics from Johns-Hopkins University, the global case-death ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, case-death ratio estimates decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms occurring between 1 and 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms occurring after 1 February 2020). The other indicators are the rate of lethality (lethality rate), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed with a disease who succumb to it, and the rate of infection (the rate of non-infection).
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of the contamination at the end of the disease.
Several scientists have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates that the overall infection rate for the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest value of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analyzing the impact of the tests on estimates of the rate of lethality.
The WHO says the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may vary by region.
Maciej Boni of Pennsylvania State University said: “Without control, infectious epidemics usually stabilize and then begin to regress when the disease comes to lack of available hosts.
But it’s almost impossible to make relevant predictions right now about when that will happen.”
Chinese government chief medical adviser Zhong Nanshan said “it could be over by June” if all countries succeed in mobilizing to follow WHO recommendations on measures to halt the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 “will continue to circulate, potentially for a year or two.”
According to an Imperial College study conducted by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be needed “until a vaccine is available (possibly within 18 months or more).”
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: "I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus -- because it's very easily transmitted -- would completely disappear" and that it "could turn into a seasonal disease, likely to reappear every year."
The virulence of this return would depend on the collective immunity and the extent of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are sometimes quite non-specific and infected people can be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretions (mucus), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headaches, chills, vomiting, hemopsis, diarrhea, or cyanosis. WHO says about one in six people is seriously ill and has breathing difficulties.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identifies emergency symptoms such as respiratory distress, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficult waking, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms are present.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, without any clinical symptoms but with test results confirming the infection, so the researchers issued recommendations that people who had close contact with confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and examined to rule out the risk of infection.
Chinese assessments of the asymptomatic ratio range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between contamination and onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is more often than not five days. Good example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost the smell was initially 30% before falling to 15%.
Some information on how the disease spreads remains to be determined.
The disease is supposed to be transmitted mainly during close contact and by fine droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or speaking; this close contact corresponds to a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that unprotected coughing can project droplets from a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some suggested that the virus could also be transmitted by thin droplets that would remain in the air for longer periods of time, which could be projected while speaking. Respiratory droplets can also be projected upon exhalation, including by talking, although the virus is not usually airborne.
Postillons can land in the mouth or nose of other people next door or even be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause respiratory secretions that are sprayed and thus lead to airborne spread.
It can also spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
If some fear that it can be transmitted through the stool, this risk is considered to be low.
The government of China has ruled out the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious for the first three days after the onset of symptoms, however spread may be possible before symptoms appear and at advanced stages of the disease.
People were tested positive for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms suggesting that transmission is possible before the development of significant symptoms.
Only a few laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic case reports exist, but asymptomatic transmission has been detected by some countries during contact research investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that if it is not yet known exactly how easily the disease spreads, one person usually contaminates two to three others.
Precisely, the virus could be detected after three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, after one day on cardboard, and after four hours on copper.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature, and pets and other animals have been tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however British authorities recommend washing hands after touching animals, such as after being in contact with other surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia linked to the focus of cases of Wuhan acute respiratory disease.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in coronaviruses related in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the initial SARS-CoV.
It is thought to be of zoonotic origin.
A genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus belongs genetically to the genus Betacoronavirus, the subgenus Sarbecovirus (B lineage) associated with two strains from bats.
It is 96% identical to the whole genome of another bat coronavirus sample (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid difference in parts of the genome sequences between pangolins and human viruses.
Comparing the entire genome to date has revealed a maximum of 92% common genetic material between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed based on symptoms, however the final confirmation is made by reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of the infected secretions or scan.
A study comparing PCR and scanner in Wuhan suggested that the scanner is significantly more sensitive than PCR, though less accurate, as many of its imaging features coincide with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that “the scanner not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19.”
The WHO published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with a first release on January 17.
The test uses reverse transcription of the chain reaction by real-time polymerase (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed on respiratory or blood samples.
The results are usually available in a few hours or days.
Generally this test is carried out on a rhinopharynx sample but a throat sample can also be used. Several laboratories and companies are currently developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
On April 6, 2020, none of them proved reliable enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
Characteristic imaging elements on X-rays and CT scans of people with symptoms include asymmetric frosted glass peripheral opacities and a lack of pleural effusion.
The Italian Society of Radiology is currently an international online database of confirmed case imaging results.
Due to cross-linking with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without PCR confirmation is of limited accuracy to detect COVID-19.
A major study in China compared the results of chest scans to PCR and showed that while imaging is less accurate for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, advocating its use as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based convolutional neural networks have been developed to detect features of the virus in imaging on both X-rays and scans.
Strategies for preventing disease transmission include having overall good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching one’s eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing in a handkerchief and then throwing the handkerchief directly into a garbage bag.
Those already infected were advised to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures were also recommended to prevent transmission. Many Governments have banned or discouraged all non-essential travel to or from countries and sectors affected by the epidemic.
Nevertheless, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in large areas of the planet.
This means that the virus is spreading in communities, and some members of these communities do not know where or how they have been contaminated. Health professionals who care for someone who may be infected are advised to take the usual precautions as well as contact precautions, and to wear protective glasses. The search for contacts is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of future infection and prevent them.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments in this regard has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement calling for limits to such surveillance.
Various mobile apps were launched or offered on a voluntary basis, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user’s presence near other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has been tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions are currently circulating about how to prevent infection; for example, rinsing your nose and gargle with mouthwash is not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, but many organizations are currently working to develop one.
It is advisable to wash your hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after being in the bathroom or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after molting, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks its protective envelope.
The CDC also recommended the use of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not easily accessible.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated in several ways (in one minute of exposure to the disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2-7.5% iodized povidone.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in a facility such as an office building or nursery, all rooms such as offices, toilets, common rooms, as well as common electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls, and vending machines used by the sick, be disinfected.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouth and nose with their folded elbow or handkerchief when they cough or sneeze, and to throw away any handkerchief immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who would be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance traveled by projected postillons by talking, sneezing, and coughing.
The WHO has issued instructions explaining where and when to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “Wearing a mask can reduce people’s propensity to touch their faces, which is an important source of infection in the absence of proper hand hygiene.”
WHO has recommended wearing masks to healthy people only if they are at significant risk, for example if they are caring for a patient with COVID-19, even though it recognizes that wearing the mask can help people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have begun encouraging their people to wear masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing non-medical fabric masks. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks for healthy people, especially in cases of proximity (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask in public transport or crowded places.
In Thailand, health authorities are encouraging people to make face masks at home and clean them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned public outings without a mask or other means of covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam imposed the wearing of the mask on everyone in public places, so that everyone protects themselves and others.
The Austrian government has ordered anyone entering a supermarket to wear a mask.
Israel has asked all its residents to wear a mask in public.
Taiwan, which has produced 10 million masks per day since mid-March, imposed the wearing of the mask on passengers on trains and long-distance buses on April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a mask for any trip, while recommending the manufacture of a handmade mask to those who cannot buy it.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also called physical distancing) includes infection control measures designed to slow the spread of the disease by decreasing contacts between people.
Methods include quarantines, travel restrictions, and closing schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, and shopping malls.
One can apply methods of social distancing by staying at home, limiting one’s travels, avoiding crowds, greeting one another without contact, and keeping a physical distance from others.
Many governments now order or recommend social distancing in areas affected by the epidemic.
The maximum scale of rallies recommended by U.S. government and health agencies was rapidly reduced from 250 people (if there is no known presence of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned the public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults pre distance to social contact and those with underlying health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension or a weakened immune system are at increased risk of serious illness and complications. They were thus invited by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in areas affected by the epidemic.
The use of the term "social distancing" suggested the need for total social isolation, rather than encouraging people to maintain contact with others through other means. Some authorities have issued guidelines on sexual health during the pandemic.
They include the recommendation to only have sex with a person with whom you live, who does not have the virus or its symptoms.
Home isolation has been recommended for those diagnosed positive for COVID-19 and those who think they are infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper isolation, and many governments have imposed or recommended individual quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The strictest individual quarantine instructions were given to people in the most at-risk groups.
Individuals who have been exposed to a patient with COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region where transmission is very important were asked to quarantine for 14 days from the time they were last exposed.
Strategies to control an epidemic are containment or suppression, and mitigation.
The containment is implemented in the early stages of the epidemic and aims to monitor and isolate infected people, as well as to introduce other infection control and vaccination measures to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts are being made to mitigate the spread of the disease and to mitigate its effects on the health care system and society.
Containment and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures to curb the pandemic by reducing the number of baseline reproduction to less than 1. Part of managing an infectious disease epidemic is trying to mitigate the epidemic peak: this is called flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overloading health services and saves time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the epidemic include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, the wearing of masks and strict individual quarantine; public measures of social distancing such as the closure of schools and religious services; a public effort to encourage the acceptance of such interventions and participation in them; as well as environmental actions such as the cleaning of surfaces have become more drastic during the recent period.
Other countries have also adopted a variety of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass screening and localized quarantine, and issued alerts on the movement of infected people.
Singapore has provided financial support to those infected who have been quarantined, and imposed heavy fines on those who have not.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and sanctioned the seizure of medical supplies. Simulations for Britain and the United States show that mitigation (deceleration but not elimination of the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (reverse the development of the epidemic) face significant challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce health care demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but cannot prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths, and health care systems are overwhelmed.
Suppression may be preferred, but should be continued as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if it happens first), because otherwise, transmission bounces back quickly when measures are released.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has a social and economic cost.
There are no approved antiviral treatments for COVID-19, but developmental efforts are underway, including testing for existing treatments.
Taking over-the-counter cold medications or drinking drinks as well as rest can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory assistance may be required.
The use of steroids can aggravate the results.
Several compounds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied for the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO said that some “traditional and artisanal remedies” can soften the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increased capacity and adaptation of health care to the needs of patients with COVID-19 is described by WHO as a fundamental response measure to the epidemic.
ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have released guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to redeploy resources at various levels, including by devoting laboratory services to COVID-19 testing, cancelling non-urgent interventions where possible, and separating and isolating patients with COV-positive capabilities.
There are various theories concerning the place of origin of the very first case (called patient zero).
The first known case of the new coronavirus could date back to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
They are usually linked to Huanan's seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals. According to one theory, the virus would come from one of these animals; in other words, it would have a zoonotic origin. An outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause was observed on December 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at the hospital of Hubei Province, which informed him of Jihan C.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of a “SARS-like coronavirus.”
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for giving the alert.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice on December 31 and informed WHO.
There were enough cases of unknown pneumonia reported to Wuhan health authorities to trigger an investigation in early January, and in the early stages of the epidemic, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, aided by Chinese New Year migrations and the fact that Wuhan is a transport hub as well as a major rail link.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Subsequent official data shows that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms on January 20, 2020. On March 26, the United States surpassed China and Italy by posting the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. On April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died and more than 364,000 healed.
Approximately 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many Schengen countries have restricted travel and put in place border controls.
National responses have included containment measures such as quarantine (also called homestay orders, on-site shelter or confinement) and curfews. As of April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, are subjected to some form of containment in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa.
By March 26, 1.7 billion people in the world experienced some form of confinement, a figure that amounted to 2.6 billion two days later – about a third of the world’s population.
The origin of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was dated December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggests that the very first case would date back to November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed an outbreak of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause on December 26, of which she informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
Initial genetic testing of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
A public opinion was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31.
The WHO was informed the same day.
Doctors in Wuhan received a warning for “spreading rumors” about the outbreak.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there was no “clear evidence” of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping as a “people’s war” to curb the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as “the largest quarantine in human history,” a cordon was announced on January 23 to stop travel to and from Wuhan, which has been extended to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles was banned in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (25 January) have been cancelled in many places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was later built: Leishenshan, to treat additional patients.
In addition to the new hospitals, China has converted 14 other structures in Wuhan, such as convention centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government instituted new measures to curb the COVID-19 epidemic, including issuing health declarations for travelers and extending Spring Holiday holidays.
The country’s universities and schools have also been closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macau have instituted several measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Remote working measures have been instituted in several Chinese regions.
Travel restrictions have been adopted in Hubei and beyond.
Public transport has been modified and museums in China have been temporarily closed.
Population movement control has been applied in many cities, and it has been estimated that about 760 million people (more than half the population) have dealt with some form of movement restriction. After the epidemic entered the global phase in March, Chinese authorities have taken strict measures to prevent the virus from being "imported" from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day quarantine for all international travelers entering the city. As of March 23, in mainland China, only one case had been transmitted inside the country in the previous five days, in this case via a traveler returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Prime Minister Li Keqiang said that the spread of cases transmitted inside the country was essentially blocked, and that the epidemic was controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were relaxed in Hubei, apart from Wuhan, two months after the start of the containment.The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on March 26, 2020 that entry for holders of a visa or residence permit would be suspended from March 28, without specifying when this policy would end.
People wishing to enter China must apply for a visa at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen on March 30, and granted monetary stimulus plans to businesses. The State Affairs Council announced a day of mourning to begin with three minutes of silence on April 4 at 10:00 a.m., coinciding with the Qingming holiday, although the central government has asked families to pay tribute online to respect the physical distancing' COID-19 outbreak.
It has been confirmed that COVID-19 spread to South Korea on January 20, 2020 from China.
The nation’s health agency reported a considerable increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely attributed to a gathering in Daegu of a new religious movement called the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
Shincheonji worshippers who visited Daegu from Wuhan were suspected of having been behind the epidemic.
On 22 February, among the 9,336 faithful of the church, 1,261 or about 13% reported symptoms. South Korea announced the highest level of alert on 23 February 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, followed by 3,150 on 29 February.
All military bases in South Korea were quarantined after three soldiers tested positive for the virus.
The schedules of the airlines were also reached and therefore changed. South Korea introduced what was considered the largest and best organized program in the world to test the population for the virus, and isolate all infected persons as well as track and quarantine those who have been in contact with them.
Screening methods included mandatory individual symptom reporting by international newcomers via a mobile app, virus screening drives delivering the results the next day, and an increased testing capability to allow nearly 20,000 people to be tested each day.
South Korea's program is considered a success in controlling the epidemic, although it has not quarantined entire cities. South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon’s impeachment of the government’s mismanagement of the epidemic or on the contrary praising his reaction.
On March 23, South Korea experienced the lowest number of cases per day in four weeks.

Despite this, the U.S. took time to start testing, which obscured the true extent of the epidemic at that time.
Testing was hampered by defective test kits produced by the federal government in February, lack of federal approval for non-government test kits (universities, businesses and hospitals) until the end of February, and restrictive criteria for being eligible for a test until early March (compulsory doctor’s order later).
On February 27, The Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.

Ma also donated medical equipment to Canada, with the Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic expressing concerns about masks and screening kits made in China.
For example, Spain removed 58,000 coronavirus screening kits made in China with an accuracy rate of only 30%, while the Netherlands recalled 600,000 defective Chinese protective masks.
Belgium recalled 100,000 unusable masks; they were thought to come from China, but they were actually from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese aid was well received in the Latin American and African regions, and on 2 April the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
The WHO praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities in managing and curbing the epidemic.
WHO noted the contrast between the 2002-2004 SARS epidemic, where Chinese authorities had been accused of concealment that hampered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis where the central government “provided regular reports to avoid panic on the eve of the Lunar New Year.”
On January 23, in response to the decision of the central authorities to enforce a travel ban in Wuhan, the WHO representative Gauden Galea stated that the 2009 outbreak of disease in China was a public health issue (although it was “certainly not a recommendation of the WHO”, it was nevertheless a “very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic where it is most concentrated” and he spoke of an unprecedented fact in the following.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said USPPI was due to “the risk of global spread, especially for low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the application of travel restrictions, Tedros said, “there is no reason for measures to unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade” and “WHO does not recommend restricting trade and travel.”
On 5 February, WHO called on the international community to contribute $675 million to fund strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the urgent need to support those countries that “do not have the necessary systems to detect people who contracted the virus, even if it was about to appear.”
Tedros then said we were “as strong as our weakest link” and urged the international community to “invest today or pay more tomorrow.” On 11 February, WHO established in a press conference that the disease was named COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros said that UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to integrate “the strength of the entire UN system into the response.”
A UN crisis management team has been activated to coordinate the entire UN response, which the WHO says will allow them to “focus on the health response while other agencies will be able to bring their expertise to manage the broader social, economic and development implications of the epidemic.”
On 14 February, a WHO-led joint mission team was activated in China to send international and WHO-led experts on-site to support national management and assess "the severity and transmission of the disease" by organizing workshops and meetings with major national institutions and conducting field visits to assess "the impact of response activities at the provincial and rural levels".
In response to the development of the epidemic in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team to assess the situation.On 28 February, WHO representatives said that the global coronavirus threat assessment had gone from “high” to “very high”, its highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergency Management Program, said: “This is a return to reality for every government on the planet: wake up.
This virus may be on the way and you need to stand by,” adding that the right response measures could help the world avoid “the worst.”
Ryan then said that the current data did not allow public health officials to announce a global pandemic, stating that such a statement would mean that “we absolutely accept that every human on the planet is exposed to this virus.”
On March 11, WHO said the coronavirus outbreak could be called a pandemic.
The Director-General stated that WHO is "extremely concerned about both the alarming levels of spread and severity and the alarming levels of inaction." WHO has faced significant criticism of its management of the pandemic, which is deemed inadequate, particularly due to the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
This negative reaction was supported by a petition urging WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom to postpone his resignation, signed by 733,000 people as of April 6.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts focused on respecting the rights of every individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group indicated that everyone has the right to receive relief interventions and that this responsibility rests with the government.
The group insisted that lack of resources or health insurance should never serve as a justification for any discrimination against a specific group.
The experts stressed that each individual has the right to health, including persons with disabilities, minority, elderly, internally displaced, homeless, those living in extreme poverty, detainees, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International government organizations are responsible for the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has launched a platform that provides timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in different countries of the world, as well as views and advice.
Between policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy and responses to the effects of containment and travel restrictions, the digital platform includes a Country Policy Tracker tool to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, British cabinet minister Michael Gove and the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for managing the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several provincial administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) have been removed from office following their quarantine management in central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the response of policymakers to the epidemic in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping from popular anger over the coronavirus epidemic.
Some senior Chinese officials, e.g. Zhao Lijian, rejected the first idea that the coronavirus outbreak had begun in Wuhan in favor of conspiracy theories that COVID-19 would have its origins in the United States or Italy.
The U.S. administration of Donald Trump called the coronavirus a “Chinese virus” or “Wuhan virus,” saying that in China “censorship has overfed a virus that has now become a global pandemic,” which was later labeled racism by some opponents and intended to “divert attention from its administration’s inability to contain the disease.”
The Daily Beast obtained a telegram from the U.S. government outlining a communication ploy apparently coming from the National Security Council, whose strategy is as follows: “It all comes from China.
We are being asked to try to communicate this message in every possible way, including at press conferences and television appearances.” News outlets such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg claimed that China’s efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus were part of a propaganda push to gain global influence.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there was "a geopolitical component involving a struggle for influence through rhetoric and "generosity policy".
Borrell also said that “China aggressively insists that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner.”
China has also called on the United States to lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while sending a priori aid to the latter two countries.
The 100,000 masks donated by Jack Ma to Cuba were blocked by U.S. sanctions on April 3.
U.S. authorities have also been accused of diverting aid to other nations to their own countries.
And other mask-related conflicts have also been reported between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, as well as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has seized hundreds of respirators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the European Union's lack of solidarity with Italy, which has been affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italy’s ambassador to the EU, said: “Only China has responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign of European solidarity.”
On March 22, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian military to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous “high-ranking political source” who said 80 percent of Russian aid was “little if not useful for Italy.”
The source accused Russia of embarking on an offensive of “geopolitical and diplomatic” charm.
Lombardy President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio denied the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia has also sent a cargo plane carrying medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that “by offering his help to his American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and equipment have gained speed, they will be able to give them back if necessary.”
The scale of NATO’s planned “Defender 2020” military exercise in Germany, Poland and the Baltics, NATO’s largest maneuver since the end of the Cold War, will be reduced.
Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: “In the current public health crisis, it is endangering not only the lives of American troops and many participating European countries, but also that of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate.” The Iranian government has been heavily affected by the virus, with about twenty members of parliament infected, as well as fifteen other current politicians.
Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for help on March 14, 2020, saying his country was struggling to fight the epidemic due to lack of access to international markets due to U.S. sanctions on Iran. The epidemic has prompted calls for the U.S. to adopt more universal health care policies, including a global health care system.
Political analysts expect this to negatively affect the chances of re-election of Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea has criticized Japan’s “ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts” after it announced that anyone arriving from South Korea would be placed in two weeks’ quarantine on government-designated sites.
South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon's impeachment of the government's mismanagement of the epidemic or, on the contrary, praising his response, and the pandemic has allowed countries to adopt emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators expressed concern that this could allow governments to strengthen their power.
In Hungary, parliament voted to authorize Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree until further notice, suspend parliament as well as elections and punish anyone accused of spreading false information about the virus and managing the crisis by the government.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for several instances of supply disruptions, stemming from a global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, panic purchases, and a disruption in plant and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and supplier disruption.
Several localities have also faced panic purchases that have resulted in the disappearance of basic necessities, such as food, toilet paper and water bottles, shelves, resulting in shortages.
The technology sector, in particular, has been alerted to delays in the shipment of electronic products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100-fold.
This demand led to price increases of up to twenty times the normal price and also resulted in delays in the supply of medical devices for a period of four to six months.
This has also led to a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world and WHO warns that this will endanger health professionals.
In Australia, the pandemic offered a new opportunity for daigous to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of infant milk in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the high demand for food products that followed, both areas were spared serious food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal storage and trade of essential products have been a real success, thus avoiding the severe food shortages that had been foreseen in Europe as well as in North America.
Thanks to its large agricultural production, Northern Italy did not see a significant decrease, but prices could increase according to industry representatives.
The food shelves were only temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, as Chinese government members unlocked pork reserves to ensure a sufficient subsistence of the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy for food producers to store reserves for such emergencies.
Negative effects on the global economy were felt in China: according to a March 16 media report, the Chinese economy was hit hard in the first two months of 2020 due to government measures to limit the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell 20.5 percent.
As mainland China is an important economic and manufacturing hub, it has been found that the viral epidemic poses a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicted that markets would remain unstable until a clearer picture emerged on potential outcomes.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could outweigh those of the 2002-2004 SARS epidemic.
An expert from Washington University in St. Louis said the impact on the global supply chain could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is said to have “blurred” after a sharp drop in oil prices due to falling demand in China.
Global stock markets fell on February 24 following a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.

All three indices ended the week with a drop of more than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China’s sovereign debt rating, but retained a negative outlook.
Stocks fell again due to fears about the coronavirus, the biggest drop being seen on March 16.
Many believe that an economic recession is likely.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures put in place by central banks and states.
Central banks react faster than they did in the 2008 financial meltdown.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel bans, closure of public space, including tourist attractions, and government recommendations against any travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines canceled flights due to declining demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while British regional airline Flybe went bankrupt.
The impact on the cruise industry has reached a level never seen before.
Several railway stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The outbreak coincided with Chunyun, a major tourist season associated with the Chinese New Year.
A number of events involving large crowds have been canceled by national and regional governments, including annual New Year festivities, and private companies have also independently closed their stores and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Lunar New Year events have been cancelled and many tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City of Beijing and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China’s 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities have extended the New Year’s holiday until February 10, requiring most workplaces not to reopen before that date.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of the country's GDP and 90 per cent of exports.
Hong Kong has moved to its highest level of response to infectious diseases and declared an emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling its New Year’s Eve festivities. The distribution sector has been impacted globally, with reductions in opening hours or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
In North America and the Middle East, traders saw a 50 to 60 percent decline.
This also led to a 33-43% drop in pedestrian traffic in shopping malls in March compared to February.
Shopping mall operators around the world have imposed additional measures, such as increasing cleaning frequencies, installing thermal scanners to control customer temperatures and canceling events. According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
In China, a large portion of the roughly 300 million rural migrant workers found themselves stranded at home in inland provinces or stuck in Hubei Province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied to the government for help.
The coronavirus epidemic could cost 47 million jobs in the U.S. and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.

The Angus Reid Institute survey observed that 44% of Canadian households had lost some kind of unemployment in Spain.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit. Nearly half a million German companies switched their employees to a government-subsidized partial-activity scheme called Kurzarbeit.
The German system of compensation for part-time work was adopted by France and Great Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been profoundly affected by the pandemic, impacting the functioning of organizations as well as individuals, both salaried and independent, at the global level.
Arts and culture organizations have tried to maintain their (often state-funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, ensure the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists wherever possible.
In March 2020, museums, libraries, theaters and other cultural institutions were closed until further notice and their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intense efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and accelerated consequence of the disease, the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican has announced that the Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which take place in the last week of the Lent period of Christian penance, have been cancelled.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay at home rather than attend Sunday Masses; some churches broadcast their religious services on radio, online and live or on television while others offer to practice his worship as a drive-in.
Like the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome which closed its churches and chapels and St. Peter's Square which emptied itself of all its Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled their services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and Gurdwaras.
Iran's health minister has announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the epidemic and holy sites have since been closed, while Saudi Arabia has banned foreign pilgrims and their inhabitants from entering the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.

Casinos and other gambling establishments around the world have closed and live poker tournaments have either been postponed or cancelled.
This has prompted many players to sign up online, and many online gaming sites have seen a significant increase in their number of new registrations. The show world has also been touched, with several music groups suspending or canceling their concert tours.
Many major theaters, such as those on Broadway, have also interrupted all their performances.
Some artists have sought ways to continue creating and sharing their work on the Internet as a replacement for traditional live performances, such as online and live concerts or online “festivals” created for artists to perform, broadcast and promote their works.
Online, many internet memes on the theme of coronavirus have spread because many prefer humor and distraction in the face of uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 epidemic, there has been a resurgence of prejudice, xenophobia and racism against people of Chinese and East Asian origin, and against people from sensitive areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports dating back to February (while the majority of cases were still limited to China) described racist feelings expressed in different groups around the world that the Chinese deserved the virus or were receiving justifiable punishment.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support has been given to the Chinese, whether online or offline, and to the people living in the areas affected by the virus.
As the epidemic spreads to new sensitive countries, Italians in Europe's first country to suffer a serious COVID-19 outbreak could also face suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have initially signed petitions to ban Chinese from entering their country.
In Japan, the hashtag ?ChineseDontComeToJapan has been raging on Twitter.
Chinese as well as other Asians living in the UK and the US have reported rising levels of racist insults, as well as assaults.
U.S. President Donald Trump has faced criticism for calling the coronavirus a “Chinese virus,” a term critics consider racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreign evacuees between Wuhan and Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeastern India, which shares a border with China, and students in major Indian cities reportedly suffered harassment in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
The president of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s West Bengal unit, Dilip Ghosh, said the Chinese had destroyed nature and “that’s why God took revenge on them.”
The remarks were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, which labels them as “fake”. In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese inhabitants were fueled by the pandemic, with foreigners being described as “foreign waste” that should be “eliminated”.
Many pay-per-view newspapers have removed them for all or part of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made their scientific papers available in connection with the open-access epidemic.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results quickly on pre-publishing servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory screening for coronavirus respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods for detecting the virus and detecting antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This analysis is specifically designed to detect only RNA from the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population monitoring.
Antibody tests reveal how many people have contracted the disease, including people whose symptoms were too mild to report or asymptomatic people.
An exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity among the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited screening, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population in March 2020.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests performed in each country.
This variability is likely to significantly affect reported lethality rates, which are likely to be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using reverse transcription followed by a real-time chain polymerization reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained using various methods, including the nasopharyngeal swab or the expectoration sample.
Results are usually available in a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed from pharyngeal swabs is only reliable during the first week of the disease.
Subsequently, the virus may disappear from the throat as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In infected people tested during the second week, a sample may also be taken from the deep airways by aspiration catheter, or a sputum (sputum) may be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using reverse transcription followed by real-time chain polymerization reaction (rRT-PCR), and was the basis of 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical-grade SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
It detects the “E” gene shared by all beta-coronavirus, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use authorization from the Chinese National Administration of Medical Products for a detection kit of SARS-CoV-2 based on PCR.
Among the older versions of the test kits, one in three genetic tests obtained inconclusive results due to defective reagents, as well as a test bottleneck at the Atlanta CDC. As a result, an average of less than 100 samples per day were successfully treated throughout February 2020.
Testing using two components was not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and it was only then that federal and local laboratories were given permission to begin screening.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization.U.S. commercial laboratories began screening in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp has announced the nationwide availability of COVID-19 tests based on RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics also distributed COVID-19 tests nationwide on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative limitations have been announced. Sampling and processing must be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the National Research Centre in Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On March 12, 2020, it was announced that Mayo Clinic had developed a COVID-19 infection detection test.On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed in large quantities in 3.5 hours, allowing a device to perform approximately 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted an emergency use authorization (USA) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system. The FDA had previously granted a similar authorization to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received a U.S.A. from the FDA for a test that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can deliver positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these devices in the United States, and Abbott plans to step up manufacturing to provide 50,000 tests per day.A test using a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, hoping that it can provide results in 15 to 20 minutes, as a quick test.
A March 2020 literature study concluded that “pulmonary x-rays have a low diagnostic value in the early stages, while the results of CT may be conclusive even before the onset of symptoms.”
Typical symptoms visible on MDD include multi-lobular bilateral frosted glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
Subpleural predominance, crazy paving, and consolidation develop as the disease evolves.
A study comparing PCR to TDM in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, suggested that TDM is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less accurate, with many of its imaging results coinciding with other pneumonias and diseases.
In March 2020, the U.S. College of Radiology recommended that “MDT not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19.” In March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for initial screening.
The production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to infection.
These can be used to detect infection in people from about 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity and as part of population monitoring.Tests can be performed in central laboratories (TLC) or by point-of-care testing (PoCT).
The automated high-throughput systems of many clinical laboratories are capable of performing these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For LC, only one peripheral blood sample is usually used, although serial samples can be used to track the immune response.
For PoCT, only one blood sample is usually taken by cutaneous puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, no extraction steps are required prior to analysis.On March 26, 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that have duly informed the agency and are therefore now able to distribute their antibody testing.
At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorizations for their test kits, capable of detecting IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The screening capacity is several hundred samples in a few hours, which is significantly faster than the viral RNA PCR test.
Antibodies are usually detectable 14 days after the onset of infection.In early April, the UK found that none of the antibody test kits purchased by the country were efficient enough to be used.
Hong Kong has put in place a plan in which suspect cases can stay at home, “the emergency department will disinfect the patient with a sample tube,” patients spit inside, return it, and later receive the test result.The British NHS has announced that it is conducting a pilot project to test suspect cases at home, eliminating the risk that a patient will disinfect himself with a hospital.
In Germany, the National Association of Doctors of Compulsory Health Insurance said on March 2 that it had the capacity to perform some 12,000 tests per day in an outpatient setting, and that 10,700 patients had been tested in the previous week.
The costs are covered by health insurance when the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, drive-tests were available in several major cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, as only positive results are reported.
A first laboratory study found that at the 12/2020 calendar week, a total of at least 483 295 samples from the laboratory were tested by 5 samples from the laboratory, and that 33 491 samples (6.9%) obtained a positive result for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers from the Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method of analysis of samples from the samples.
Thanks to its 5-day construction supervised by Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, modelling revealed that cases in Hubei province would have been 47% higher and that the cost of quarantine would have doubled without this screening capability.
The Wuhan laboratory was quickly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in 12 Chinese cities in total.
As of March 4, 2020, total daily capacity was 50,000 tests per day. Free multiplex models developed by Origami Assays have been published to test up to 1,122 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced models can be run in small laboratories without a liquid manipulator robot.
In March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagents became a bottleneck for mass screening in the EU, UK and US.
This situation prompted some authors to examine sample preparation protocols that involve heating the samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genomes in order to continue screening.On March 31, it was announced that the UAE was now the country testing most of its population per capita for the Coronavirus, and were in the process of detecting it.
These results were obtained through a combination of the ability to conduct drive-tests and the purchase of a population-scale high-speed laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their “Huo-Yan” emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory of this ability to be operational outside of China.
Different test formulas targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German formula to manufacture kits sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on January 17, 2020. The protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control was only published on January 28, delaying the availability of tests in the United States.China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the epidemic, and these countries, as well as Australia, were not able to provide enough specialist kits to meet the demand.
In contrast, specialists say that the high availability of tests in South Korea has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The screening capacity, largely in private sector laboratories, has been strengthened over several years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization recommended intensifying screening programs as the best way to slow the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic.The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus has caused the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States, and the reserves of swabs and chemical reagents have been depleted.
In March 2020, China reported problems related to the reliability of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "defects", and the government removed bureaucratic barriers that hindered private testing.Spain purchased test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found the results to be unreliable.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be related to the inability to collect samples or use the kits correctly.
The Spanish ministry said it will remove the kits that gave the wrong results, and replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits purchased from China by the Czech Republic provided false results. Slovakia bought from China 1.2 million test kits that proved to be faulty.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested throwing them into the Danube. Turkish Ministry of Health’s Ate? Kara said the test kits that Turkey bought from China had a “high error rate” and that it did not “use” them. The UK bought 3.5 million test kits from China, but announced in early April 2020 that they were unusable.
Screening, followed by about forty of those who scored positive and tracking people who had been in contact with SARS-CoV-2 carriers, yielded positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the site of the first COVID-19-related death in Italy, conducted two sets of tests on the entire population of about 3,400 people, at about ten days intervals.
Nearly half of the people who got a positive result had no symptoms, and all cases discovered were quarantined.
With the restriction of travel in the municipality, this measure completely eliminated new infections.
Thanks to aggressive contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has progressed much less quickly than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as forced closures of restaurants and retail outlets.
Many events were canceled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay at home on March 28, but schools reopened on the date scheduled for the end of the holiday on March 23.
Several other countries have also managed the pandemic using aggressive contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, but with less aggressive containment, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that the countries with the most tests, compared to the number of deaths, have much lower fatality rates, probably because these countries are better able to detect people with only mild symptoms or no symptoms at all.
WHO recommends that countries without analytical capacity and whose national laboratories have only limited experience with COVID-19 send their first five positive and ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of WHO's 16 reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Among the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column “Percentage positive tests” depends on the national screening policy.
A country that tests only people admitted to the hospital will have a positive value in % of tests higher than a country that tests all citizens, whether they have symptoms or not, the other factors being the same.
Hand washing, also called hand hygiene, is the cleaning of hands to remove dirt, grease, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
The fact of systematically washing hands with soap at certain "key moments" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by oro-fecal route.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as the flu or cold, for example, by failing to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
It is important to wash your hands with soap at five key times of the day: before and after defecation, after cleaning a baby's buttocks or changing his diapers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If you do not have water or soap on hand, you can wash your hands with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
before, during and after meal preparation;
before and after taking care of a sick person;
after changing the diapers of a baby or cleaning a child who went to the toilet;
after coughing or coughing/sneezing;
after touching an animal, animal feed or animal waste;
Hand hygiene in medical settings refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before administering medication or providing medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals, which can be harmful or cause disease.
This practice is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but also for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; and reducing respiratory infections.
as well as the reduction of infant mortality rate during home births.
According to a 2013 study, improving hand hygiene practices could lead to a slight improvement in the growth of children under the age of five.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates from respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as handwashing with soap.
This simple practice can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Actions to promote hand washing could reduce episodes of diarrhea by about a third, a figure comparable to that achieved by providing drinking water to low-income areas.
Handwashing with soap reduces episodes of diarrhoea by 48% and is the most effective and least costly way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (ARIs) that must be done automatically in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the leading IRAs, is the leading cause of death in children under five years of age, which kills nearly 1.8 million per year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia cause the deaths of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, the habit of washing hands with soap before eating and after going to the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Handwashing is usually associated with other sanitary measures as part of the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Minor deleterious effect, frequent hand washing can damage the skin by causing skin dryness.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to eczema or dermatitis in the hands, characterized by scaly skin and itching, and particularly common among health care workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
It is important to wash your hands with soap at five key times of the day to reduce the oro-fecal transmission of disease: before and after using the toilet (urination, defecation), after cleaning a baby's buttocks (or changing his diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling meat, fish or raw meat.
It is also advisable to wash your hands properly to prevent the transmission of diseases, especially before and after treating a cut or injury, after sneezing, coughing or molting, after touching animal waste or handling animals, and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the rate of hand soap cleaning is low.
According to a 2015 study of 54 countries on hand hygiene, 38.7% of households on average used this type of soap to wash their hands. A 2014 study showed that it was in Saudi Arabia that the rate was the highest (97%), the United States was in the middle of the chart (77%) and China was in the lowest position for most of the time (23%).
For example, the Philipinne Ministry of Education has implemented a "Primary Health Care Program" to promote children's health and education.
Deworming twice a year, combined with daily hand washing with soap and daily toothbrushing with fluoridated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
To better eliminate microorganisms present on the skin, soaps or detergents should be added to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce obstacles to the solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleanser for the skin since lipids and proteins, which are organic soil matter, are hardly soluble in water.
However, adequate water flow facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, can contain bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that the transfer was unlikely because the bacteria are rinsed with foam.
However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that “automatic liquid soap dispensers are preferable.”
Antibacterial soaps have been highly recommended for people who care about their health.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants makes it possible to target antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which many strains of organisms resist.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not the result of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as advertised.
In addition to the surface-active and protective agent of the skin, the most complex formulas containing can contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate the pH, benzoic acid, having an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, extracts of plants).
The hot water used to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water in removing natural oils that carry dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have revealed that the use of warm water does not help to reduce the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or antiseptic is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-aqueous hand hygiene products based on alcohol (commonly called hydroalcoholic solutions, antiseptic solutions for the hands or disinfectants for the hands) began to become popular.
Most are formulated based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol combined with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a gel, or with a moisturizer such as glycerin in order to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of the alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide enhances antimicrobial activity.Hand sanitizers containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydroalcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and ERV), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Alcoholic solutions containing 70% alcohol eliminate 99.97% (reduction of 3.5 log equivalent to a reduction of 35 decibels) of the bacteria present on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of 4 to 5 log) of the bacteria present on the hands 1 minute after application.
Water-alcoholic solutions are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of hand sanitizer or water-alcoholic solution should be used to properly wet or cover both hands.
It is advisable to face the palm and back of both hands as well as the interstices between the fingers and nails for about 30 seconds, until the liquid, foam or gel dries.
It is also necessary to clean the tips of the fingers by rubbing them, palm to palm.The American Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands rather than using hydroalcoholic solutions, especially when the hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and rapid removal of microorganisms; however, they should not replace adequate hand washing unless you have soap and water on hand.
The frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions can cause skin dryness if the formula is not reinforced by skin emollients and/or moisturizing agents.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, water-alcohol solutions containing emollients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in hydroalcoholic solutions are rare.
The fact that hydroalcoholic solutions are less likely to cause irritating contact dermatitis has made them more attractive than washing hands with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not remove organic matter on the hands, but only disinfect them.
It is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, since these remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers depends heavily on the ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based sanitizers.
More recently, formulas that use benzalkonium chloride have exhibited long-lasting and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy subsides after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Among low-income populations, many are those who do not have the means to buy soap, and who instead use ash or land.
Ash or earth can be more effective than water alone, but less than soap.
Moreover, if soil or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease instead of stopping it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing your hands properly to prevent the transmission of disease, by following the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Running water is recommended because of the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while the water temperature does not seem to make a difference).
Make a generous amount of soap foam on your hands by rubbing them against each other, not forgetting the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies reveal that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
The action of rubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and rubbing longer removes more germs.
Rinse thoroughly with running water.
Rinsing in a stagnant pool of water can lead to hand recontamination.
Dry with a clean towel or in the open air.
Wet and moist hands are more easily recontaminated.The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, the spaces between the fingers and the underside of the nails.
Artificial nails and peeled nail polish can house microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; dry skin promotes the appearance of skin lesions that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to washing hands when tap water and/or soap are not available. For example, pouring water from a suspended and drilled can or bottle and/or using ash if necessary, in developing countries. In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas).
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a hanging crucible using a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a soap loaf.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry your hands in the public toilet is debated.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers that are often found in the toilet.
In 2008, a study funded by the paper towel industry, the European Tissue Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster (London), to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper towels, hot air hand dryers and more modern air jet hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands in the hot air hand dryer, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased by an average of 194% on the pulp of the fingers and 254% on the palms.
Air jet hand drying resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the pulp of the fingers by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced by an average of 76% on the pulp of the fingers and up to 77% on the palms.
The air jet hand dryer, which blows air out of the device at advertised speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is able to expel microorganisms from the hands and the device and possibly contaminate other users of the toilet as well as the toilet environment within a perimeter of up to 2 meters.
The use of a hot air hand dryer allows microorganisms to be diffused at a maximum distance of 0.25 meters from the hand dryer.
Paper towels revealed that there was no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by the TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different hand drying methods were evaluated.
After hand drying, the following variations in bacterial count were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying using paper towels.
Hand washing with disinfectant wipes is an alternative solution during travel, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Handwashing in a medical setting became mandatory long after the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) to prevent diseases in a hospital setting.
There are electronic devices that issue reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
One study found that their use resulted in decreased infection rates.
Medical hand washing should last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to foam and rub each part of the hands.
Hands should be rubbed against each other as they pass between the fingers.
In case of residues under the nails, it is possible to use a bristle brush to remove them.
As the germs present in the water are likely to remain on the hands, it is important to rinse well and wipe with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the faucet (and open the exit door if necessary).
This makes it possible to avoid recontamination of the hands in contact with the surfaces.
The goal of hand washing in health facilities is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (“germs”) and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the insufficient rate of hand cleaning remains unacceptable in most medical institutions, with many doctors and nurses regularly forgetting to wash their hands before touching their patients, which promotes the transmission of microorganisms.
According to one study, washing hands properly and following other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related blood infections by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a brochure outlining the standard procedure for washing and rubbing hands in the health field.
The draft guidelines on hand hygiene prepared by the Organization can also be consulted on the website to collect feedback from Internet users.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercially available devices can measure and certify hand hygiene if compliance is proven.
The World Health Organization defines "Five Indications" for hand hygiene:
after exposure to blood/biological fluid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
adding antiseptic chemicals to the soap (‘drug’ or ‘antimicrobial’ soaps) gives the handwashing agent a germ-killing action.
It is desirable to remove these germs before performing a surgical operation or in environments where antibiotic-resistant organisms are widespread. To "scrub" the hands for a surgical operation, it is necessary to have a faucet that can be opened and closed without touching it with the hands, a washing product based on sewage or sewage.
All jewelry must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash your hands and forearms to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to rub your hands for 10 minutes.
When rinsing, water on the forearms should not flow to the hands.
Once the hands have been washed, it is advisable to dry your hands using a sterile linen and put on a surgical coat.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
Regarding the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained during the first 20% of washing, and that there were very few additional benefits of increasing the frequency of hand washing by more than 35%.
If you compare hand washing done with an ordinary soap to that done with an antibacterial soap, the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food is more than three times higher. Similarly, by comparing hand cleaning with an alcohol-based solution and hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average duration of 30 seconds, it is found that the first contamination reduces the second ratio of 6% to the first.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based products in reducing the influenza A virus (H1N1) and Clostridium difficile spores present on the hands. To improve hand hygiene in health care facilities, it is possible to train staff in hand washing, to make more alcohol-based products available to him and him.
Further research is needed to find out what are the most effective interventions in different health structures.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is considered an inexpensive and essential tool for maintaining health or even eating properly.
However, due to the lack of reliable water, soap or handwashing facilities at home, at school and at work, it is difficult to establish universal hand hygiene habits.
For example, in much of rural Africa, it is rare to find hand-washing taps near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options for building hand-washing stations.
However, low handwashing rates can also be attributable to tenacious habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting hand washing with soap and conducting awareness-raising activities can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of soap washing and lead to long-term behavioural change in the population.
For this to be successful, monitoring and evaluation activities are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that local approaches are effective in increasing the rate of handwashing in low- and middle-income countries, and that social marketing campaigns are less effective. In terms of promoting handwashing in schools, we can cite the example of the "Three-Star Approach" of UNICEF, which encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive measures with respect to their own rules.
Once the minimum standards are met, schools can switch from one to the final three stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be part of the hand hygiene promotion campaigns that are conducted to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness campaign that purports to foster changing behaviours.Following the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating handwashing.
Few studies have looked at the overall cost-effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries compared to the number of healthy years gained (i.e. DALYs avoided).
However, one review suggests that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, especially for people in vulnerable situations such as mothers just giving birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first identified in the mid-nineteenth century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and the British "founder" Florence Nightingale in modern day.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to foul odors called miasmas.
In the 1980s, food-borne outbreaks and nosocomial infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as an essential means of preventing the spread of infections.
The onset of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have led to greater awareness in many countries about the need to wash hands with soap to guard against these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating “good hand washing techniques” were placed next to sinks in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The term "washing one's hands" refers to a person's refusal to take responsibility or to be an accomplice in something.
It comes from a Bible verse of Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washes his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but this expression has spread widely in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain, symbolizing her bad conscience in the face of the crimes she committed and which she incited her husband to commit.
It has also been found that some people, after remembering or considering unethical acts, tend to wash their hands more often than others and value handwashing devices more.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having these kinds of thoughts are less likely to engage in other “purification” compensatory measures, such as volunteering.
Some religions prescribe hand washing for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. The symbolic hand washing, which consists of using water and not soap to wash hands, is part of the hand washing rituals put forward in many religions, including Baha'i and Hinduism.
According to Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash your hands after going to the toilet.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing their hands before and after each meal.
Controls of COVID-19 risks in the workplace
Risk controls for COVID-19 in the workplace mean the implementation of occupational health and safety methodologies for risk control for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Adequate workplace risk controls vary by workplace and task, based on an assessment of exposure sources, disease severity in the community, and individual risk factors for workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19 infection.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, jobs with a lower risk of exposure have minimal professional contact with the public and other collaborators. In this case, only basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, and maintaining a respiratory tag as well.
Jobs at risk of medium exposure include those that require frequent or close contact with people without suspected or known COVID-19, but who may be infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, particularly in schools, high-density work environments and certain high-volume retail environments.
Risk controls in this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using highly effective air filters, hygienic windows and the provision of personal protective equipment in the event of a meeting with a person with COVID-19.
OSHA considers sanitary and funeral workers exposed to people with suspected or known COVID-19 to be at high risk of exposure, moving to a very high risk if they perform procedures that produce aerosols or sample sampling or manipulation of people with suspected or known COVID-19.
Appropriate risk controls for these workers include technical controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment adapted to the task.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have several effects in the workplace.
Workers may be absent because they have fallen ill, have to take care of other people or fear possible exposure.
Business models can change, both with regard to the goods requested and the means of acquiring them (including shopping outside peak hours or using delivery or drive services).
Finally, the shipment of items from geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be discontinued. A preparedness and response plan for infectious diseases may be used as a guide for protective measures.
The plans take into account the levels of risk associated with different workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors related to family and community context, and individual risk factors of workers such as advanced age or chronic conditions.
They also outline the necessary controls to address these risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of outbreaks.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be the subject of national or regional recommendations.
Epidemic response goals include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people at higher risk of medical complications, maintaining business operations, and reducing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the company is located influences the responses applied.
The Risk Control Hierarchy forms a framework widely used in occupational health and safety in order to group risk controls by effectiveness.
When COVID-19 risks cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are technical checks, followed by administrative checks and finally personal protective equipment.
Technical checks involve isolating employees from work-related risks without having to rely on worker behaviour and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls refer to changes in policies or procedures at work that require action on the part of the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of PPE must be selected based on risk to the worker, properly adapted as needed (e.g., respiratory masks), properly and systematically worn, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced as needed, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to prevent contamination.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, jobs with a lower risk of exposure have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, respiratory labeling, including covering the mouth and nose for coughing and sneezing, providing handkerchiefs and trash cans, preparing for telework and other work hours.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially infectious people is a crucial step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory disease stay at home until they no longer show family fever, signs of fever or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using feverish or other medications to treat the symptoms.
According to the OSHA, jobs at average risk include those that require frequent or close contact, within six feet of people without suspected or known COVID-19, but who may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community transmission around the company headquarters or because the person has recently made an international trip to a region with widespread COV transmission.
This includes workers' protection from workers' protection to workers' protection from workers' protection to workers' protection, from workers' protection to workers' protection, from workers' protection to workers' protection, from workers' protection to workers' protection, from workers' protection to workers' protection, from workers' protection to workers' protection, from workers' protection to workers' protection, from workers' protection to workers' protection, from workers' protection to workers' protection, from workers' protection to workers' protection, from workers' protection, from workers' protection from workers' protection from workers' protection from workers' protection, from from from workers' protection from workers' protection from from from workers' protection, from from from from workers' protection from from from from workers' protection, from workers' protection, from from from from from from from workers' protection from workers' protection from from workers' protection from workers' protection, from from from from from from from from from from from workers' protection, from from from from from from workers from from from from from from from from from from from from from from workers' protection, from workers' protection, from workers from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from workers' protection, from from from workers' protection, from from from from from from from from from from workers' protection, from workers' protection, from from from from from from from from from from from from workers' protection, from workers' protection, from from workers' protection from, from from from from from from from workers' protection, from from from from from from from from workers' protection from workers' protection, from workers' protection, from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from, from, from from from, from, from, from, from from from from from from, from from from from from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, in, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, in, in, from, from, in, from, in, in, in, from, in, in, from, in, from, from, from, in, from, from, in, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, in, in, from, in, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, in, in, from, from, in, from, from, from, from, from, from, in, in, from, from, in, from, from, from, in, from, from, from, in, from, from, from, in, in, in, in, in, in, from, from, from, from, from, from, in, in, in, from, from, from, from, from, in, in, from, from, in, from, from, in, from, from, from, in, in, in, from, from, from, in, in, from, from, from, from, from, from, in, in, in, in, from, from, from, from, from, from, in, from, from, from, from, in, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, in, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, in, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, in, from, from, in, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from
Workers in this risk group rarely need to wear breathing masks.
If a person falls ill on board an aeroplane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include: separating the patient from others by a distance of 6 feet, appointing a crew member to care for the patient and offering a protective mask to the patient or asking him to cover his mouth and nose with handkerchiefs when he coughs or sneezes.
The cabin crew shall wear disposable medical gloves when caring for a sick passenger or touching organic liquids or potentially contaminated surfaces and, where possible, additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough or breathing difficulties.
Gloves and other disposable items must be disposed of in a bag for hazardous biological waste and contaminated surfaces must be cleaned and disinfected thereafter. For commercial navigation, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk checks include deferral of travel in the event of illness as well as self-isolation and immediate information from the on-board medical centre if any other development occurs.
Ideally, medical follow-up should take place in the cabin of the isolated person. For schools and child care facilities, CDC recommends a short-term closure for cleaning and disinfection purposes if an infected person has visited a school building, regardless of community spread.
In case of minimal to moderate community transmission, strategies of social distancing can be implemented, such as cancelling educational outings, assemblies and other important gatherings such as physical or choral education classes or canteen meals, increasing the space between offices, staggering the hours of arrival and departure, reducing non-essential visitors and using a separate gripp store.
In case of significant transmission in the local community, in addition to strategies of social distancing, an extension of the school holidays can be considered. For law enforcement who carry out routine daily activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who are required to come into contact with people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 must follow the same guidelines as paramedics, including wearing adequate personal protective equipment.
In case of close contact during an arrest, workers must clean and disinfect their equipment and service belt before re-use with a household detergent wipe or spray and follow standard procedures for confinement and disposal of used PSA as well as confinement and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers some sanitary and funeral workers as belonging to categories with high or very high risk of exposure.
High-risk jobs include health care, support, laboratory and medical transportation workers who are exposed to patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
They become workers at very high risk of exposure if they perform procedures that produce aerosols or sample sampling or manipulation of patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
Aerosol-producing procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, certain dental examinations and procedures, or invasive sampling.
Funeral jobs at high risk of exposure include workers involved in preparing the bodies of people with suspected or known COVID-19 at the time of their death; they go on to a very high risk of exposure if they perform an autopsy. Additional technical checks of these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with suspected or known COVID-19, including when performing procedures that produce COVID-19.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some sanitary and funerary environments.
Samples shall be handled using Level 3 biosafety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends separating incoming patients into separate waiting rooms based on the suspicion of COVID-19. In addition to the other PIDs, OSHA recommends respiratory masks for people working within 6 feet of patients with suspected or known SARS-CoV-2 infection and for those performing procedures that produce aerosols.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 filtration respiratory masks or higher must be used in the context of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program including adaptation, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory masks can provide superior protection and better comfort to the worker. WHO does not recommend combinations, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted by organic fluids.
WHO recommends wearing a surgical mask only by screening staff at the point of entry.
For those who collect respiratory samples, take care of or carry COVID-19 patients in the absence of procedures that produce aerosols, WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective glasses or a facial screen, a gown and gloves.
In the case of an aerosol-producing procedure, the surgical mask is replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respiratory mask.
Since the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends limiting the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting access to a room occupied by a COVID-19 patient to the people directly involved in its care, using the PPE needed for the specific task only, continuous use of the same masking without breathing.

SUBJECT: [Covid-19] Relieving the burden and preparing for the future
SHIPPING DATE/TIME: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENCE: CC0: No rights reserved
We are in an exceptional situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a clear demonstration of our global human interconnectedness and our responsibilities to each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best response is based on the kind of global empathy, cooperation and community building that is at the heart of this organization.
The camaraderie and kindness we have observed among all our colleagues in emails, calls and instant conversations is a remarkable testimony of the incredible human beings with whom we have the chance to work.
I could not be more grateful and proud to have you all among my colleagues.
Last week, someone expressed their gratitude for our work.
This person reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to view Wikipedia right now, and the strong symbol that this essential resource remains online and accessible to everyone.
This is possible thanks to your work, whether you maintain operational sites, ensure the payment of our colleagues or the safety of our communities.
The world needs the information provided by Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do, but also how we do it, will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and the role you play in it, we will make substantial adjustments to how we work together starting next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the team-c met last night to discuss our approach and schedule in the days and months ahead.
During this conversation, we considered what we believe would be an appropriate response to the situation we are facing and the best way to ensure the sustainability of the organization during this period.
Above all, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to take a step back, don’t worry.
To all staff, subcontractors and contractors:
our daily working time target will be about 4 hours per day, i.e. 20 hours per week until further notice.
We do not declare a public holiday: if you are able to insure more normal working hours, you can be useful to the mission.
However, the world is unpredictable at the moment, and if you need to take care of your loved ones, go shopping or see a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We do not monitor your hours.
If you are sick, do not work.
It should go without saying, but we say it.
No sick leave or paid leave required: simply notify your supervisor and help your team review schedules and schedules to ensure key areas of work are covered.
(If you are diagnosed positive to COVID-19, please notify Bryan of the T&amp;C Ops department for the T&amp;C to help you and make sure your situation gets the necessary attention from management).
Hourly staff will be fully paid.
We have already announced this, and we reiterate our commitment to honour our responsibilities to our subcontractors and fellow hourly staff.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their normal working hours performed under normal conditions.
This is true if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to relieve their stress related to the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like this.
Once again, the goal is to preserve yourself.
We just ask you to contact your superior so that we know what to expect and can make the necessary arrangements.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are some things we must continue to do.
The SRE, Ops HR, Confidence & Fundraising (among others) teams are doing a critical job that may need reinforcement.
We will initiate a process with all departments to assess current objectives and focus on supporting core tasks for our mission.
There is enough work for each of us, we will just focus on the most indispensable projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt later.
We do not intend to “work twice as hard to catch up with the lost time” when the pandemic is over.
We will not ask you to work overtime to meet now unrealistic deadlines.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and will strive to establish new objectives and timelines where appropriate.
What about the APP (Annual Planning)?
In order to adapt to our new reality and daily work time targets, we plan to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that provides more time to establish a budget to allow employees to focus on the essential work, take care of themselves and their loved ones while adapting to those who need or want to see their work schedule reduced in the weeks ahead.
This extension of deadlines significantly reduces the workload and pressure of current planning across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and inform delegates and teams of the next steps as soon as confirmed.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Situation, exhibition and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our San Francisco-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, out of extreme caution, we used an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used a hospital-grade antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance hall and elevator cages leading to our floor.
The building uses its own due diligence protocol that uses products that ensure the safety of its tenants.
We are confident that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return to it.
Our Washington D.C. office is located in a WeWork premises, which shared with us and all staff members based in Washington D.C. its COVID-19 protocol.
Since last week, our Washington, D.C. office has adopted a fully remote configuration in accordance with the advice of San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also debated the idea of renting a local in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing but could be postponed.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who are used to remote work are aware that adaptation can be difficult and would like to offer you some advice:
Reduce the duration of meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider spreading them over several days.
Clearly define the meeting, have an agenda and send documentation in advance.
Make videos the norm, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to encourage collaboration and live exchanges.
Have a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the instant conversation and list of speakers, and someone to help take notes (or make a collective note-taking).
Email technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your wellness refund for snacks.
Join the Slack channel to talk to your colleagues about the distribution of work
The HR Operations team is studying ergonomic guidelines based on webinars to support the increase in the distribution of work in the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all community grant recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as edit-a-thons, until the WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We have explained to them that we understand that our cancellation requests and other restrictions may make it impossible to carry out their agreed grant activities and that no one would be penalized in the event of delay or modification of these objectives.
Next week we will publish additional guidelines on Wikimania and other thematic and regional community conferences.
The general feeling of the international community seems to be both sadness at the upheaval and relief at the clarity and the opportunity to focus on its own communities, Wikimedia and others.
As for the sequel, the CRT is working to create a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and continue our communications with them.
Staying in touch despite COVID-19 issues
We will send an invitation to your calendars for an extraordinary staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will take advantage of this moment to share other updates, answer your questions and spend time together.
This situation concerns all of us and we are here to help you in any way.
Until then, you can still find the information contained in this email, as well as all other essential information related to the COVID-19, on the Office Wiki.
The CRT will update these pages and gather all the information in one place.
We also strive to maintain regular communications with staff living in countries that are currently severely affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, a large workflow or coverage issues, or if you need help with anything else, do not hesitate to notify and work with the CRT.
We are here to support you and provide liaison if necessary.
For any confidential or sensitive questions, please email Bryan Judan, Director of Global HR Operations.
None of these changes should be considered an abandonment of our work and obligations.
On the contrary, it is a matter of acknowledging that, at present, our work and our obligations will probably have to adapt in an unprecedented way.
These are the steps we deem necessary to support each other and to be able to continue our work, to provide our movement with the help it needs, and to offer the world the service that everyone can count on.
Our planned work will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to help each other and prepare for the important work that will come in the weeks and perhaps months ahead.
We need each one of you to achieve this, which is why you need to preserve yourself and take care of your families so that you can give the best of yourself when the time comes.
Finally, please: wash your hands and do not touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the management team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
The angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2) is an enzyme linked to the outer face (cellular membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney and intestines.
ACE2 against the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing Ang (1-7) making it a promising drug target in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ACE2 is also the entry point into the cells of certain coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
The angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an N-terminated peptidase domain M2 and a C-terminated renal amino acid-carrying collectrin domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein whose enzymatic active domain is exposed on the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme called sheddase; the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and finally excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is linked to the cell membrane mainly from cells in the lung alveoli type II, enterocytes in the small intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial cells in the smooth muscles of most organs.
The expression of ACE2 mRNA is also present in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brain stem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to compensate for ACE.
ACE clives the hormone angiotensin I into vasoconstrictor angiotensin II.
ACE2 in turn clinks the carboxyl-terminated amino acid phenylamine of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis into vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-
ACE2 can also cleave several other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apeline, neurotensin, dynorphine A, and ghreline.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane circulation of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the primary entry point into the cells of certain coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus behind SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus behind COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the SARS-CoV spicule protein S1 and SARS-CoV2 to the enzymatic domain of ACE2 to the cell surface results in endocytosis and in the translocation of both the virus and the enzyme into the endosomes located inside the cells.
This entry process also requires the initiation of the S protein by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, inhibition of the latter is currently being investigated as a potential treatment. This leads some to believe that the reduction of ACE2 levels in cells can help fight infection.
However, several professional companies and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing standard treatment using ACE inhibitor and ARB.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 showed that “the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a 34% significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control subjects.”
In addition, “the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in ACE inhibitor-treated patients who were at higher risk of pneumonia, particularly stroke and heart failure victims.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less evident than for the overall risk of pneumonia."
The recombinant human angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (rhACE2) is thought to be an innovative treatment of severe lung lesions and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the time to action is 30 minutes in addition to the 24-hour duration of effect.
Several findings suggest that rhACE2 could be a promising drug for people who are intolerant to conventional renin-angiotensin (RAS) inhibitors or for diseases with high circulation of angiotensin II.
COVID-19 applications are mobile applications designed to facilitate the tracking of contacts in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the identification of people (“contacts”) likely to have come into contact with an infected individual.
Various applications have been developed or proposed, with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several infrastructures have been developed for the design of contact tracing applications.
These systems, particularly those based on tracking the geographical location of application users, raise privacy issues.
There are other less intrusive options, including using Bluetooth signals to record a user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced the direct integration into their Android and iOS operating systems of a feature to support these Bluetooth apps.
The Chinese government, in association with Alipay, has deployed an app in China that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with people carrying COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities, and Singapore has opted for an app called TraceTogether.
Developed by a local community of computer scientists, it has been provided as open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth application that tracks exposure to potentially infected people and communicates quickly with health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval by the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government said that the contact tracking app was in an advanced development stage and could be deployed in the coming weeks. A similar application is planned in Ireland and France (“StopCovid”).
Australia and New Zealand are planning to implement applications based on the TraceTogether model in Singapore and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia wants to introduce a geo-tracking application for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and residing in Moscow, to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, discussed several possible practical problems related to the use of application-based systems, including false positives and potential inefficiency if only a small part of the population uses the application.
In response to concerns about the spread of deceptive or harmful coronavirus apps, Apple only allows “official” or generally trustworthy agencies to add coronavirus-related apps to the App Store.
Google and Amazon have similar restrictions.
Privacy activists have raised concerns about the implications of coronavirus applications for mass surveillance, particularly the possible dismantling of the surveillance infrastructure created to address the coronavirus pandemic once the threat is removed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the limitation of such surveillance.
These organizations stipulated eight conditions to be met in government projects:
monitoring should be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
extensions of control and surveillance should include extinguishing clauses;
The use of data should be limited to COVID-19 control objectives.
Data security and anonymity should be demonstrably protected;
Digital surveillance should ensure that discrimination and marginalisation are not exacerbated;
Any sharing of data with third parties should be defined by law;
protections against abuse and remedies for citizens in case of abuse should be provided;
“Significant participation” of all “stakeholders concerned” would be mandatory, including that of public health experts and marginalized groups. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporter ohne Grenzen (RSF) in Germany have also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to tackle the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the operating system tracking mechanism from their devices as soon as it is no longer needed.
Some countries have used a network location system instead of applications, eliminating both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network tracking has been approved.
Network solutions with access to raw geolocation data present significant potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems relying on central servers need access to personal location data; several systems have been created to use central servers only for intercommunication, which allows privacy to be respected (see next section).
In South Korea, a non-app system has been used for contact tracing.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking and card transaction data, which they then associated to send SMS warnings to potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to warn potential contacts, the government also made location information publicly available, which was allowed following the profound changes in information privacy laws following the MERS outbreak in this country.
This information is accessible to the public through several applications and websites. Countries such as Germany have considered the use of centralized systems to preserve privacy.
Details had not yet been released on April 6, 2020.
Privacy contact tracking is a well-established concept, backed by a large volume of research data as early as 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, including using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to record a user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
However, the PEPP-PT project is a coordination effort that combines centralized and decentralized approaches and does not constitute a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, formerly called Contact Event Contact Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Mobile Mes
These protocols ensure that identifiable personal data never leaves the device and that all matching is done on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab is currently developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy techniques when collecting and using location or contact data to track the spread of COVID-19.
This technique is based on the results of the White Paper “Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic” published in March 2020. The SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company developing privacy technologies originally founded at MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities, without compromising their privacy.
On April 5, 2020, the TCN International Coalition was founded by groups gathered around a common approach and essentially equivalent protocols, in order to reduce fragmentation and ensure global interoperability of tracking and alerting applications, a key factor in their adoption by a broad audience.
On April 9, 2020, the government of Singapore announced the release of the source code of the BlueTrace protocol used by its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative, saying it would preserve privacy and combine Bluetooth Low Energy technology and privacy-enhancing cryptography.
They also published the specifications of the core technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
Deployment of tools for governments to create official privacy-friendly coronavirus tracking applications
Google and Apple plan to address issues of solution adoption and persistence of monitoring by initially distributing the system through OS updates and later removing it in the same way once the threat is removed.
Repositioning a drug (also called reorientation, reprofiling, reassignment or change of therapeutic indication of a drug) means the conversion of a drug approved for a disease or medical condition different from the one for which it was originally developed.
This is an axis of scientific research currently being studied to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other avenues of research include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and plasma transfusion from convalescent people. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 therapeutic target proteins, each with multiple ligand binding sites.
The analysis of these binding sites offers the realistic project for the development of an antiviral drug effective against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-type protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, protein S and ADP ribose phosphate.
Hussein A A, et al. studied several candidate compounds that they then optimized and analyzed to determine their structural similarity to the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study to be recommended in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug also used for certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under an emergency use authorization.
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorized under the U.S. only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients who cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC stated that “the use, dosage or duration of administration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection” is not yet established.
Doctors have indicated using this drug "when there is no other option."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Extensive studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU Langone Medical School conducts a trial on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen said favipiravir was “clearly effective.”
35 patients in Shenzhen were tested negative within an average of 4 days while the duration of the disease was 11 days in the 45 patients who had not received it.
In a Wuhan study of 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir and the other half received umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency has reminded the public that the existing evidence in favor of the drug is thin and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug in Japan for its reserves and that it would use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals where the drug would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has opened up opportunities for the Trump administration to acquire the drug. The drug may be less effective in severe cases of the disease where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or those trying to procreate.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), an antiviral combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that “no benefit was observed”.
These drugs have been designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify these drugs to find a compound that would bind to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. There are criticisms in the scientific community about the use of resources for the repositioning of drugs specially developed for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections. Gilead Sciences then discovered that remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against several filoviruses, pneumoviruses, paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses.
One problem with antiviral therapy is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some early studies before the trial suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals; one involving people with moderate pathology and the other involving those with more severe forms.
There are three ongoing clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C for people who are hospitalized and seriously ill with COVID-19; two controlled against placebo (China and Canada) and one without control (Italy).
New York State began testing for the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
The Japanese National Center for Health and Global Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial of Teijin alvesco (ciclesonide), an inhalation corticosteroid used for asthma, for the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
A form of angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme, a phase II trial is underway with 200 patients to be recruited from among the severe cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with moderate symptoms of COVID-19.
The study called COLCORONA recruits 6,000 adults 40 years of age and older who have been diagnosed positive for COVID-19 and have moderate symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant or breastfeeding women or women who do not have an effective method of contraception are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, prompting the Italian drug agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study of 300 patients studying the use of enoxaparin sodium in preventive and therapeutic dosages was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a large number of researchers have focused on repositioning approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for earlier outbreaks such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin recommended for COVID-19 treatment according to 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir recommended for COVID-19 treatment according to 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially repositionable as COVID-19 treatments:
tocilizumab (anti-receptor-IL-6): approved by China.
Testing is also underway in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab-COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed clinical trials, many developmental attempts are underway.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said no vaccine was expected against SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the disease, before at least 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were under Phase I safety study.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major epidemic erupted around the world in 2020, spawning significant investments and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Defined in April, the requirements of the CEPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were conducting research and development projects in early 2020 with the aim of creating an effective COVID-19 vaccine.
Targets for the main platform that have passed Phase I safety studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenoviral vector type 5)
As CEPI scientists stated in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development of which 78 (79 according to the Milken Institute) confirmed as active and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (presumed to be in the planning or design process).
A Phase I-II trial conducts preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, is usually randomized, placebo-controlled and conducted in multiple centers while determining more accurate effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and test the effectiveness of the vaccine in disease prevention, while monitoring adverse reactions at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active-development vaccine candidates (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were not yet in the human assessment phase (still in “preclinical” research).
Around January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was studying the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.
Around January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan announced that it has started working on a vaccine, which is expected to begin testing on humans in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on January 26, 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28.
Around January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that it has begun working on the development of a vaccine.
Janssen develops an oral vaccine in collaboration with its biotechnology partner, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a paper on the design of a vaccine with technology similar to that of neoantigen vaccination used for cancer treatment.
On March 25, the director of the research institute announced that they had finalized the synthesis of the vaccine and that they were beginning the tests.
On February 27, 2020, a Generex subsidiary, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced it had begun a vaccine project with the aim of creating a vaccine based on Ii-Key peptides against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested in humans “within 90 days.”
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its project to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Material Command in Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, both located in western Maryland, announced work on a vaccine.
Around March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it is partnering with Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners also announced preclinical test projects and a Phase I clinical trial for July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were working on 11 isolates and that even in accelerated procedure, it would take about a year and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company from Quebec, Quebec, reported developing a coronavirus-like particle thanks to partial funding from Canadian health research institutes.
The vaccine candidate is being researched in the lab, with tests on humans scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, the Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered CureVac “large sums of money for exclusive access to the COVID-19 vaccine,” prompting protest from the German government.
On March 17, 2020, US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech for the joint development of an mRNA vaccine.
Candidate BNT162 mRNA vaccine is currently in preclinical testing with clinical trials expected in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020 in Italy, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and that the human test of its final vaccine candidate could begin in the fall.
In France, on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a consortium to research a COVID-19 vaccine including the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total investment of CEPI against US$19 million in vaccine development.
Other CEPI investment partners for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists had begun animal testing of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of the sequence being sent by China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced funding of $275 million for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
Around the same time, the Canadian government announced the allocation of C$192 million for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine with plans to create a national "vaccine bank" containing several new vaccines that can be used if other coronavirus outbreaks occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a potential COVID-19 vaccine in mice, stating that "subunits of SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccines administered by microneedles triggered an important response of antigen-specific antibodies [in mice] observed 2 weeks after
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate in the potential form of a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, the DNA will be designed to replicate in human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to virus particles that could stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities pooled their resources to access IBM supercomputers, coupled with cloud-hosted computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can offer benefits beyond the disease they are preventing.
Another randomized trial in Australia plans to include 4,170 health professionals.
Vaccines in development may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the efficacy of a vaccine using COVID-19-specific animal models, such as transgenic ACE-2 mice, other laboratory animals, non-human primates, indicate a need for implementation of level 3 biosecurity containment measures for handling live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
SARS and MERS vaccines have been tested in non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no curative or protective vaccine against SARS that has demonstrated both its safety and efficacy in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, identifying and developing new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS was a priority for governments and health agencies around the world.
When MERS spread, it was thought that existing SARS research could serve as a model for developing vaccines and drugs against MERS-CoV infection.
By March 2020, only one MERS vaccine (based on DNA) had completed Phase I clinical trials in humans and three more were ongoing; all vaccines were viral vector, two adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts spread a conspiracy theory that the virus behind COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents cited by various social media publications refer to existing patents on genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus 2 linked to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of taste, and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
While most cases cause moderate symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported worldwide in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have healed. The virus spreads mainly during proximity contact, often through droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or speaking.
Since these droplets are produced upon expiration, they usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces rather than pose an infectious risk over long distances.
People can also get infected by touching a contaminated surface, then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious in the first three days after symptom onset, although contagion is possible prior to symptom onset and in the later stages of the disease. The standard test method uses reverse transcription of the chain reaction by real-time polymerase (rRT-PCR).
The use of masks is recommended for those who think they are infected with the virus and for their caregivers.
Recommendations for the wearing of the mask by the general public vary, with some authorities not advising on its use, others recommending its use, and still others requiring its use.
There is currently no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in the six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus can be asymptomatic or develop flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty walking and a blue face or lips; in the presence of these symptoms, it is advisable to consult a doctor immediately.
Less frequently, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed in varying proportions.
Some cases in China initially showed only chest pressure and palpitations.
In some, the disease can cause pneumonia, failure of several organs, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can be up to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected people will develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known, however preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people infected without symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied.The Korean Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The Chinese National Health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1; of 166 infections reported today, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
Both sputum and saliva can carry large viral loads.
Speaking loudly releases more droplets than speaking normally.
A study in Singapore found that unprotected coughing can project droplets from a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is generally not airborne, the National Academy of Sciences suggested that bioaerosol transmission might be possible and that air collectors positioned in the corridor outside the patient's chambers produced positive samples to viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can disperse respiratory secretions and thus lead to airborne spread.
Although there are concerns about spread through the stool, this risk is perceived as low. The virus is most contagious when people have symptoms; although spread may be possible before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that if it is not yet known exactly how easily the disease spreads, one person usually contaminates two to three others.
Precisely, the virus was detected after one day on cardboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and after four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies depending on the humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents are also effective when used properly; soap-based products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus, disabling it and removing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample revealed the highest viral load, while in the sixth patient the highest viral load was on the second day tested.
Coronavirus 2 linked to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia linked to the focus of cases of Wuhan acute respiratory disease.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in coronaviruses related in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is a close relative of the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells via the angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2), which is most abundant in lung type II alveolar cells.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called a "spikle" (peplomer) to bind to ACE 2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart damage has been reported in 12% of people admitted to Wuhan Hospital, China, and is more common when the disease is more severe.
Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, however acute myocardial lesions may also be linked to ACE 2 receptors in the heart.
ACE-2 receptors are strongly expressed in the heart and in the cardiac functions involved.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolic disease (25%) was observed in intensive care unit patients with COVID-19 infections and may be associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Autopsies of people who died from COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 presents a tropism for respiratory epithelial cells that express ACE-2, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, GM-CSF secreting T cells have been associated with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes secreting IL6 and with severe pulmonary pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocyte infiltrates have also been reported for autopsy.
The WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method uses reverse transcription of the chain reaction by real-time polymerase (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained by rhinopharyngeal sampling; however, nasal or sputum sampling may also be used.
Generally, results are available in a few hours or up to two days.
Blood tests can also be used, however they require two blood samples taken two weeks apart and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world were able to independently develop chain polymerization reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection with the virus.
On April 4, 2020, antibody tests (possibly to detect active infections and a person’s previous infection) were under development, but not yet widely used.
The Chinese test experiment revealed an accuracy of only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the U.S. approved the first test closest to the patient on March 21, 2020 to be used later this month. Diagnostic guidelines published by Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Multi-lobular bilateral frosted glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are typical symptoms visible at the onset of infection.
Dominance under pleural, crazy paving (interlobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may occur with the progression of the disease.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings at autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary edema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
moderate pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocytic hyperplasia, extensive atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multinuclear giant cells
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Pneumonia in the process of healing: organization of exudates in the alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIVC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, frequently washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering your mouth and nose with a handkerchief when you cough or sneeze and using the inside of your elbow in the absence of a handkerchief.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommended covering one's face with tissue in public places to limit transmission in cases of asymptomatic individuals.Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact between infected individuals and large groups by closing schools and workplaces, reducing travel and cancelling large groupings of people.
Distance guidelines also include respecting a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) between people.
There are no drugs known to be effective in preventing COVID-19. Given that a vaccine is not expected before 2021 at the earliest, a key element of COVID-19 management is trying to reduce the epidemic peak, which is also called "flattening the curve".
The CDC also recommends individuals wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after being in the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after molting, coughing, or sneezing.
It also recommends the use of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol, but only if water and soap are not available. For areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not available, WHO offers two formulas for local production.
In these formulae, the antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to remove bacterial spores in alcohol, it is "not an antiseptic active substance for the hands".
Glycerin is added as a moisturizer.
People are treated with supportive care that may include water treatment, oxygen therapy, and support of other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of carrying the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat cases of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being analyzed.
Personal hygiene, a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to promote immunity.
Supportive treatments can be useful for those with moderate symptoms in the early stages of infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of hospitalized people for COVID-19.
Resuscitating doctors and pulmonologists in the United States have put together therapeutic recommendations from several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
Regarding symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen on the front line.
Caution should be taken to minimise the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in conditions of care where the procedures may generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
For healthcare professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in an Airborne Infection Infection Insulation (AIRI) isolation room in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and airborne transmission precautions. The CDC highlights guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: PPE blouse, respiratory or facial mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, respiratory masks (face masks) are preferred.
N95 respiratory masks are approved under industrial conditions, but the FDA has authorized the use of these masks under an emergency use authorization (USA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for unindicated uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face shields, or as a last resort, handmade masks.
The majority of COVID-19 cases are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory assistance for people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is actively studied for hospitalized people. Some evidence indicates that intubation can be avoided using a high-flow nasal cannula or positive double-level airway pressure.
It is not known whether one or both of these benefits are the same for people in critical condition.
Some physicians prefer to stick to invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the diffusion of aerosol particles compared to a high-flow nasal cannula. Severe cases are more common in older adults (those over 60, and especially those over 80).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per person, which limits the ability of the care system to treat a sudden spike in the number of COVID-19 cases severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China showed that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care, 2.3% needed respiratory assistance and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are finally admitted to intensive care.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilation devices with pressure control modes and high PEEP are needed to optimize oxygen delivery and minimize the risk of ventilation-associated lung injury and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilation appliances.
The search for potential treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are being clinically tested.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may not be developed before 2021, several drugs being tested are already approved in other indications and tests are already advanced.
An antiviral drug can be tried in people with a severe illness.
WHO has recommended that volunteers participate in trials on the efficacy and safety of potential treatments, and the FDA has granted temporary authorization to the plasma of recovering people as an experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not undergone the clinical trials necessary to demonstrate its safety and efficacy for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to manage the epidemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and an identifier.
The application is able to detect “close contacts” using monitoring data and therefore detect a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends auto-quarantine, it also alerts local health authorities. Massive mobile phone data analytics, facial recognition technology, mobile phone location and artificial intelligence are used to locate infected people and people they have been in contact with in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to locate mobile phone data of people suspected of having the coronavirus.
The measure was intended to enforce quarantine and protect people who may have been in contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated phone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, in order to analyze and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect people who are not in quarantine.
In Italy, regional health minister Giulio Gallera said he was informed by mobile operators that “40% of people continue to move.”
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackathon weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid has launched a global call to find creative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
People may suffer from quarantine, travel restrictions, treatment side effects or fear of the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O’Connor as saying, “Increased social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are a perfect cocktail to harm people’s mental health and well-being.”
The disease may have a moderate course with little or no symptoms, resembling other common respiratory diseases such as colds.
Moderate cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases require three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, however data are lacking for COVID-19. In some cases, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severely affected cases, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock, or multivisceral failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, clotting disorders, and cardiac, renal, and liver damage.
Clotting disorders, in particular an increase in prothrombin time, have been reported in 6% of cases hospitalized with COVID-19, with renal impairment observed in 4% of people in this group.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have high levels of liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were spent in hospital.
However, patients transferred to intensive care had an average of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an early case study, the average duration between onset of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total range of between six and 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), men had a 2.8% mortality rate while women had a 1.7% mortality rate.
Histopathological examinations of post-mortem lung samples present diffuse alveolar damage with fibromyxoid cell exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes have been observed in pneumocytes.
The image of the lung resembles an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, cardiac damage due to high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest was observed.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalized people had pre-existing conditions, and the availability of medical resources and socio-economic conditions in a region can also have an impact on mortality.
Estimates of the mortality rate of the disease vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The undercounting of moderate cases may lead to an overestimation of mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of previously contracted cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and had a 2.4 times higher risk of going into intensive care or dying compared to non-smokers. Concerns also emerged about the long-term after-effects of the disease.
The Hong Kong hospital administration has observed a 20% to 30% drop in respiratory capacity in some people cured of the disease, and lung scans suggest organic damage.
This can also lead to post-intensive care syndrome after healing.
In March 2020, it was unknown whether a previous infection provided effective long-term immunity to people cured of the disease.
Immunity is considered likely, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases of people cured of COVID-19 followed by coronavirus-positive tests at a later date have been reported.
These cases are considered an aggravation of a latent infection rather than a re-infection.
It is believed that the virus is natural and of animal origin, by spreading the infection.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost solely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in January 2020 in The Lancet found that the earliest date of onset of symptoms dates back to December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications reported the first onset of symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Several measures are generally used to assess mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, therapeutic options, the time elapsed since the outbreak began, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex and health status.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the emergency pathological codes CIM-10 U07.1 for laboratory-confirmed deaths of SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 infection for deaths of COVID-19 cases diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death to death ratio is 6.9% (153 822/2 240 191) as of April 17, 2020.
Other measures include the rate of lethality (CFR) that reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from the disease and the rate of infectious lethality (IFR) that reflects the percentage of infected people (diagnosed or undiagnosed) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of the contamination at the end of the disease.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can indicate the number of people who have been infected.
In the epicenter of the epidemic in Italy, in Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 of them (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease has spread through festivals, and to young people, resulting in a relatively low mortality rate, and not all COVID-19-related deaths may have been officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system has not been overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of people may have antibodies, according to a blood donor assessment.
69 deaths (0.004% of the population) were confirmed to be related to COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different in both men and women.
Mortality is highest in humans in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The risk is highest among men in their 50s, with the difference between men and women disappearing only at age 90.
In China, the death rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The precise reasons for this difference between the sexes are unknown, but genetics and behavioral factors could be part of it.
Immunological differences by sex, lower prevalence of smoking in women and the development in men of comorbidities such as hypertension at a younger age than in women may have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men and 72% of people who died from COVID-19 were men.
In April 2020, the U.S. government does not collect data related to the gender of COVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women and have an increased risk of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI stands for virus and D stands for disease, with 19 being the first identification of the epidemic: December 31, 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g., China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigma. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called coronavirus 2 linked to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses “COVID-19 virus” and “COVID-19 virus” in its public communication.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as coronaviruses.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were often referred to as "Wuhan coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended the use of the provisional disease names 2019-nCov and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCoV for the virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 directive against the use of places in the names of diseases and viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on February 11, 2020.
Given the capacity limitations of standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers print care equipment such as swabs and respirator parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed an emergency respirator valve and the supplier could not supply it in a timely manner, a local startup redesigned and printed the required 100 valves in one night.
After the initial COVID-19 epidemic, conspiracy theories, false information and misinformation emerged about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and quickly spread online.
It seems that man is able to spread the disease to certain other animals.
Studies have failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines are approved to treat the disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and drugs is currently being conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the “SOLIDARITY trial” to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
There are no vaccines available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use the ACE 2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being researched.
First, researchers are trying to create a whole-virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to provoke a rapid immune response from the human body in the event of a new infection with COVID-19.
A second strategy, subunit-based vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the spicule S protein that helps the virus infiltrate the ACE 2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccination, a new technique for creating vaccination).
Experimental vaccines from all these strategies should be tested in terms of safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied onto the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent activation has been suggested as a potential challenge in the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, but it is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
Seven trials evaluated previously approved malaria treatments, including four studies of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Reconverted antiviral drugs make up the majority of Chinese research, with nine phase III clinical trials on remdesivir in several countries expected in late April.
A dynamic clinical development analysis of candidate vaccines and drugs against COVID-19 was also in place in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are evaluated in the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir associated with interferon beta.
Provisional data suggest the efficacy of remdesivir in March 2020.
Clinical improvements have been observed in patients treated with remdesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, some require independent analysis of the research work.
Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, indicates that double that dose is highly dangerous and could be deadly.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine under an emergency use authorization at the discretion of physicians caring for COVID-19 patients. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for continuation of an in vivo study after demonstrating low-concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial spicule protein initiating using the transmembrane serine 2 protease (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with the ACE 2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine shock can be a complication at later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-shock cytokine properties.Tocilizumab was included in treatment guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study was conducted.
It is currently undergoing non-randomized phase 2 testing at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with a severe form of the disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine shock, it must counteract such evolutions that are suspected to be causing the death of some affected people.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid-refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause, CAR T cells treatment, in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CKD.
The transfer of concentrated and purified antibodies produced by the immune systems of people who have cured COVID-19 to people in need is being studied as a non-vaccine method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for SARS with few conclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mode of action by which passive antibody-based treatment can generate a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibiotic treatment, for example using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
The production of serum from convalescent people, consisting of the liquid part of the blood of healed patients and containing specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased for faster deployment.
