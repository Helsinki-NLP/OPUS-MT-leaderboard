Parliament did not support an amendment to free Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment to the section of the Criminal Code condemning opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the door to the release of the former minister, but parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce penalties for economic crimes in the second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for the alleged signing of a deal with Russia that was disadvantageous to Ukraine over the purchase of natural gas.
The sentence is not yet firm, the appeals court has an obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that it was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West doubts have arisen about the fairness of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code condemning the former prime minister was supported by 147 deputies in the vote.
226 votes were required for approval.
The victory of Libya
The history of the Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no war anymore.
It remains to be determined who is the winner.
As is already customary in the region, Islamists won the elections, but now it’s about elucidating whether it’s moderates or radicals.
The National Transitional Council has brought into force the traditional Sharia law, which we already know in a certain way.
Libya will become a crime-free country, because thieves will be cut off.
Women can already forget to emancipate themselves and apostates waiting for their execution and so on.
Instead of by the person of the dictator, society, composed of warrior tribes, will unite by the Quran.
In Libya, an order will be established that we cannot even imagine and certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best and probably did not suit the Libyans already mentioned.
The truth is that it is not surprising that the Islamic fighters gratefully accepted the help of the unfaithful dogs.
The only justification was that, from his point of view, the NATO attacks were not directed by an American general, but great be Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each of the successful interventions.
When looking for winners in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are caught in a shootout used by Islamists and our politicians to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without any guarantees of profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, the locals do not have a problem expelling the "crusaders"
But, without occupation, will the oil companies get hold of Libyan black gold only with good words?
It is quite possible not to, but it may be that the West can finally boast of protecting human rights.
As long as the followers of Shariah do not cross us.
A New Era of Crisis Begins
France and the rest of Europe go on the hunt for the investor search engine
A statistical whirlwind has spread across Europe
Individual States have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy in the quarter-on-quarter period has stagnated, while France and Germany have grown.
However, the bond market today has broken records.
Investors no longer only focus on Italy, but also on Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates on economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP grew by 0.5%, France’s by 0.4%.
Both countries have made the data for the second quarter public, in Germany it has improved more than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of expected 0.1%), although in France there was a slight reduction of 0.1% (the original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% year-on-year in the third quarter of this year.
However, in the quarter-on-quarter period, gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated and the trend of gradual deceleration in the growth of economic development conforms.
The results are even worse than analysts’ forecasts.
Main events:
Annually, the Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year, but has stagnated quarterly.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to previous and seasonally recalculated data, grew by 0.5%.
The economy of the Eurozone and also of the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, grew by 0.2%, which is in line with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy has fallen by 5.2% year-on-year.
The interest on your 10-year bonds is 28.45%.
Interest on Italian and Spanish bonds has grown to critical limits.
The problematic situation is beginning to affect Austria, Holland, France, Belgium, etc.
Interest on 10-year Czech bonds remains at 4%, although the situation is getting worse in the area.
In Germany, there are voices saying that the ECB should ultimately grant loans.
The Czechs qualify for the Euro.
They won 1:0 and celebrate the classification with a premium of 200 million.
The football team fulfills the most difficult task of the entire season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent ?ech and the brilliant goalkeeper Petr Jira?ek, the victory was given by 1:0.
The Czech team, along with a good dose of luck in the second half, defended itself fantastically from the attacks of the local team, so that it will not miss the appointment of the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed the development of the party in detail in a thorough report.
There was almost no excitement in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the local team towards the end, and also to the excellent game of ?ech and the heroic Jira?ek, won by 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates his pass to the European Championship.
Due to the very correct Czech defense, the Montenegrins did not press until the second half.
The two victims of the party were Damjanovi? and Vu?ini?, who missed two great occasions.
In addition, thanks to the great Petr’ech, the Czech eleven will not miss the appointment of the European Cup, so that the coffers of national football will receive a gratification of approximately 200 million kronor.
It was a good offensive game from the first few minutes.
Both teams were just trying to maintain the lines and played nothing else around the center of the field.
There was no pressure from the local players in the first half, kicks to the other field in defense, just what the Czech defense managed to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
With their gesture they want to express their support for their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students began praying Tuesday at noon outside the facility and then chanted death slogans to the U.S. and Israel.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around the nuclear technology center working with uranium in the Iranian city of Isfahan on Tuesday.
They want to show that they are willing to defend their country’s nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a recent report, found that Iran, by all indications, is striving for nuclear weapons.
In Israel there is talk of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began to pray at noon at the Isfahan nuclear facilities and then launched death slogans against the U.S. and Israel.
In the event of an attack, aimed at crippling Iran’s nuclear program, not only the Isfahan power plant, but also the Natanz facility, where uranium is enriched, would be reached, according to Israeli sources.
Daily menu of an obese child: no breakfast and dinner sausages
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have problems of overweight, where overweight affects 9% of the school population and obesity 5%.
Obese children mostly come from families with an unhealthy lifestyle, current research shows.
It re-demonstrates the importance of the environment where one grows for a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as a reference.
At the table, obsessed children feed on sausages at least twice as often as children from normal weight families.
For dinner, more than 19% of the obese had eaten chips the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program "Obesity is not a coincidence."
In families of overweight children there is no habit of playing sports, which is applicable to most current families, where only 15% of children answered that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
A survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and involved almost 900 children from Basic Education in all of Czechia.
It was already the second edition of the program "Obesity is not a coincidence", which supports the General Health Insurance Company and the company Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 children have participated in the project from the 4th to the 8th year.
A proper diet and enough exercise in the family are determining factors, which significantly decrease the number of children who are overweight and even obese.
“Only half of the children surveyed responded that they have five daily meals depending on the diet: breakfast, lunch, lunch, snack, and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet,” one of the survey results states.
No breakfast but with steak for dinner
Specialists warn that, in a healthy development, details are important, which also count, such as having a fixed time for family breakfast.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23% of school families have breakfast at the same time.
In most families, they each have breakfast alone.
But the worst thing was to find out that in 10% of households nothing is eaten.
Breakfast is, however, the basis of a correct daily diet.
The study shows that families of obese children consume insane chips much more often.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet soft drinks daily (70%).
Generally, more than 40% of the children surveyed do sports, however, among their parents this result is reduced to less than half, only 15%.
Make your diet
The next phase of the study allowed the chosen boys (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
“The food preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15, from the point of view of healthy eating, are far from ideal.”
Among his favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets.
“It’s especially alarming the popularity of sweet soda,” the study’s final report warns.
As a main meal, it takes the pasta palm and closely follows the poultry meat.
Practically, children always reject legumes and the taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Change to healthy habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive the right information.
“In the control group of the study participants, who filled out the questionnaire after completing the prevention program “Obesity is not a coincidence,” a major change was made in favor of the principles of healthy eating.
It is striking, for example, when it comes to soft drinks, where many children would begin to prefer regular water.
Children would also more often choose poultry and fish for the main meal in the questionnaire and restrict the consumption of sweet food and flour derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals
In the introductory article, How Stylists Learn, I already complained a bit that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Lecture by three professionals in the field, how to dress problematic characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the world of entertainment.
And it will be worse.
The closer the final exams are, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it no longer fits a pin.
We have once studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) about how to dress the woman who does not have a perfect symmetry.
And so is the vast majority.
Someone is short-necked, someone has a stylized figure without the proper curves, and someone suffers from overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically soften a wide shoulder, lengthen a neck or recreate the necessary curves
We have been given certain tricks on how to make the body of women of the Jennifer Lopez type stand out, with huge breasts and hips but narrow waist and at the same time not dressing her in a way too challenging
If, for example, the difference between the waist and the hips is so great that the skirt or pants don’t fit, it’s worth getting at least one extra piece of fabric sewn to measure.
They will certainly not regret it, because the clothes you feel perfectly are priceless.
With a tailored skirt you will feel much better than with one that does not stop moving, getting up, dancing at the waist, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to wear clothes with pleats, ornaments, embroidery or draped.
There are certainly many different kinds of information and bodies, so I am glad that I have all week to put all this information in my head.
And even so, I fear that with the task assigned, I already have more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two celebrities, to whom he must design two dressing rooms: one for the day and one for the night.
You have to take into account the current look, the fashion style that suits the person in question.
I've had to dress up Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
I scream inside, for me it is much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who lately will have gained a hundred kilos (please take into account the exaggeration), or the very young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut them out of the magazines or search them on the internet and print them, and then elaborate them graphically.
The moodboard, which is called the complete result, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of styling.
The stylist, therefore, not only dresses physically, but also deals, for example, with product pages in magazines (concrete topics such as trends, bags, coats, etc.).
About all this spoke the stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But all of this is already on Sunday.
The stylist must have a global vision.
The three specialist guests animated Saturday’s conference with information on all types of bodies.
Stylist Honza Pokorn, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Ren.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to take advantage of this.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same garment in different ways.
In this case, variability is essential.
Thus, such a gabardine (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can be dressed in classic jeans and T-shirts, but also serves to dress the naked body with heeled shoes and photograph it as if it were actually a dress.
Or just pull it up and raise your neck to get a totally different picture.
“Play with it,” he insisted.
What I value most is the following advice: "To start working, you need to know all the rules first."
“Then you can break them,” Jakub said.
At last it is clear to me why we memorize all these formulas, what is combined with why, if it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
Not to mention the parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothes in the reservation than he intends to photograph.
So for a fashion story that has ten pages (thus ten outfits), you have to have ready, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And besides that the photos the clothes work in combination with other garments, all of them different from those used in reality.
All this must be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorn assured us that image and style alone are, in many cases, half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the marquetine have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, for the time being, there is no clear trend to use the services of stylists.
Even famous characters find it useless (my skills are enough, my physical appearance is not so important).
And when someone asks us for our services, we must keep in mind that they are very likely to tell us a size very different from your real (minor).
Then just gobble up and find out if the heart magazines have already written about the topic, if a certain celebrity has gained weight/fat, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that it is not enough for the stylist to orient himself in fashion, but he has to understand the outfit.
During your work, you must above all communicate with the people you saw, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, he doesn’t miss them, he defends their opinions.
"When a director hires you to sort out her wardrobe and fill it with nice clothes, you can't just take and throw away everything there was and say, 'Oh, what a horror.'"
“Find at least a couple of things you can think about and recommend for someone to put on,” says Mario.
He also showed us that everything should fit in the so-called "placovka", that is, the work bag.
It is fastened around the waist and has all the necessary tools.
There are also nylon thread (which serves the stylist during the photo shoot of products such as bags or caps), special clipping clips of garments in front, if it was larger (pins and other types of hitches are not allowed, as they could damage the body), or a set of fabric.
In order not to stay in passive listening and put something into practice, we have learned to cover the sole of the shoes.
Even during photo shoots in the studio, on a flat surface, you could damage the sole and much more on the outside.
And we did nothing but cover up and cover up.
We couldn't touch the shoes with scissors so we wouldn't accidentally damage them.
So you had to be very skillful.
Mario has given me a joy to praise my work without reservation.
The truth is, I don't get those skills very well.
This is just a small part of everything we’ve heard all weekend, in the second part of the course.
I’ve already realized that dedicating myself to styling at a professional level is not a path of roses, but it gives me exactly what people say.
In Need for Speed: The Run you compete all over America.
Review
A journey, at first unconcerned, is complicated by a series of improper carelessness of a routine trip during tomorrow's shift.
To some extent it was possible to meet expectations, but this is useless, if, in fact, nothing extraordinary was intended to be done.
The new installment, to which the title is added The Run, raised high expectations already before its premiere.
He promised to give new air to the old Need for Speed racing saga and, in the wake of what has been shown, it appears as a game that should not end up being an action genre again.
We are also curious about how the inserted scenes would look, where the main character gets out of the car and walks on his own foot.
As is often the case in NFS series, the results don’t vary much from what we expected.
There are races that can be considered acceptable, but in total count points are lost due to absurd failures, which have already been appearing in the series for years.
In reality, they cannot even be called errors, but rather it is the incomprehensible disappointment of programmers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are introduced to a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, he is offered to participate in an illegal race all over America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco, and your mission is to get to New York first.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then more than fifty races.
It follows that each race takes place on a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
In this way, one does not even remotely have the feeling that the game always offers the same thing.
Some of the environments are even pleasing to the eye, although the technical level of the chart is equivalent to that of previous installments in the series.
Therefore, it is nothing of the other world.
But the desert walk, the autumn landscape or the high snow-covered mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, races are diversified from time to time by an atypical element.
Thus, for example, in the desert you find a sandstorm that decreases visibility.
In the mountains, be careful that you are not buried in a flood.
According to that, each of the races is very well developed.
There are only a couple of models, but that’s enough.
For a moment, you try to overtake a required number of rivals (normal in a classic race), then you try to gain time (timed classic duel) and then you are waiting for a duel against a single opponent.
In the midst of all this the police sometimes appear, which only makes things even more difficult.
The novelty is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape from someone and you have to help him, always pressing the button just at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It’s surprising, though, that there’s a lot less scenery in the game than you’d expect (specifically there are only three).
But the end result is positive, because this element does not become annoying and, in the context already mentioned, it is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of previous episodes.
That means it’s no longer a big deal, but it can’t be said to be bad.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you can look elsewhere.
But a race conceived with enough action is quite suitable for this style of driving, although we can find something better among the games of the competition.
So far, all in order.
Problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the correct driving models, collisions are no longer the same.
From such games you can not expect to recreate deformations and complicated collisions, but in fact before a hit against any object, you can not predict how your car will react, so not everything is in order.
It is typical that, by making a very tight overtaking or circulating the car with normal traffic, there are only slight rocks, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up making uncontrolled pirouettes.
Or even completely destroyed.
Thanks to the reset system, no big problems arise, but it can put you in a bad mood.
Resets are scheduled in such a way that when you suffer an accident or leave the track, the game returns you to the last rescue point on the track.
However, only five resets are available in each race.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it’s just a help in case something goes wrong, but it’s not very trustworthy.
Sometimes, even resetting doesn’t help, it just helps to learn the given stage of memory.
A big disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, you have to enter in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Other times you find yourself somewhere "civil" vehicles always with the same configuration, although you are the first, fifth or arrive five minutes before or after.
This makes you angry especially in situations, when you see that two cars that go to meet in opposite directions, your opponent advances without problems, but when you arrive, you must turn or brake.
It’s the same when you arrive, because it’s programmed because “surprise” will always happen in front of your noses.
The opponents also have one more advantage.
Throughout the game you will arrive at places where, regardless of the moment, the same opponent will always advance you in the same place.
This also happens at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must come before you, at whatever price.
When it goes in front of you, it makes it difficult for you to see the cars that come in front, so at first you can pop the car.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that it will surely disappoint you right away.
And it’s a shame, because although the model of the trip is simple, the game is fun and action-packed, so it’s often not possible to follow in detail what happens or where.
And it really doesn’t matter if the merit takes the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or qualifying in the race so it doesn’t fit the boredom, or anything else.
An unusual idea is the change of cars during races.
You have to be attentive to the gasoline suppliers next to the road, because right there you have to change cars, although in the vast majority of cases you will have enough of what you have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for urban areas, American strong cars for straight highways and exotic super sports cars for technical driving, for example, on mountain roads with curves.
In addition to the main narrative thread there is also a parallel thread of challenges, that is, there are races in specific places that you will know by the stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also experience points for your profile, which serves both challenges and stories.
Upon reaching the top level, the driver is given several possibilities, starting with the car and ending with funds for the profile.
At the same time, an online Autolog feature is connected, which compares your results with those of other players and makes other community features available.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last race in history is made.
With the car you get to the subway tunnel (pass), where you start to run in the dark on the tracks (pass).
The speedometer marks you between 150 and 200 km/h (pass) and suddenly, from behind you arrives the subway convoy and you are taken in front of nothing else.
In the writing we will surely have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game nobody even thought a little or if the real authors take us for a panda of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the overall visual effects are in most cases enjoyable, sometimes even superb.
What a pity that, in the most tense moments, the image quality is reduced and, sometimes, in a serious way.
This especially affects accidents where many participants are involved, when the continuous image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to please most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "each of his father and mother", but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game just for his music.
The final feel of Need for Speed: The Run is pretty confusing.
If the game avoided absolutely silly mistakes, we would have trouble saying that The Run is the best NFS game of recent years.
It gives the feeling that the game is not over.
The fun is guaranteed, but be prepared because mistakes will hit you in the eyes with the force of airport reflectors.

The Ambassador to the EU, Vicenza:
The Czechs have a reputation as negativists and eurosceptics.
“The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions.”
“I didn’t expect a war without a barracks.”
"It will take five, six years before the situation stabilizes a little, calms down and new players get used to their new roles," Czech Ambassador to the EU Milena Vicenová began her conference at the Faculty of Law with conviction.
How not to take seriously his motto "clearly and openly about Europe", which he said in the first part of his lecture, when he managed to describe each EU body and its relations with such precision and clarity, as it would be the envy of many lecturers from the U. Carolina Law School.
Vicenová also considered the work of the new permanent president of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
“First comes the criticism, that if he is insulting, a gray official, able to assume any role, but I must say that he left everyone bewildered, because he assumes his roles perfectly.”
"He is a man who knows how to listen to the members of the 27 states, communicate with them and has a very clear vision of where the EU should go."
The new position of Foreign and Security Policy representative is explained from the question: "Who is this EU, what number can I call it?", which is an important step towards the unification and clarification of the political union facing states such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us from Olomouc cheese.
Vicenová has also taken care of the agenda for the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency two years ago was a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging economic crisis, solved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at the time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU has many commitments at the moment.
In the words of the ambassador: "a good riot", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is being discussed now.
On the other hand, the EU’s seven-year budget, caused by the current much more complicated economic situation, must be approved.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will have priority, which countries will receive more support and which less? That is something that will be present on the agenda of the next meeting.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she arrived in Europe: "About Europe clearly".
“The truth is, I don’t like ugly abbreviations, foreigners or jargon that people don’t understand.”
"How can a citizen understand that in Brussels cucumbers are not really invented curved or round cucumbers, bananas of various sizes or that no one is going to ban us from Olomouc cheese?"
It also aims to make more use of the EU environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to the European institutions.
The Europe of Speeds is waiting for us.
According to the ambassador, the Czechs are reputed to be Eurosceptics and people perceive the negatives rather than the positives.
He also regretted the low participation of the Czechs in the European institutions.
Many factors are to blame, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational messages, but also the little support of the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech presidency, he highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
“Believe me, when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak approaches me, a Frenchman next to me says, ‘What, are you from the Visegrad Group left?’ and it turns out that it doesn’t make him any fun.”
In the future, the EU, according to Vicenová, is awaiting tough new rules on budgetary policy for the Member States.
It is perceived as something very real of the concept of the two speeds, if not more, in Europe, more than the new "European Federation".
“We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone.”
“We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure.”
“It was said for the first time that only countries that want to cooperate and those that don’t, should stay out.”
"These procedures will be more and more and will strengthen the Europe of the two speeds," Vicenová is expected.
In this regard, he also highlighted the role of the Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle, according to which all issues affecting the whole of the EU should be discussed among member states, not just among members of the Eurozone.
Brand story:
The innovative IBM begins its second century of existence
If someone were to search for a term that would define IBM’s strategy with great precision, the most approximate would be “long-term.”
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and yet it has been a hundred years since its foundation.
The basis for this long-standing character was laid by the firm’s first chief, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He coined the motto that many of the world’s problems have a solution if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" became his hallmark, around which the future giant's life will be built (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the foundation of a carefully crafted corporate culture.
“For us, IBM involves long-term thinking, a continuous movement toward the future.
IBM has survived and thrived for a hundred years for that reason, because it remained true to its core principles, but without fear of the changes around it.
That has enabled us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We look forward to further prospering in our second century,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company’s current director, during his anniversary.
A sophisticated system
Watson, as early as the 1930s, cared about the care of his employees as the businessman from Ba?a in the Czech Republic (IBM employees were among the first U.S. workers to enjoy paid vacations, insurance, stylish uniforms, and a sophisticated pay system that rewarded the best inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication is maintained by IBM in the customer relationship.
Right from the start, the company was able to discover talent (being one of the first companies in the world to end any type of discrimination, it could choose without problems).
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is the current plan of IBM, by which Palmisano will replace it next year a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She has been working for 30 years at IBM, where she has been head of sales, marketing and strategy.
Over the past few years IBM has participated in so-called virtual meetings, online brainstorming, from which a multitude of future strategies and innovations emerge.
It is not surprising that there are ideas, as almost half a million people work in the firm.
An institution with a good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
“From the beginning, IBM maintained a concept of an institution rather than a technology company,” says Harvard Business School economist and author of the IBM book Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for technology users,” says George Colony of Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the business and directly creating a business.
IBM – or the “Great Green” – as it is known in the U.S. familiarly because of its logo, has become in the last hundred years one of the largest companies in the world.
It is arguably the most versatile technology company (develops both equipment and programs, infrastructure and web hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It holds the highest number of patents of all American technology companies and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Among his inventions are ATMs, payment cards, financial swaps, barcodes and floppy disks.
IBM is set to turnover $220 billion this year, making it the second largest technology company by market capitalization (the first being Apple), when it first outperformed Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the Future
Not all products and innovations just satisfied the taste of customers and the moment (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, OS/2, Prodigy online services or IBM PCjr computers).
“If your business is based on moving forward, you can’t anchor emotionally in the past,” Palmisano said.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its bases on other platforms (and equally, if they don’t work, it abandons them).
And that’s the difference from the competition, Microsoft, which is basically maintained and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Technology of the future
In terms of sales, IBM is mainly dedicated to services, of which about one-fifth are programs and another fifth equipment.
However, even in 1990, the teams accounted for more than half of the supplier share.
As of 2000, IBM has sold low-yield assets totaling $15 billion and invested $58 billion in future technology purchases over the same period.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the modern global financial crisis first manifested itself.
IBM operates on the premises of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of 29 increased investments.
So far, IBM has managed to overcome the crisis.
The value of IBM’s stock since the beginning of 2008 has risen stratospheric to 120%, the company’s net profit has continued to rise.
IBM’s currency is to change everything except its value.
One can therefore hope that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will endure.
IBM History: From Cheese Cutter to Space Flight
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York one hundred years ago, being its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was adopted as early as 1924 - originally it was a brand used in branches in Canada and South America.
The foundation that gave birth to IBM stems from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
It had inventions such as the famous "signing clock", which allows to control the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also presided over his supervisory board.
Flint signed the head of a competition company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him with the management of the company.
The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM (Watson’s ideas remain the firm foundation on which corporate culture and identity are based).
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began with the production and sale of all kinds of business appliances, from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During the first four years that Watson ran the company, revenue doubled by $9 million and began the company’s large expansion across continents.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, after almost forty years occupying the chair of the boss, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM staff and computers helped NASA guide flights to space (to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "pécés", which established the standard of computers of the time, came to market as the IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, for its part, acquired the consulting part of the company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began offering comprehensive advice and services with high added value.
The strategy IBM has paid for over the past three years is the Smarter Planet concept.
Its aim is to make more rational use of technology, although areas have not yet been planned and circumstances have not been improved, for example, in relation to transport and city management.
For the commerce sector, IBM recently unveiled the “Smart Commerce” platform that allows retailers to manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
In 1932 he opened a branch in Czechoslovakia, the first country to have it in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM’R also operates the strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe has is in Prague. Also here there is a world-renowned research team that works with voice recognition.
Rychtáová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, stay with that donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtáová (53) said it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtá (53) had become the sole protector of Iveta Bartoșová (45), but also her lover, Darina remained hopeful that Josef would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
However, he will no longer wait and has set clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can come home, but not like my partner anymore," Rychtáová said.
When Darina Rychtá-ová welcomed Barto-ové into her home during the summer, she couldn’t even imagine how her marriage would end.
Despite the request, Iveta hadn't moved thirty days later and Pepe hadn't left the singer.
He even publicly stated that he loved her.
Eventually, Darina resigned, apparently accepted her husband’s relationship and even bid him farewell forever.
Rychyta doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
If he ever broke up with Barto-ová, his wife would not wait for him at home with open arms.
He is the biological father of my children and if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will throw him out.”
“But here I would live no longer as my dear old fool who was wrong, but as a man to whom I am bound by certain ties,” Rychtáová said, adding that she had already disengaged from her husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Josef doesn’t mind if his wife closes the back door.
“I accept my wife’s decision.”
"I'll be with Iveta and there's no change possible."
“My wife set this up as a marriage on paper and I respect it.”
“The company is still in place, I make the home arrangements, I take care of the garden, the home, I make the purchases.”
“Darina and I talk to each other normally, the only thing is that we don’t share a bed,” said Rychta.
If Rychtáová found a new love, he would not object.
“We don’t sleep together and she doesn’t interest me, or where she’s going or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it’s my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility,” concludes Josef.
Women’s Worst Vices: Are They Also Referring to You?
If you ask men to be able to cite some typical vices of women, in general each of them will name them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize yourselves in the following lines, where certain feminine vices are cited that manage to boil the blood of men?
Go shopping
Do you blame your half-orange who is dependent on purchases?
Do you have to buy at least one meal a week?
Do you like to shop often at sales?
Then in your case you can say that shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that they should appease their passion for shopping, at least a little.
But what woman could resist the temptation to just walk through the clothing stores, look for tight clothes and then try them all in the tester (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for most women shopping is a hobby, for men it can become practically hell.
Just remember how many times you’ve told your partner you’d better wait outside the door.
Constant dissatisfaction
“Am I not too fat?”
"I would need to lose at least five pounds - should I start exercising?"
"Do you really like it?"
Don't these phrases sound to you?
Oh, yeah?
So she's one of those women obsessed with her looks.
It’s not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to hearing their partner complain all the time about their physical appearance.
Strong sex also agrees that the more the frequency of complaints increases, the more annoying women become.
Cleanliness and order first
It's like an infinite wolf.
Clean the windows, vacuum, scrub the floor, remove dust, scrub the bathtub and all that at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner for stepping on the clean floor with a dirty foot, your children for soiling a newly cleaned washbasin and a shelf with glass doors that was so hard for you to clean?
In case you suffer from this “deviation”, try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should surely not occupy a primary place in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness could threaten your relationships and family well-being.
Making Unpleasant Comments
"Dressed panties are left with dirty clothes."
"You want to wear those used socks tomorrow, too."
"The wet cloth is not left on the floor!"
If you make those comments to your partner more times a day, know that this way you will get him out of your boxes.
Of course. You don't want to say anything wrong, you just want to get everything in order.
Perhaps, if men knew this, women, for their part, would not make as many comments.
Defamation and gossip
Some women also have slander, gossip, but also offenses and conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, which is why they like to talk together about who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us sometimes gets away with a little harmless gossip.
With the hand in the heart, this is typical of almost every woman.
On the other hand, there are gossipy women who are not controlled, who love to gossip and often do, who despise everyone and are dangerous to those around them, especially in a women’s work team.
Jágr and Vorácek helped with their assists to beat Philadelphia
Hockey striker Jaromír Jágr participated Monday in the NHL match with two assists who brought the victory over Philadelphia 5:3 on the Carolina court and again put Czech players at the forefront of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux took advantage of the 39-year-old's play, and took one step further and was declared the game's best player.
He was awarded two assists in the match and also Jágr's partner, Jakub Vorák.
After the meeting, Jágr told overseas journalists that Giroux had predicted a great night.
"Before the match I told him I would triple."
“I presented it.”
“Sometimes they seem ambushed,” Jágr explained, after his performance gave Giroux a goal, in the wake of the Flyers’ first setback.
A while later, the team’s second intervention also had a Czech trail.
Vorahek made the record behind the Hurricanes goal and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, who scored a goal.
A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was kicked out, but from the start of the second half they already dominated the Flyers.
Specifically for Giroux.
After collaborating with Jágr he scored the third goal, after his shot slid into the quarter of Wayne Simmonds' goal.
“I love playing with him.”
“I don’t want to say he’s the best player on the court, but he’s certainly in the top three,” Jágr said.
“It would never have occurred to me that at the end of my career I was going to play with an athlete like him.”
“I’m very satisfied with that.”
“I want to play for him.”
All these years in the NHL, my teammates played for me, and that now produces results,” adds Jágr.
Carolina still turned the game into a drama, with Tuom Ruutu's goal and then Dwyer's again, penalizing, until he got a goal away.
Matt Read did not allow any further complications, although they ended up outnumbered by two to one.
"Pronger had a good performance in our field."
"He cleared the record, I took speed and Read went to the farthest side."
“I tried to tie him to the record and I’m happy because I got it,” Vorák described the last goal of the match as he lived it.
With its victory, Philadelphia has taken the lead in the Eastern Conference.
Montreal’s Czech defender, Jaroslav ?pa?ek, did not play until the end of the game against Buffalo, in the second third he retired due to an upper body injury.
The Canadiens not only lost a player with a lot of defense experience, but also by a difference of two goals, 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec was unable to take advantage of one of the shots.
More than the points lost to the local coach regretted the large number of injured in the last row, and play the game only with five defenses.
"That's bad."
“We played the game only with one veteran player, the rest were novices.”
"Finally, but it's that you can't do anything about it, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
“So much so that rotating the players turned against us, we couldn’t resist it.”
“We had to further simplify the game, take the record off our field.”
“And so we leave gaps,” explained one of the defenders, P. K. Subban.
Goalkeeper Ondej Pavelec contributed thirty Winnipeg interventions in the 5:2 win over Tampa Bay.
Jets' goals were scored by five players who ended a series of defeats that had already lasted five games.
How Travel Prices Have Evolved Since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorized state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia at the time: ?edok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at the time mostly sold trips only to the socialist bloc, as travel to the West was very restricted.
Czech tourists therefore went on vacation to the beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union, (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when one could travel to Yugoslavia, however, after the Yugoslav regime leaned westward and travel by Czech tourists was then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also the Czechoslovakians) were not allowed to travel freely and individually even through the socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, otherwise the individual trip was not possible.
Travel agencies also offered trips to the West at the time, but one had to queue up with a sleeping bag and spend the night like that, or have "good acquaintances" at the agency.
Still not everything was won.
The so-called “promise of change” that was the condition for travel to the West, was not granted to the “politically unreliable people”, who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without exchange guarantees, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of the Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so there were a large number of cottages and summer houses, which the Czechs acquired.
The Czech way of travelling has undergone a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 for us it was no longer going to spend the holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million vacation trips to countries around the world.
It turns out in a great paradox, which we are no longer aware of today, the fact that at the currently favorite destination, Croatia, until 1989 you could not travel freely, because it was part of Yugoslavia then.
In the early 1990s, visa waivers were imposed for travel to neighbouring Western European states, prompting a huge surge of short-term visits, mostly to Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks, for a long time, did not see enough of the excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris groups of Czechs slept in parks in tents, as our income from that time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or pension.
A typical characteristic of the Czechs of that time was to take food (canned, sausages, etc.) with them to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so that our tourists could finally, after decades, freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living was rising and with it also the average wages, which around 1997 caused an increase in the demand for travel.
With the increase in demand for travel agencies began, starting in 1997, regularly, to prepare trips using the connections of charter flights, which made travel prices incredibly lower compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts for the volume of passengers.
In the late 1990s, Czechs were already traveling visa-free to almost all developed countries except the US, which further simplified our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism happened as early as 2000, when the first direct flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country was organized, thanks to a huge demand, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, direct charter flights with Czech tourists to distant and hot countries depart every year. This winter will fly directly from Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries currently visit about 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this era, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. eliminated visas for Czech tourists, making our country among the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008 the Czechs, for the first time in their history, spent more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, they spent more than 15,000 Czech kronor per head, including on-site expenses.
Ordinary General Assembly convened to elect the president, who could end up deadlocked again.
For almost five months, Czech football has been without a president and it is likely that the successor of Ivan Hasek as President of the Czech Football Federation (FAO) will not be known even after the convening of the next Extraordinary General Assembly that will take place this Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, no agreement has yet been reached on the voting rules to be followed.
Without them, you will not even be able to vote among the three candidates.
Interested in presiding over Czech football are Jind?ich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tom? Paclík.
He resigned in June not without first summoning his colleagues for the purpose of finding a strong person who knew how to take care of football in the future.
However, after the conclusion of the Hasek era, a controversy arose between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was evident on September 16 when the new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain in the National House (Národní d?m), located in the Prague neighborhood of Smíchov, because the talks had been blocked and not only as to the method of election.
There was no consensus on who was entitled to vote in the General Assembly - only the legal representatives or also the delegates with full powers.
From that moment on, and because of this one point, there was a partial agreement, also supported by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation by full powers is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
More light on the situation could no longer shed on the Executive Committee, which, in its meetings, ordinary or extraordinary, basically solved nothing.
Opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the nerve point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the third round to avoid the deadlock?
"The dispute revolves around whether to proceed according to the statutes or find another model," says Du?an Svoboda, one of the three vice presidents of FA?R, who, from the association's management, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round the candidate will win the highest percentage of support in the federation to which he will submit his candidacy.
The Region of Moravia is ready to reach a compromise so that it can win that candidate with a higher percentage of total votes in both federations.
The bohemian part, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, must have a majority of at least two-thirds.
"This would, however, take away the meaning of the previous two rounds and completely deny the concept of the bicameral system," Svoboda understands the Moorish side's objections, according to which it would be best not to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
With that said, surprisingly, he also agrees with Toma-Paclík, although the electoral regulations established by the statutes of all candidates are supposed to be more suitable for Pelta.
“I would like it to be voted on as much as possible in accordance with the statutes.”
"So that no nonsense is invented about the representatives as in the last General Assembly," says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who first ran as a candidate and who directs his remarks mainly against Pelta.
Pelta is optimistic.
According to him, Nymburk will decide on the new president and he believes the candidates in the future will cooperate in a constructive way.
“All the passions will be appeased with today’s match of our national team in the European Championship.
"Football will once again be the protagonist, and so we will cooperate more comfortably," says the representative of Jablonice, who of the three candidates has more experience in football management, both professionally and regionally.
Rajchl is the most reluctant.
“I hope an agreement is reached, but unfortunately the situation is much more complicated.”
“It’s not about the conflict between Bohemians and Moravians, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience.”
“This could result in a new blockade of the General Assembly.”
“Anyway, I hope common sense will be imposed,” Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be held in Montenegro, but who can know until the game starts if the football team will be complete?
The special plane, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, among others Vice Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not left this morning due to technical problems in Prague, having to look for an alternative to transport part of the executive committee to the place where the qualifying match will take place.
Perhaps the decisive meeting, at last, could be the one that will take place at ministerial level, which they say will be held this Wednesday.
Education, Youth and Sports Minister Josef Dobec would very much like to incorporate the divided parties into the most powerful sports organization in the country for an agreement to be reached.
There is much at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the upcoming General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Federation of Sport (STV) that will try to give Czech sport a new direction following the financial problems of the Sazka lottery house.
Paclík will fight for the presidency because he can’t find a more suitable candidate.
If Pilsen’s head of footballers, Tomas Paclik, knew before the extraordinary General Assembly the name of a suitable candidate who would satisfy all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Federation (FAO), he would not even stand as a candidate for such a relevant position.
“If there was a right person, I would be fighting for her and not running for election.”
“But to this day we haven’t been able to find a person like that,” Paclik told the Czech News Agency.
What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the supposed winner of the elections, which paves the way for the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FAOR).
Paclík also points out that, should he win, he would remain in office as president only until 2013, when the turn of the ordinary general assembly would come.
In that role he would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too related to football events.
“I’ve already talked to some people I could consider.”
“It was crazy for me to hear some say they don’t even want to identify with Czech football right now.”
“I’d like to change that view,” he adds.
What is supposed to bother Paclík most right now is Pelta’s relationship with Pilsen Regional Football Association President Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates in the general assembly.
For Paclík it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the presidential chair.
"If he wins, the current status will remain and nothing in football will change."
“With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, football will bring even less profit,” Paclík said.
It also mentions the fact that a few years ago the name Pelta was associated with a wiretapping during the investigation of a corruption case, from which Pelta emerged unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige football could bring Pelta's victory."
“And with what eyes will UEFA and FIFA look at us,” said Paclík, who also takes with some caution his previous statement that “the Pilsen Club would sell if Pelta became president.”
In the event of winning Thursday’s election, Paclík could consider cooperating with Pelta in the future.
The same is true of the other candidate, Rajchl, who has been supported by Paclík before the September General Assembly that ended in a fiasco.
“He (Pelta) would be the first to follow.”
"It's very capable."
“I could imagine, for example, as head of the representation.”
"but not as a manager of an association."
"I also don't put my nose where I don't feel capable," added Paclík, who in September garnered much attention for supporting the suspension of the Arbitration Commission chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits that he would dare to manage the association.
Since last summer he is also the Director of Pilsen, which with his support celebrated in May the triumph in the first division.
“I have the strength to change some things in the football field and contribute to their safe practice.”
"To reduce the influence of some lobbying groups, they probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeals committee, producing unpleasant situations," Paclik said without hiding his antipathies towards Sparta president Daniel K?etínsk?.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between FAOR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it exerted pressure on political leaders to allocate more money to the sport than the lottery taxes.
“It’s one of the key issues that the new president should be dedicated to.”
“If they raise taxes on gambling, as political parties advertise, they would support their arguments, but, frankly, they have to tell us where all this money is going to go,” he says.
In addition, Paclík now does not even take into account his association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself claims that the President of the FAOR must be "non-partisan".
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla from Prague.
"It's not ideal."
“But I don’t see any sense in hypocritically ceding my shares of the Pilsen Club to someone else and then going back there after a year and a half,” Paclik said.
Pelta promised FAOR new statutes that would end the deadlock in the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if elected, he would ensure that FAOR had new statutes that would serve definitively to resolve, in the future, disputes regarding the electoral regulations.
The Jablonec representative is optimistic about Thursday's meeting in Nymburk, and believes the pre-election conflict could move toward a solution today with the football team's possible victory.
Already before the elections that were not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, if elected, precisely on representation and fundraising.
He decided to participate at the last minute in the last general assembly, so this two-month delay could do him good to defend and present, in a broader context, his ideas on football management.
“People at all levels have been involved in football for a long time and look forward to meeting the new president on Thursday.”
“They feel like it’s time for someone to run the association,” thinks the man who primarily partners with the Jablonice Club, but who worked at Sparta and the Association’s executive committee.
For this reason, he believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately, at the June General Assembly statutes were passed that were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president since September," Pelta said.
Exactly the re-adaptation of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a lure to win over the delegates.
“If I’m elected president, I’ll take it as a personal challenge and I’m willing to respond if this fails.”
“It’s a matter of principles, without which we can’t exist,” says Pelta.
Moreover, in theory, he tries not to interfere with his opponents.
Already in the past he had warned that he was collaborating with Henry Rajchl, whom he respects for his training in Law, being aware that his opponent would also be his first vice president.
He had not attacked Thomas Paclík for a long time, who, unlike Pelta, left no puppet head.
"He's been in the football world for over a year, and he's already achieved some successes."
"His attacks were embarrassing and many people were surprised by the election campaign."
“That’s why many of them doubt their true character,” he told his opponent Pelta, who remains faithful to the statements announced as early as September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from the lowest to the highest competitions.
The latter should be a showcase for football promotion.
“I would also try to solve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result of last year’s corruption scandal.”
"Immediately afterwards I would get involved in negotiations with the public and private sectors, to ensure that there is enough money for all the football," the 46-year-old said two months ago.
He also promised that his appointment as president of football would not entail any personal modification of the squad.
“I would have to know the tasks of each employee first,” he said, referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, understandable nervousness prevails.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios looming ahead of the upcoming general assembly, he believes the delegates will not travel in vain this Thursday to Nymburk.
“If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, we will certainly be able to overcome it.
“Football needs credibility, which will only recover if it finally has a leader,” Pelta said.
Rajchl promises, under his leadership, that FAOR would begin to work eagerly.
If the current Vice President Jindrich Rajchl were elected as the new President of the Czech Football Association, many people would surely be resentful.
Rajchl promises that, if elected, he would work hard.
He wants to implement systematic change and make the members of the executive committee responsible for each area of football individually.
He is also committed to resolving the Bohemians’ case, improving relations with UEFA and FIFA, getting more money for football and continuing the work begun by former president Ivan Hasek.
“As president, I would like to dedicate myself completely to football.”
“From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to the national team, to professional football or the training of young high-performing footballers.”
“By this I don’t mean I would do it all by myself,” Rajchl said in an interview with the TK.
“I’m a team player and I want to divide the executive committee’s competencies in such a way that each member can engage in a specific area.”
"And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of those segments, move forward with a lot of momentum."
"A lot of people probably won't like this, because it will mean starting to work very hard and not just criticizing the work of others," he added.
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, it is said that it has considered the possibility of not running again as a candidate.
“Everyone knows, I work 20 hours a day.”
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will stop me and hinder every step of the way," he said.
“A lot of people have told me that I shouldn’t give up, because then others would give up too.”
“It’s about having faith so you don’t give up like that, no more,” he said.
According to them, he is also motivated to continue the work he has already started with Hasek.
“During those two years, a lot of the work was done that I don’t want to be missed now.”
"There are processes that have been started and that will have their effect in a couple of years and I would not like someone to stop them," he said, worried that if they chose the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could be as it was before the time of Hasek.
"I believe in order, and it's something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain.
“Behind him are all those people who would take care of football so that it was just a privilege for a few elected officials.”
“I can be reproached for a lot of things, but not the fact that I’m in favor of someone.”
"I try to be objective."
“I want to make football for everyone, because that’s the only way everyone will feel good and not just the chosen ones,” Rajchl said.
He also rejects the idea that only the president would be bohemian.
“Although some people try to claim otherwise, I have in mind to do my best for Moravia.”
“For example, it’s time to think about dividing the second division into a Czech part and a Morava part, whose winners would go into the first division.”
“You wouldn’t have the current situation where we only have three Moravian teams, which is a problem for young Moravian players,” Rajchl said.
Although the presidential election has been contested by Tomas Paclík, president of the Pilsner Club, Rajchl continues to believe in his chances of being elected.
“I still feel strong support from the Czech Federation, which chose me as its vice president and knows that behind me there are clear successes,” said Rajchl, whose successes include saving a few tens of millions of kroner from disadvantaged contracts, TV contract negotiations and negotiations on lottery law.
On the other hand, he acknowledges his share of the blame that the federation is not united.
And while he claims Pelta is “disqualified to regain confidence in Czech football,” he sees the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who does have something to offer football.
“No one can deny that he did a great job for Pilsen that year.”
"In case he is elected, he will probably follow what has already begun Ivan Ha'ek and would not significantly change the staffing staff on the committees."
“I don’t want to use that in my favor,” he said to rivals Rajchl.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump to Blue
by Julia Stanek
Swimming pools from an incredible perspective, sumptuous baths in Budapest: Those who visit Europe can experience its blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their tired legs in bubbling baths.
A book shows where the best well-being is found in the water.
When Iris Meder made a research trip over the past year and a half, there was something she couldn’t miss in her luggage, a swimsuit.
Lying with her back on the water, she looked up at the artistic dome, swam towards the marble angels, who were waiting for her on the edge of the pool and marveled at the meticulously restored modernist indoor pool.
He liked the bathroom, taking note in his notebook at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
Architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 pools in this way and presents them in her recent book "Badefreiheiten": the indoor pools in Munich, the historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, the "concrete constructions" in Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and one city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This 46-year-old German woman is a true enthusiast of bathing culture.
He doesn’t want to have anything to do with the sport, says Meder, only the water is different.
It only bothers you that bathroom fans have to settle for blue tiles and chlorine stench, while running fans can breathe in the fascinating scent of spruce forests or hear the cheerful trinkets of birds in the park.
“One day I wondered why swimming pools have to always be so ugly,” she says.
"I started collecting nice pools."
The surface of the water duplicates the architecture.
The spatter in the pool and the ethereal oils in the sauna, the wellness factor in the pools is so great because all the senses are catered for, according to Meder.
And if the builder struggles, indoor pools can be a real gift to the view: "Instead of flooring, in the bathrooms you have a surface of water."
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is folded optically: the high vaults, the colored tiles, the trampolines.
The book with small-format photographs "Badefreiheitn" provides in 190 pages very interesting data on architecture and art history in the historical oases of well-being, but mainly, it makes you want to jump to the blue.
Meder, the pool collector, discovers the outstanding specimens in her research in Hungary.
Next to the magnificent medicinal baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, are the water with nitrates in a unique karst cavity (baths in cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as a few baths, whose pools are alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Many open-air swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city lays eyes on Zurich’s rooftop pool, you can look at snow-covered Arlberb from the outdoor swimming pool of a bath in St. Anton, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which you can observe the practice on the ski slopes.
The perhaps most extraordinary design awaits customers in Längenfeld: Ötztal’s water cathedral looks like a UFO just landed in the Alps.
From three open springs steam rises in winter, while in the background the Ötztal mountains rise in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the pool collector, did not invade the smell of chlorine in every pool.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, in the Arpád baths in Békescsaba, Hungary, the diesel plague is so strong that people believe they have reached a sanitary bath.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters that contain bicarbonate and alkali and whose legume sticks to the skin when entering the pool, a wellness enjoyment in a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in one place in her search for beautiful bathing spots, when she wanted to visit open-air swimming pools and sunbathing in the Czech bath of Luhatschowitz, she came across blocked ground.
The 1902 bathroom of architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the crumbled windows of the red, white and yellow modernist building, he saw the weeds growing between the tiles.
Decadence counteracted in a charming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These baths have three phases of construction behind them; not only can Neo-Romanesque elements from the time of their construction in 1844, but also an Arab hall in Alhambra style, added in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite bath of pool collector, Iris Meder, and not just because it is native to the Black Forest.
“It has a lot of merit to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit,” says Meder.
In such a palace the immersion in the thermal pool apparently does not matter much.
Agricultural Speculation
Deutsche Bank analyzes the commodity business
by Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank Resign Its Agricultural Commodity Business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to check the consequences of speculation for the world’s poor.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, it is clear, according to one study, that 84 percent of Germans do not find it acceptable for banks to speculate with agricultural commodities such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents claim that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions are withdrawing from this business because it intensifies the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that bets on global commodity exchanges drive up prices, and banks bear responsibility for the world’s hunger problem.
The consumer campaign specifically targets Josef Ackermann, director of Deutsche Bank, although big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were thought to protect traders from price swings.
Leading experts agree that players have decoupled from offers and demands, and they profit from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to criticism differently than U.S. competitors: He promised to review the claims and said no business "deserves to compromise the good reputation of Deutsche Bank."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the claims of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis is due to be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank board of directors, along with a recommendation on how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the bank’s management will report on the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the business of raw materials, or even their total abandonment.
Ackermann tries to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, welcomed the news, but reiterated his criticism of the financial sector: "Bets on rising food prices show in a particularly drastic way how ruthless banks are currently harming the public welfare."
Ackermann stands as the biggest bank lobbyist, especially in bonds.
“Deutsche Bank must nullify all investments in its portfolio that put money at stake for food price bets,” Bode said.
“It doesn’t matter if Ackermann deals with the topic of hungry people or the fame of Deutsche Bank.”
Ackermann’s inspection is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the consortium chief wants to offer a perfect picture a few months before leaving his post.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank published that the chairman of the board of directors will change something different from the unplanned on the board of directors.
With the abandonment of controversial agrarian speculation you can perfect your image.
And he needs you to barely care about possible losses, that’s what his successor will take care of.
Two-thirds would cancel investment in raw materials
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on November 7 and 8.
Only 10 percent considered it legitimate for the Deutsche Bank to offer investments that bet on food prices.
Many customers of the bank showed personal consequences when they discovered that their bank was involved in such businesses: according to the survey, two-thirds would cancel all investments from which money comes out of agrarian speculation.
43 percent would advise against such a bank to their acquaintances, 49 percent would ask, after reflection, to cancel their account and switch to another institute.
The 21st house in Vienna
The Relocated Pavilion
by Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups and downs and a happy ending, the pavilion of the 1958 Austrian Universal Exhibition in Brussels won awards, was in Vienna for a museum, was left empty and crumbled.
It is now reopened as an exhibition house.
Modern postwar architecture is passionate about clear shapes, glass halls, bold curves and new building materials, typical of thinking about technical progress, for which, the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels Universal Exhibition is a suitable and well-known example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion won the Grand Prix of Architecture for its light and floating steel and glass construction.
Construction is considered to be a contemporary landmark of architecture.
He made the architect so well-known that he also built the Austrian pavilion in the next universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent flattened building in Munich, it became internationally known.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions was erected after the universal exhibition at the Schweizer Garten next to Vienna’s South Station, was renovated in 1962 and inside was inaugurated a 20th century museum, called the “20th house”.
The building was suitable but lacked the spaces and technology suitable for a museum; without any wall to hang art, nor a good atmosphere.
Despite this it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and is declining more and more.
Currently, the architect Adolf Krischanitz has reformed the pavilion, now calls it "house 21" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday afternoon the belvedere museum was inaugurated, to which the house belongs, with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in a way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian belvedere gallery since 2007, has achieved a fresh start.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor of art history with a considerable career, among other things, an ice skater in her youth, later in Sotheby’s Guggenheim Museum and founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, carried out the reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectors of the monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the eponymous foundation are exhibited, there should be a cafeteria and a bookstore, and an office building should be built.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do so.
Not only because he significantly reformed the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, he expanded it and was awarded the competition, but because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him an "important and immense place", in which he contemplated "almost every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with its transfer to Vienna in its change of use with generosity and ease.
In the current reforms there are big problems, the building was "an energy-eater," Krischanitz said.
The profile of the windows of the glass façade was changed, an insulating glass reinforced with fiberglass was installed and the glass ceiling was replaced by a special safety glass.
The thermal bridges and steel beams were reinforced or replaced and the asbestos roofs were rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for the new use, a panel of light descending between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter the almost new building, but still the Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in ancient mahogany tones and protected against oxidation.
And the movie theater is exactly as it was before.
And all this with strict control by the monuments office and a low budget.
“I often had to find material that was good, cheap and also liked by the monument protection office,” says Krischanitz and warns of rough soil in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and renovations, the building remains flexible and lightweight.
The “coming from Brussels” pavilion has been difficult, Kristanitz said recently, a typical “casual appearance in the history of the city.”
Such an architecture is “always in the wrong place” and that’s why it wanted to “awaken the right conscience.”
In this case the house 21 is not in the wrong place, there has been an urban coup d’etat. The totally new and planned "central station district", with houses and offices, is located next to the Schweizer Garten.
And maybe there will be another stroke of luck: House 21 could receive a reinforcement from another building by Krischanitz, as collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art hall and, as you can hear, negotiates with the city over a neighboring place in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a winter crisis package that amounts to millions
The company has devised a crisis plan, which would prevent train breakdowns in winter.
The number of staff must be doubled.
Which costs millions.
In the fight against train breakdowns and delays caused by winter, Deutsche Bahn has spent more than 70 million euros this year, according to a news report.
The newspaper "Bild" reported, invoking an internal crisis plan of the group, of the investments planned until 2005 of a total of about 300 million euros.
To achieve better availability of vehicles and the railway network even in extreme weather.
Among other things, it is planned to double internal and external employees to 16,000 positions to remove snow from tracks and platforms.
The goal is to clean the snow and ice platforms for operation and 90 percent of the needles needed for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, chairman of Deutsche Bahn, warned of train failures and delays this winter as well after a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in passenger transport, as, among other things, it lacked reservations due to adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for years for authorization from the federal railway office.
There is also a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the axles of high-speed trains frequently in the workshop, after a high-speed train suffered the breakage of an axle at Cologne’s central station.
Deutsche Bank pays billionaire fines in U.S.
After the tumult over President Josef Ackerman, a new U.S. problem appears, Deutsche Bank must pay a million dollar fine there.
As if the problems were not enough for the Deutsche Bank, its past in the US acquires the giant of the sector, the Frankfurt Institute pays 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in a deal, to end the disputes due to the bankruptcy of five large credit unions during the financial crisis.
It is about the sale of mortgage bonds.
Financial market regulator NCUA accuses many large banks of inducing credit unions with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized the risks.
Such bonds lost their value during the financial crisis and drag the banks to the depths.
"We are pleased to be able to clarify the matter without the parties having to go to court," a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York said.
The bank admits no guilt with the deal.
This also applies to Citigroup, which required a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, president of NCUA, welcomed the deference of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit unions and provides bankruptcy support to protect client investments.
The NCUA seeks to reinstate the losses of millions originated.
The agreements currently concluded are its first type.
The regulator had also called other major banks to account and in summer filed lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the matter of questionable mortgage bonds, these are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on housing credits.
When the U.S. housing bubble burst in 2007, it led to the demise of many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the American investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results happened a few years ago, a complicated wind is currently blowing for American banks.
Investors and inspection have initiated countless processes to receive compensation or sanction defaults.
The Federal Housing Financing Agency (FHFA) has produced the most lawsuits.
It blames the 18 major international banks that the two US state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business by a volume of approximately $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has a lawsuit from the FHFA, dealing with $14.2 billion worth of business from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to answer for “substantial losses,” without naming an exact figure.
The Deutsche Bank rejected the debts as unfounded and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett contributes $10 billion to IBM
Finance guru Buffett invests heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March, it has acquired shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far the great American investor Warren Buffett has always declared not to invest in computer companies or Information Technology since the long-term development forecasts of the companies are negative.
But he has read IBM’s trade report and changed his mind about investing in the sector.
He must have understood long before that IBM primarily offers services and procures computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, an investment by Warren Buffett is considered an honor.
Therefore, the primitive Information Technology should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett revealed on economy broadcaster CNBC that he has acquired IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
Berkshire Hathaway is one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said IBM did not know anything about the compromise so far.
He praised the management that dealt with ordinary profits in the economic crisis.
“They’ve done a great job,” Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has long established lucrative information technology services such as the operation of computing centers.
The old computer pioneer of over 100 years also offers software and advice as well as powerful equipment for companies.
Buffett has avoided tech companies to date.
He said he only invests in companies whose businesses he understands.
On the contrary, Buffett took advantage of the occasion in a freight train, in a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
Berkshire Hathaway owns approximately 80 subsidiaries, as well as part of a number of large consortiums such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
Buffett, 81, took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and, with wise investments, expanded it to become one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his lifestyle is humble.
That’s why it’s an idol for countless investors around the world.
His quick and infallible sense of earning money has given him the nickname “oracle of Omaha.”
After discovering Buffett’s investment, IBM’s shares on the stock exchange rose one percent.
“The Blue Giant,” as IBM is known, has a stock value of more than $220 billion and ranks, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the world’s most valuable technology companies.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he doesn’t want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, its founder, is a close friend.
The threat is concrete
After the discovery of the "Zwickau cell", the Turkish media doubts the German rule of law.
A newspaper speaks of a “bloody ideology” that is reviving again.
The murders of eight small-business tricks and Greeks between 2001 and 2006 have a far-right background.
In Turkey and in the German population of Turkish origin has reacted with fear and concern to this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin, a ghost that was thought dead a long time ago has returned, since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there had been no more episodes of violence with a far-right background against Turks.
However, there has never been any doubt that there is xenophobia in Germany.
The ultra-right network discovered reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were not at all predictable.
“Is the bloody ideology revived again?” headlines the online edition of the Turkish newspaper “Haberturk”.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, points out that one of the perpetrators was an informant of the Federal Defense Office of the Constitution and is concerned that German authorities may be involved in the far-right swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted sensibly, the weekend reminded victims of racist violence with a vigil at the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin along with German and Turkish politicians reflected on a solemn act on the 50th anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
The coexistence was staged with joyful colors, like a story with a happy ending.
The information came to some Turkish media as a slap: “The German gift for the fiftieth anniversary,” says the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform “Haber X,” referring to the background of the chain of murders.
The German broadcast "Hürriyet" also does not insist on tracing this mental connection.
“It starts to smell bad,” says Ahmet Külahci’s column title.
He points out that those killed were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
In the internet forums of Germans of Turkish origin, the behavior of the police and their subsequent success in the searches are discussed very critically.
The authors are astonished that German authorities have not long ago sought out suspects in the far-right circle.
Some are even less rhetorical about the drastic means: “From now on, immigrants have nothing left but self-defense and armaments.”
“This will be the best self-protection.”
“Germany’s internal peace depends heavily on the quality of the clarification and the adequacy of the sanction to the entire network,” Selen writes.
This means that if Germany’s internal peace is in jeopardy, the attacks in Mölln and Solingen will clear up in ninety years.
The image of the ruins of the Solingen fire has been recorded in the German and Turkish memories.
No other event showed more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a concrete threat and, to the Germans, that distrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks heighten the group feeling on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press then criticized mainly the shortcoming of German politics after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refused to visit Mölln's survivors.
After the fire attack in Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish president and Klaus Kinkel, his foreign minister, replaced him at the funeral in Cologne.
It is clear how a person’s value is calculated based on the amount of their taxes.
The current information in Turkish media again shows how deep the distrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country has since been.
In addition to the effort of a broad explanation and a reassessment of far-right terrorism in Germany, this time frank words are needed.
The Bank of Lake Zurich Scandal
The riskiest bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and since then it slipped from one crisis to the next.
It is now run by a German.
Axel Weber didn’t think so.
After his spectacular departure from the federal bank summit, in July it became known that in 2013 he would begin a new and almost equally spectacular job: Chairman of the board of the big Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber publicly rejoices, praises Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its newly acquired solidity and drops kind remarks about his future peers.
“USB has achieved a revitalization.”
"I'm happy to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
In September, it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A USB financial operator in London avoided all of the bank’s security systems and defrauded 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Grübel, managing director of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to come.
The chairman of the USB board has since been considered equally touched, and everyone asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
It was announced that Weber would have to advise the bank as of February 2012.
And he will take over the chairmanship of the board in May, not early 2013, as the bank announced Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather, a professor of economics and a counselor and has had a period of adaptation surely necessary.
Suddenly he takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just re-proved that it deserves the title of “the biggest bank in Europe’s scandal” for a long time.
On the one hand, the USB is huge, until recently it was the world’s largest asset manager, and on the other hand, for years, it slides from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, saves the once so proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis began.
The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the Swiss asset manager discreet and solid, but also clever, combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
On the one hand, with $1.6 trillion, USB manages more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, he advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world’s big banks.
It impresses.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and later professor of banking at Zurich for many years explains: “Before my students, I have always rated USB as a model for a good bank.”
“From the current point of view, one wonders: How could I be wrong?”
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007, it was revealed that something went wrong on the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, CEO, who until then was considered a great and very smart banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank’s investment fund embarked on high-risk losses and had to amortize billions.
To charge this, the USB announced a capital injection of no less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found investors, of course, that some looked with contempt until shortly before: an opaque Asian state fund of Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that its name had never been heard.
This was only the first blow.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, chairman of the board, in 2006 in the second highest-paid board of directors in Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the catastrophe continued, in view of its misinvestments, the UBS found itself in the financial crisis facing bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought troubled securities from UBS for many billions, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond, through which it became co-owner of the bank.
All of Switzerland was affected, it was asserted how dramatic this was for a small country, if it hosts such large banks.
Finally, the sum of UBS’s balance sheet in 2007 was more than five times higher than Switzerland’s economic performance (see chart).
“We can’t rescue UBS again,” said Geiger, a banking expert.
The first disaster was joined by the second.
A few months later, the UBS capitulated to a fiscal dispute with America and was willing to hand over the data of wealthy customers, who had possibly defrauded taxes with the bank’s help.
In addition, it approves a figure of 780 billion dollars, reimbursement of unjustified profits from these businesses with compensation for payment.
With this, the UBS more or less confessed to having aided in tax fraud.
Simultaneously he lost something that had always been his capital in competition for wealthy clients: the halo of discretion.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank’s secret is no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of client funds.
In this way, within a few months the bank lost its credibility in its two core sectors: in investment banking through erroneous speculation and in the management of assets through the aid of tax fraud.
And just when it was a little quieter again, just when it was thought that UBS was getting it back, this unfortunate story of the operator happens, a single operator defrauded 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was wrong.
And it was revealed, apparently, this still does not work well with risk management in investment banking.
“With the Adoboli case it is clear that risk controls have changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the University of Zurich’s Banking Institute.
The chief financial officer of a large German bank is also sure: “The problem with UBS is that it does not dominate risk controls.”
So the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers had been presenting themselves for a long time, emerged: no risk too great, on the other hand, the security of money wants to break across the Alpine republic.
The security deposits of Swiss banks were a symbol of unwavering reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli of authentic chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich doesn’t fit the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank, it’s just a little bigger.
The situation is classic.
The bank is headquartered in Zurich’s Bahnhofstraße, which runs from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostentatious, the rentals are one of the highest in Europe.
Here you can find jewellery such as Tiffany’s among traditional Swiss businesses such as the Sprüngli confectionery.
Swiss banks have resided here for years: from the national bank, through the palace of Credit Suisse, to elitist private banks like Julius Bär.
You enter the reception room of the UBS through a heavy rotary door.
Inside the walls are covered with marble, in front are large leather armchairs, next to the logo of the bank there is a large sign to indicate "security".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
The two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have at some point shifted the idea of the big Swiss bank, or betrayed it, as the president of a small Swiss private bank believes.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all he does, like all Swiss bankers, also with the businesses of both big banks.
The UBS has become too big, he says, mainly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
The Swiss had nothing more to say.
"And they have long been accustomed to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, the UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank, delivered its first big profit and then came disaster, no European financial institution had lost as much money in the high-risk jungle as the big Swiss bank.
On October 15, 2008, the catastrophe was evident.
“That Wednesday the government coalition of the small seven-million-dollar country decided the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation,” writes author Lukas Hässig in his book “Der UBS-Crash.”
Politicians granted as much as 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How do they come up?
You talk to the Swiss bankers, so you see the problem in the dimension of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
A bank arises that, due to the merger, was too big for small Switzerland, and continues to grow.
So it served to make the two different UBS precursor banks complement each other: a rich but dormant bank with the center of asset management in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment banks arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could roll a large financial bicycle.
There are two names related to this UBS rise: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS consortium from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were the perfect team,” says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, the modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive who managed to make his way from learning in the bank to the summit."
Finally, Ospel trusted Wuffli.
And in the end Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: “He thought his models were a reality,” Geiger says.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
It’s clear: The mess came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember managerial meetings, where Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same motto: Getting down from the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They headed the League Tables, the rankings that then documented the success of the banks.
UBS wanted to be at the top.
Some steps went well for him.
In forex trading and stock trading it was at the top.
However, the consultants of the companies in charge highlighted a weak point: In the business of international interest, in the language of "fixed income" banking, there is huge compensation for the big banks.
UBS has gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, the UBS began an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Eager for growth, they invested both the same bank and one of its high-risk funds created in high-risk U.S. investments.
It turned into a powerful machine to take over American mortgage credits and then sell them, keeping certain risks on its own.
And also, like other banks, it sought the descent for a long time.
“In the summer of 2007, as the American real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there,” said Geiger, a banking expert.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
A manager had to leave, as the attempt to order proved more complicated than they expected.
The positions at UBS have become projectable seats and are unsafe to this day.
Currently, he who runs a large bank, has an almost impossible job.
You must find a strategy for a bank, before which all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, a banking expert, has an idea, ending investment banking, focusing on asset management, returning to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn’t want to go that far (yet).
But investment banking needs to go down a lot, it’s clear right now.
Next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the bank’s new president, will present his future strategy to the world.
In reality, only the 51-year-old Swiss-Italian was thought of as a transitional solution, as the bank and the bank were surprisingly separated from their predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he imposed himself: He must permanently run the UBS business, the Zurich bank said Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its state in the mid-1990s.
It abolishes 3,500 posts.
But this is not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What do you want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is sure to ask himself right now.
So far he only says that he will first look for a home with his wife in Zurich.
The next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on U.S. stock market
The impending recession in Europe has scared U.S. investors at the start of the week.
Changes in government in Athens and Rome are still in force.
Industrial production slowed down on the continent stifles hopes of stabilizing a debt crisis at its origin.
There may not be any general relief imposed on the changes of government in Rome and Athens.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glass has been seen half full, not half empty, but now the problems come back to the foreground, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
First of all, financial assets are on the sales list.
The Dow Jones Index of Standard Values closed down 0.6 percent to 12,078 points.
In the session, the market barometer ranges from 12,027 to 12,170 points.
The S&P 500 index closed with 1,251 points, down one percent.
The technology exchange’s Nasdaq index lost 0.8 percent and exited the market with 2,657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax index was down 1.2 percent to 5,985 points.
The industry of the 17 euro countries has clearly reduced its production and is at the end of its boom.
The companies produced two percent less in September than the previous month, as reported by Eurostat’s statistical office.
That created skepticism among U.S. investors: “We are not an island, if not dependent,” said Goldman’s Steve Goldman.
Europe cannot be freed so quickly from a recession, and there are more signs of weakness in the banks.
Warren Buffett, the investment legend, only confirmed this precaution, it is still unclear if Europe is strong enough to do everything necessary to end the crisis, he said in an interview with CNBC.
That is why, from his point of view, it is too early to invest in state loans or European banks.
Instead, it throws off a decade of old principles and enters the U.S. tech sector.
Its investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supports the traditional consortium’s share price and makes it trade against the market trend at first just a higher percentage.
The value closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
After some indications, Buffett paid $170 on average for each unit and kept 5.5 percent.
The stock price of his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
Bank of American equity bonds were clearly strengthened with 2.6 percent of the market.
The house sells almost all of its remaining holdings to the China Construction Bank and pockets $6.6 billion for it.
The institute mainly wants to reinforce its share of capital with the net profit of the business and thereby comply with regulatory requirements.
The Boeing aircraft manufacturer increased its profits and thereby limited losses at Dow.
The share rose 1.5 percent after the consortium took the biggest charge in its history.
Airline Emirates on Friday ordered 50 777 long-haul aircraft and the order value was $18 billion.
Including the options of 20 more machines, the volume amounts to 26 billion dollars.
On the New York Stock Exchange, approximately 710 billion shares changed ownership.
719 values increased, 2281 fell and 79 remained unchanged.
The Nasdaq closes with sales volumes of 1.38 billion, 630 shares up, 1,913 down and 82 unmodified.
Smart Grids Spread in Cities
In many places the lizards are considered "problematic birds": these very intelligent animals are not expelled from the cities for a long time, experts say.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly, the stones belong for years to the image of the city, but in many municipalities the complaints of the neighbors are accumulating for the rubbish and the noise of the animals.
Although no means has appeared against the “problematic birds” so far.
The stones no longer leave the cities, say experts at the first symposium on stones in Leer, East Frisia.
There, specialists from all over the country discuss possible solutions.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Environmentalists attribute the problems of cities to the migration of certain protected stones from the countryside; chemical applications in agriculture visibly wipe out traditional living spaces.
Hunting, growing construction and falling trees that host them make it difficult for birds to live.
The thieves are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There, in 2005, a controversial project to mass murder district thugs leapt into the negative headlines.
Critics have called hunting animals through bird traps and killing with sticks as especially brutal.
"Expulsing and scaring them in a normal way is not possible," said Werner Klöver, an urban planner and landscaper at Leer.
Shooting the nests with water or throwing down the trees are often unintended consequences, says environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
“Animals deviate, large colonies divide and distribute elsewhere.”
Disturbing them is only imaginable as an exception in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We must live with them, we no longer catch them."
Without the surroundings, the problem cannot be solved in cities, says Wolfgang Kellner, Mayor of Leer.
A combination of shunning animals from sensitive residential areas and baits is possible to resettle elsewhere.
"Informational panels instead of chain saws" Uta Maria Jürgens, a psychologist and ethnologist, advertises against animals in order to treat them in a totally different way: "The best thing is that we can stand a beak on the face with aplomb."
Jürgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein the Ascheberger Stones Teaching Circuit, where signs inform about the lives of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion on bird noise criticism: “They’re all forms of communication, they have a lot to say.”
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, the stones not only take advantage of resources to access shaky bites, but they manufacture tools to use them as resources.
Recently, ethologists at the University of Cambridge checked in four beams how far the intelligence of birds reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to drop a stone on a platform to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they determinedly recognized the size and shape of the stone to fall on the platform.
In a second essay, the fat astutes had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small cube with a moth larva in a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not reach their prey with the beak.
But the investigators left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they fished the bucket in the puller of the tube.
Three of the four thieves got it on the first try.
Portugal at Euro 2012 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
The Bosnians and the Turks have no hope in the championship.
The favourites, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be at the 2012 Euro 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have sealed in the play-offs the last tickets for the 2012 Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine.
Guided by triumphant hero Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.), Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1) and, after the 0-0 of the one-way match, made the five Eurocup appearances in a row.
The Czechs got 1-0 (0-0) in the play-offs back game with the outsider Montenegro, after in the first leg (2-0) they made things clear.
Croatia did not let him score in the 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland got a slack 1-1 (1-0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) scored the other goals of Portugal.
Former Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a penalty (41.) and captain Emir Spahic (65.) shortened distances twice to Bosnia.
Sena Lulic got a red card (54.).
Bosnia failed because of Portugal in the play-offs of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal started out perfectly.
Ronaldo performed a free kick from more than 30 meters to get his head in the points.
A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed off his skills to score from afar and got 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who did not show up in the first half-hour, had their first clear shot thanks to scorer Edin Dzeko.
The former player of the team of Wolfsburg, leader of the English Manchester City sent a header to the stick, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek hits for Czech Republic
Then Collegiate Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding was in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penati area, he decided to show the Portuguese the yellow card for throwing himself to the ground (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark pitched a controversial penalty after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which transformed Misimovic.
After the break, the 2004 European runner-up clarified everything with 4 goals.
The Czechs finished the last doubt in the 81st minute with a goal by Petr Jiracek.
The 1976 European champion is qualified for the fifth consecutive time for the Euro.
Coach Michal Bilek’s team with Bundesliga legionnaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nuremberg) was also lucky and had to overcome a second of reaction in the initial phase.
At the last moment, goalkeeper Petr Cech shunned a possible goal on Tomas Sivok’s own goal (9.).
Montenegro had more chances with the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the frontal lap, right on Cech’s goal.
After the break the Czechs had to protect the goalkeeper from the world-renowned goalkeeper, the forward of FC Seoul escaped again (50.).
Finally, the goal before the end felt the match.
Meanwhile, Turkey missed the wonder of Zagreb football.
Four days after the 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not pass a 0-0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that national coach Guus Hiddink was to leave his third-place seat at the 2002 World Cup, the Croatians held their fourth participation in the European Cup final.
In front of 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost got a dream start.
In the seventh minute and with a long-distance kick, Selcuk Inan only managed to touch the pole, but striker Kazim Kazim was not able to send the ball inside the goal either.
After the second of reaction, Croatia took more and more control.
After the break, Croatia did not let any goals be scored.
Alongside VfL Wolfsburg’s Mario Mandzukic, who in the 62nd minute made room for Dortmund’s Ivan Perisic, Danijel Pranjic (Munich’s Bayern) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are the Bundesliga’s legionaries in practice.
Trapattoni goes to the Euro
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate their first participation in the European Cup since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team, who triumphed 4-0 in the one-way match prepared for a previous decision, to lead in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) tied with the invited team.
Ireland pushed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy got his first big shot.
From the first moment, the defense avoided possible goals in the lead.
But in the 32nd minute, he moved it forward.
After a defense by goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward appeared and kicked the ball across the line, scoring 1-0.

Massacre on a personal level
Peter Englund’s intense and generous new book, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An intimate story about World War I, “starts with a long dramatis personae of the kind that can make one’s soul fall to one’s feet.
Here are some action tips: Gently start this page and turn it into your branded pages.
He will get to know these people very well in Mr. Englund’s novelistic narrative, and this dramatis personae will function as his GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, as one of his men and women, he is confused and helpless in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
What he has written here is an unusual book, aptly describing it as “an anti-history work.”
It contains some notable names, important treatises or famous battles; there are virtually no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.
It’s not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as “a book about how it happened.” It’s about “feelings, impressions, experiences, and moods.”
“The beauty and pain of battle” combines the wartime experiences of roughly 20 ordinary men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrators.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their members, go mad, or die.
Their lives flash here like votive candles lit in a church; some new ones are added to the mix while others are turned off.
Mr. Englund’s book is a departure from standard history books.
It is also a corrective to the notion that World War I was only the fatal trench war on the Western front.
“The beauty and pain of battle” moves expertly through other war theaters: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book fall on hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tse-tse flies are an intractable problem.
This is a moving book, almost from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural catastrophe, a hurricane Katrina that stinks the corditate.
When artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you are a woman who is at home with your children, do you stay or run away?
Anyway, who's coming?
Hardly anyone understands what is going on, not even why this war has to be fought.
"Lack of facts," notes Mr. Englund, "has been filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors."
"The Beauty and Pain of Battle" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor in the high seas fleet.
His stories have been obtained for the most part from memoirs, letters and other previously published material.
The explanations of their lives may be terrifying or poignant, but they are more full of life in Mr. Englund’s accumulation of small moments, missing details.
Many of these are about deprivations and fixing them with what’s there.
About telling the story of a German schoolgirl says: “Success, everywhere substitute.”
"Coffee substitute, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues to talk about substitute food in Germany.
It describes “meat made from cooked rice and pressed into ram’s fat (and finished with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made from roots and peels of dried potatoes; shoes with wooden soles.”
There are, he notes, “837 permitted meat substitutes in sausage production, 511 registered coffee substitutes.”
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own drive toward savagery and declares about war: "You feel that, after all, this is what men are designed to do and not to sit in armchairs with a cigar and a whisky, the evening paper or a bestseller, and pretend that that varnish means civilization and that there is no barbarian behind that starchy, studdded chest."
Instead, a British soldier realizes that he will probably die, and that no one will know or care.
“Once you resign yourself to the thought of sacrificing yourself, you’d like to think it could happen in front of the audience,” he writes.
Instead, it is horribly like “a convict being strangled in secret.”
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
“The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition,” Mr. Englund writes, “a war between factories.”
It reflects the arrival of what he calls “a new species in the bestiary of the young century: the eloquent and ideologically convinced mass murderer in good-looking clothes running his butchery while sitting behind a desk.”
People behave in unforeseen ways; there is both innocent and heroic behavior.
Mr. Englund talks about soldiers actively trying to catch a sex disease from prostitutes as a way to evade service at the front.
“The most grotesque expression of this is the trade in gonococcal pus, which soldiers buy and stuff their genitals with in the hope of ending up in the hospital,” he writes.
“Those who are truly desperate rub it over their eyes, which often leads to lifelong blindness.”
In this translation of Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund’s agile but not extravagant prose is perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes it reflects the way the war has “unleashed exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.”
People start asking why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about the First World War have often been indirect, such as The Great War and Paul Fussell's Modern Memory, or novels like Nothing New on Erich Maria Remarque's front, rather than integral stories.
Mr. Englund's volume joins an unconventional pantheon.
His book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a non-fiction work.
I won't reveal it.
But it is as if he had come from his book, ripped that page of dramatis personae from your fingers, and burned it with an eyebrow.
After a previous misstep, a planned assault per minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing riot helmets.
The night was chosen from Monday to Tuesday because Zuccotti Park would be more empty.
The operation was kept secret except for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling the others they were joining an exercise.
Police inspector Raymond W. Kelly was at the center, his presence underscoring how the operation was fraught with challenges for the police department.
The episodes of recent weeks could not be repeated, such as spraying pepper spray on protesters, violating the department’s rules and creating a storm of public sympathy towards the “ocupas”.
The police operation to clear the Zuccotti park of protesters was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The agents had prepared themselves by seeing how the occupations had developed in other cities.
A major disaster drill was taking place on Randalls Island, with one eye looking toward Zuccotti.
The agents increased the so-called disorder training – counterterrorism measures that involved quickly mobilizing large numbers of police officers – to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to enter the park arrived at the “last minute,” said someone familiar with the orders, which referred to the mission only as “an exercise.”
"To the few cops I know who were called for this, they weren't told it was to enter Zuccotti Park," said the person, who spoke anonymously.
“The only people who knew they were going to enter Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the department.”
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, officers wanted to clear the park, but gave up when hundreds of protesters emerged early after hearing about the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from several police units, including special forces from across the city's district - dozens of mobile agents who routinely flooded neighborhoods with high crime rates.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, like those who travel daily to work, had been coming and going from the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to get in.
“It was appropriate to do it when there were the fewest people in the park,” he said.
Trucks from the Emergency Services Unit with spotlights and loudspeakers gathered at the Pike Slip crossing with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The lights and pre-recorded messages ringing from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
Community affairs agents went to the park with their light blue winds, many protesters simply picked up their things and left.
No shops were touched until 1:45 a.m., police said, giving protesters time to pick up their belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen gathering at the perimeter to enter if arrests were needed at the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to abandon him.
Paul J. Browne, the police department’s chief spokesman, said it was for his safety.
But many reporters said they tried to prevent police from taking action in the park, and that they had been treated harshly by the officers.
Mr Browne said mobile television units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, were able to capture images.
As police moved westward through the dense tangle of demonstrators’ belongings, including bags and garbage bags of paper and plastic stuffed with clothes, Cleaning Department teams followed them, picking up what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out, with images appearing on the Internet shortly afterward.
A central group of protesters took positions near the camp kitchen area, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and police came in to arrest them methodically.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp were locked between them by the arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency service agents were called in to cut the locks.
No arrests were made at the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The clearance operation was completed about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr Browne said about 142 people were arrested at the park.
Most of the arrests were for “disruption of public order and resistance to authority,” he said.
The highest-ranking officer on the scene was Joseph J. Espósito, the head of the department, the senior officer uniformed in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the department’s chief of detectives, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, while present, "was not directing the operations," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of agents waited along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Streets, in case they had to enter.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and Pine Street, a block south.
From those positions, police were seen expanding the perimeter even beyond Zuccotti Park.
At one point, a number of agents, many with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people on the northern perimeter.
Some of the most noisy action of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the hood of a police car, and others were seen taking air off the wheels of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
In the end, an officer and a protester were hospitalized.
The union of support workers will sue the city for the redundancies
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools catering to poor students.
The lawsuit is possibly the latest weapon at the disposal of the union, from the 37th municipal district, in its effort to revoke the layoffs.
Six hundred and seventy-two school aides, parent coordinators and other employees who were among the lowest paid in the city lost their jobs on Oct. 7, in a move union leaders have described as political revenge for their refusal last spring to allow the city access to a health care fund run by working groups to close its budget gap.
Municipal authorities have categorically denied this accusation.
At a City Hall hearing last month, education counselor Dennis M. Walcott said layoffs were part of the budget approved in June.
A council member counterattacked by telling him that nothing in the budget specified that the school’s support staff would be fired.
37 municipal district officials said they filed the claim in writing, warning the Department of Education that he would be sued. A press conference will be held Wednesday to announce the official filing of the lawsuit, at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will include Mr. Walcott and the city’s Department of Education as defendants, and has eight workers fired as plaintiffs, all of them black or Latino women, as well as most of the attendees who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the city’s Legal Department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a draft lawsuit obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs in schools in poor areas of the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying that poor schools lost more attendees as they had been chronically underfunded.
While there were no layoffs on Staten Island and a few layoffs in schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school attendants lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were laid off in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Considering the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit says, “This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit.”
P.S. District 36’s budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates additional funding for each poor student enrollment in schools.
The union also claims that high school principals may have been misled by language in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parental coordinators.
The memo used the word "surplus" to describe the action, although "surplus" most often describes the act of moving a teacher from a school payroll to a work bag, whose salaries are paid by the headquarters.
“Sixty-six parent coordinators were fired,” the complaint’s draft says, “and not just in surplus.”
Mission over, Congress ready to reach agreement on Libya
It seems that Republicans and Democrats in the Capitol are finally willing to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All that was needed was for the rebellion to succeed, for veteran dictator Muammar Gaddafi to be captured and killed, and for U.S. involvement to come to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (Democrat for Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republican for Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent for Connecticut), applauding Libyans for their successful rebellion and U.S. troops for their “courage.”
“This resolution is to honor Libya’s braves as they begin to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
“It’s an affirmation of bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations.”
The language may seem harmless, but nothing about the Libyan debate has been easy so far.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties were fighting each other and the White House over drafting a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the U.S. military in NATO’s mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a broad bipartisan margin, and it never came to be voted on in the Senate.
But the same day the bill was rejected in the House, the House also rejected a measure that would have cut funds for U.S. operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a sort of legislative purgatory – with Congress annoying enough to criticize Obama’s handling of the mission, but not so angry as to actually reap the grass under his feet.
Then the indecision of Congress was overcome by events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The Foreign Affairs Committee’s resolution “congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to liberate themselves” and “praises the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also “declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.”
Will the new measure win full support from the Foreign Affairs Committee, or will it divide lawmakers like the June bill did?
The last version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the committee's top Republican.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
Across the Capitol, the House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment demanding a balanced budget, a legislative priority for nearly all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Republican for Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other issue that in fact wins a vote by the entire House or Senate in this Congress.
Other legislators have so far failed to bring their amendments to the assembly, but not for lack of attempts.
Goodlatte’s is just one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, covering a wide range of topics.
Some are duplicates – the same bill is proposed in both the House and Senate – and others with slight variations from each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the budget balance amendment in the House alone, and another handful that “will control federal spending.”
Some of those bills are also identical to each other, but they give their sponsors – especially novice Republicans looking to refine their resumes – the opportunity to boast that they were the “authors” of that measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required both the House and Senate to vote on an amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms that members of Congress can serve, while Rep. Jose E. Serrano (Democrat for New York) wants to remove the two-term limit for presidents.
Rep. Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat for Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among other issues.
An amendment banning same-sex marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as one banning flag burning.
Some lawmakers also want to allow federal laws to be overturned if they are rejected by two-thirds of states.
So enthusiastic that members have been in proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
At the 111th Congress, lawmakers proposed 77 amendments, and submitted 66 in the 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to that of the 1990s, when members regularly tabled more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they weren’t much more successful then than they are now.
The last amendment that was added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but in fact it was proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Stripped but not defeated," Giffords speaks in his first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman burned her to death at a constituent act in Tucson, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Arizona) appeared on national television on Monday night, sang along with the Broadway tune "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said she wanted to recover more than she wanted to return to Congress.
In her ABC News "20/20" appearance with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form prayers and needed walking help.
The program documented his difficult way back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and punctured the left side of his brain, passing from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he returned by surprise to the House to cast his triumphant vote on the debt ceiling deal.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and injured 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described his recovery as "difficult."
When Sawyer asked him how he felt, Giffords, 41, replied, “Quite well.”
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long special "20/20" program, which aired on the eve of the release of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
The special program analyzed Giffords' recovery from the January 8 shooting.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with her head shaved and a long scar piercing her forehead.
She can only keep one or two fingers upright while her husband cheers her up.
Months later, Giffords is seen sitting in a wheelchair as therapists teach her how to perform simple actions.
A movement of the head.
A rash of the lips.
And then, his first word: "What."
Within days, Giffords uttered another word – “toast,” a change request on his breakfast menu.
Videos released by ABC show that music played a central role in Giffords' recovery: The congresswoman is seen singing along with therapists the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who does two hours of therapy every day, said he does not remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said he was reading to Giffords a newspaper article about the March 12 murder when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspect gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a Missouri prison and is being forcibly medicated while awaiting trial.
“A lot of people died,” Giffords told Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that at one point after his wife's recovery, she said, "I've been defeated."
"So, I said, 'Gabby, you haven't been defeated,'" Kelly said.
"You've just been beaten.
And you’re going to get out of this, and you’re going to recover and you’re going to come back stronger than ever.”
Troops make you feel more pity than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines stormed their posts around him.
The etiquette crowd stood up and applauded.
“Men and women were considered heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
A high-ranking military officer at the gala, also known as the then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
“They showed them as a kind of orphaned child,” the officer wrote in an email.
I am sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn't respect, really.
The sharply contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has taken hold of the military and an often distant, sometimes adoring, American audience.
Praise the troops for their sacrifices.
But praise comes at a price, service members say.
The public increasingly acts as if they are sorry for those uniforms.
“We are not victims at all,” said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon depart for Afghanistan.
“But it seems that the only way for some to show their support is to put ourselves in the role of helpless souls.”
The issue is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, who do not want to seem ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by the troops who returned in the final years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, most conversations about pity are conducted quietly and privately among war veterans.
After their two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, retired colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people apart from the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of fear because they confronted the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there would be an “angry and violent veteran below the surface,” said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high-level government job in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt some interviewers had subtly asked him if he would be able to stand under the pressure of a demanding Washington job immediately after his combat tour.
“When you talk about your service, you need to deal with negative impressions,” Cancian recalled telling his children.
Military unrest arises, in part, from American indifference to wars.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely chosen for praise by a country that is unfamiliar with the military and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We as a nation no longer value military heroism in ways that were entirely common in World War II,” said retired Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, praise from politicians and the public largely focuses on the depth of a service member’s suffering.
Troops are recognized by the number of tours they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The military faces increasing pressure to end rape
This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the military for their alleged passivity to rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are organizing for the next one.
First-time soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years and 11 weeks pregnant the night she said she was raped by a partner.
It was October 2008, and he was on his way back to his barracks at Miramar Air Force Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague carrying a pack of 12 cans of beer.
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink.
“It sounded like an alarm signal,” Lyman says.
However, the Texas native put her concern aside.
I thought, no, she's 19.
"He's from Texas," she says.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
Within minutes of entering Lyman’s room, the man approached her from behind, pulling her down and raping her, he claims.
This week, on Nov. 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel eagerly await a court decision at a landmark trial in Arlington, Virginia, that will decide whether the lawsuit they have filed against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce the widespread violation among the military, in violation of the soldiers’ constitutional rights.
Submitted in February by Susan Burke, a Washington, D.C., attorney, the lawsuit initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of whom claim they were raped or sexually assaulted by their peers, and that the military failed to investigate, prosecute, or impart adequate justice after the alleged assaults.
Burke says he's going through the army's major plane, because the problem starts with them.
“The army is a top-down structure,” he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation?
Burke also says that since February, about 400 more survivors have been contacted, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: Instead of accumulating all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak, will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy – in essence, that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries sustained in the armed forces.
By a 1950 Supreme Court ruling called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the damages suffered by active duty personnel.
“The alleged damages are part of the plaintiffs’ military service,” the documents say.
The Department of Defense declined to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, female soldier teams are playing increasingly important roles, especially to reach local women in war zones.
The result: between those two wars, 150 female soldiers have died and two-thirds of them in combat situations.
It’s time for the military to modernize as well, Burke says.
She is not alone in her struggle, and three other demands are underway, besides her own.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic environment.
On the other hand, the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America is filing a lawsuit against the military that focuses on “personality disorder” diagnoses assigned to rape victims in order to give them discharge from service – a common occurrence, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women in Service Action Network, a human rights group.
Her group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing her of discriminatory practices in the way she handles benefit claims for people who claim to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate bills have been tabled in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010, there were 3,158 reported sexual assaults, according to the Department of Defense’s Office for the Prevention of Sexual Assault and Response.
However, the assaults are remarkably underreported, and by the Pentagon’s own estimates, which figure in about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of cases reported in the military went to trial – half that in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke’s case describe his attacks as only the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman’s case, he reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, he says, he was asked to tell the details of his rape 11 times different to a crowd of police, doctors, and commanders.
She underwent a rape kit, and her aggressor's blood - from a cut in her arm - was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which she was asked about having sex with her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people testified as personality witnesses on behalf of the alleged author, who was eventually acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was read,” Lyman says.
"I thought I was going to work - I found myself screaming from the room."
"They put me in the psychiatry unit, and when I left, I remember I told my commanding officer, "That wasn't his judgment. That was my judgment."
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was discharged from service on less-than-honorable terms, preventing her from receiving any benefits.
Whether the case brought by Lyman and his fellow suiters continues is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington Law School.
However, he points out, “In my opinion, they should be able to move forward.”
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I have been a constant critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military is decades behind because it does not have the same incentive and deterrence as responsibility.
“The odds are strongly against them ... but it’s important for them to try.”
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn’t go their way, Burke, the plaintiffs’ attorney, will queue his other hundreds of plaintiffs for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the army on this issue until reform occurs,” he says.
"Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Are Studying You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just another guy airing his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having carried out a massacre in Norway in July, which left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of the time leading up to his attack on his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After this summer’s tragedy, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - just log into Facebook.
“We realized it wasn’t that hard to get to them,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on European digital populism by Britain’s DEMOS think tank.
Facebook’s array of personal information is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with scientific accuracy – the way marketers have been using them for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey asking about their educational level, attitudes toward violence, and optimism about their own future.
Arriving via Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers from 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – all without leaving the office.
“It’s an entirely new way of doing research,” Bartlett says.
Some of the results are not entirely surprising: Online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, male, and angry about immigration.
However, in a kind of twist, “those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind the computer screen.”
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook is becoming an important new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers, and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health issues to social trends as expressed in “Likes,” wall messages, and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, Facebook’s “data supernova” is generating a research boom, boosting the number of academic papers with the site’s name in the title to nearly 800% in the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn’t approach with a folder on the street.
“Before, when you tried to survey people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.”
“You’d have to go through the game, and they’d never let you in,” Bartlett says.
“Facebook eliminates all that – you go to them directly.”
Others say the site could provide a way to identify and address health-social issues.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and her colleagues found that college students who talked about their drunkenness feats on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of having problems with drinking than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as residential counselors, could control the site and intervene to help a student post too many status updates with their drunkenness.
“You can’t treat a problem if you can’t diagnose it,” said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno’s co-author and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at Seattle’s Children’s Research Institute.
“We have found a way to identify at-risk children who would otherwise not be diagnosed.”
Facebook is also constantly “pricking” its own population for data.
The site’s Data Team has compiled statistics on the state of the relationship and Valentine’s Day, the expectation of election turnout in the middle of the 2010 legislative period, and a National Happiness Index (mostly using information that can be accessed – long-time advocates of digital freedom who argue that the site should make available to others their vast amount of data for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not – the sacrifice for being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is to allow the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don’t even know?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, online is a free bar for everyone.
“I don’t think many of the users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be examining their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London’s Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study he conducted with Facebook’s public walls of students.
“As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends.”
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research topic is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it’s impossible to know what part of a user’s profile information and wall messages are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn says.
That’s why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a clipboard and a pen remain the best research tools anyone can use.
“There’s no substitute for getting into the real world and talking to real people,” he says.
“Social research is supposed to be about the social – and a lot of the social still happens offline.”
Cold and inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the brains of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a “resistance” fighter during his first public appearance in Oslo court.
“I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Knights Templar of Norway,” he told a room full of 500 people.
“I oppose the court, as it has been mandated by organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism.”
"I acknowledge the facts but I do not plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because "I did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for him to express his views."
For the same reason he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a written speech in advance, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, barred him from accessing media for four weeks, and said authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others to confirm that he is locked up.
They all attended with the aim of moving towards the conclusion.
“I thought it looked cold and inhumane,” a survivor from Utoya told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
“It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect.”
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked journalists and survivors in the eyes as he walked in and out of the building.
Despite Breivik's strange notion of being part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge determined he is not a mentally ill man, and said there was no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
Some may find it comforting that the July 22 attacks appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that doesn’t automatically soften the pain and confusion that an entire nation still feels.
“I would like it to look like a monster, but it doesn’t,” said one relative of a victim.
“It would be a lot easier if it seemed like it.”
7 Lessons From Steve Jobs' Missing Interview Shown In A Theater This Week
After Steve Jobs’ death on October 5, there were some who compared him to Henry Ford – distinguishing the genius of technology as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans might find more revealing, in a recently rediscovered interview with Jobs that has been dusted off as a preview of a series of special projections in the biggest markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about business processes and product workflows.
He was undoubtedly a self-recognized designer, dreamer and hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and a yonki of flow charts – a man who believed that many executives suffered “a disease that consists of thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product.”
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds about the dawn of the personal computer, and sat for over an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
By that time it had been barely 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was already working intensively at his new computer company NeXT, waiting for the popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringely’s interview was used on Nerds, he said the interview’s originals disappeared during his transport.
It was only after Jobs’ death that a complete VHS copy was discovered in the director’s garage.
This slightly re-released footage is the basis of Steve Jobs: The Missing Interview, which arrives at Landmark theaters on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known for hating in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose their technological philosophies and business strategies.
And very thoughtful.
At four different points throughout the interview, there is great silence between questions and answers - from 10 to 15 seconds of reflections, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts, seeking accuracy.
There are also times when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems impatient due to Cringely’s questions, pushing him to move faster toward the topics or arguments of greater importance.
Shot before the Pixar era, the iPod or the iPhone, there’s something oddly prophetic about The Lost Interview, when Jobs evaluates what he sees other companies doing right and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of computing.
It’s one thing to read posthumous assessments of Jobs’ career, but there’s something raw and inspiring about Jobs that we see here, the anxious dreamer on the brink of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
Not long after explaining everything in detail here, it was and did.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences from The Missed Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
“Through the years in business, I’ve always asked, ‘Why do you do things?’ and the answers that they give you invariably are, ‘Oh, that’s just the way it’s done.’
No one knows why they do what they do, in business no one thinks about things too deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs details his efforts to simplify Apple’s accounting.
Disconcerted by the way costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" that was made to the eye of good cuber, and then adjusted with a "variable" - he developed an automated factory that ensured they could determine commercial costs to detail.
On the joke to the Pope:
Jobs recounts the “Blue Box” he himself built with Steve Wozniak – a device that allowed people to effectively hack into the phone company and make long-distance calls for free.
It has been widely written about the device, but Jobs’ euphoria here in describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
It describes how he and Wozniak tested the box by using a public phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
“We were wrapping things around the world half a dozen times and yelling through the public phone and going back a minute later to the public phone next door,” Jobs says with a laugh.
“We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.”
We both didn’t know much, but we could build a little thing that could control a giant thing – it was an incredible lesson, and I don’t think Apple would have ever existed without it.
Jobs goes on to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandoned, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and requesting to speak to the Pope, while doing his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with the U.S. diplomat, the two burst into turmoil just before the pope himself was woken up to answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and selling on the phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and made a call to him.
Shortly after his 20-minute telephone conversation, Jobs landed a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
“That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my vision of what a company was and how well they treated their employees.”
Jobs later became one of HP’s employees who visited the company’s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer ever made.”
It was as big as a suitcase, had a small cathode tube screen, and I fell in love with it.
She would get a trip to HP as a teenager and waste time with that machine and write programs for it.
About improvising innovation:
At various points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the go.
Soon in his career, as he dedicated himself to selling a handful of motherboards, he was asked by a customer if he could assemble the entire equipment.
Working with only 30 days of credit, I had to figure out the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, while at Apple, he recalls the struggles he faced in developing a computer mouse:
“I remember having dramatic arguments ... they yelled at me that it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I got fed up and went outside and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and that was totally reliable.
About large companies losing strength:
Long before he led Apple’s renaissance, Jobs prophetically envisioned how many industry leaders would stumble on his vision, and lose control of his market share.
"You say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make copiers and printers better, so what?"
You have a monopoly on market share, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing departments increase success, so it’s these kinds of people who end up leading companies and the people in charge of the products are kicked out of the decision-making forum.
The genius of the products that led to that monopoly position rots because of people who do not have the notion of good products vs bad products - the knowledge of the necessary trade.
That's what happened at Xerox.
Xerox could have taken over the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the 90s.
They took the defeat of victory.
On innovation as an artistic expression:
“There’s a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as the great idea evolves, changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about the subtleties of it.
There are sacrifices you have to make – some things you can’t make the electrons do, the glass does them, the robots do them, the factories do them.
You have to keep 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjust them all at once...
In the end it all comes down to taste – it goes down to trying to expose yourself to the best that a team of humans has done, and then trying to adapt those things to what you’re doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We’ve never been embarrassed about stealing great ideas.
What made the Macintosh in part great was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who casually were the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn’t for computer science, I might be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas dine with healthcare law rivals as court accepts case
The day the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to examine the politically controversial question of whether they would accept the challenge to President Obama’s health care law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were hosted at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will present the case to the high court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met in a preliminary hearing to thoroughly study the requests for review.
One of the cases in question was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging total health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying cry for conservative activists across the country.
The judges agreed to admit the lawsuit to due process and, in fact, a 5-and-a-half-hour historic allegation is expected by March, and the result will likely further cloud the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing by the time the court’s decision is known.
The lawyer who will appear in court and claim that the law should be scrapped will likely be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. Attorney General during the George W. Bush administration.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual Federalist Society dinner, a group that has been dedicated to defending conservative legal principles for many years.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that defied the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel hours after the court’s preliminary hearing on the case.
Among the aides was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the most important Republican in the Senate and an outspoken opponent of the health care law.
Special guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It’s nothing new: The two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And it is not something that conflicts with ethical standards.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct that governs the actions of lower federal magistrates.
If they were not, it could be said that they would fall under Canon Code 4C, which says, “A judge may attend events to raise funds from organizations related to the law and others, although the judge may not be a speaker, a guest of honor, or appear on the program of such an event.”
However, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case, as well as to a company with enormous financial interest, was enough to alarm government ethics activists.
“This impressive gap in ethics and indifference to the code goes against the lawsuits of several magistrates that the court abides by the same rules that apply to all federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
“The judges were hoarded in a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have cases pending before the court.”
Their appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undermines any demand for fairness, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in criticism that they too easily mix the court’s activity with the agenda driven by groups like the Federalist Society.
And Thomas’ wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is magistrate Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as the Obama administration’s attorney general when the first legal challenges to the law were presented in the court of first instance.
Her critics have pushed for Kagan to refrain from seeing the case, saying she was too involved in upholding the law as yet to be impartial.
Kagan hasn't given any indication that he's going to.
Boeing Receives Record Order of $18 Billion
Emirates is ordering 50 Boeing 777 double-aisle aircraft, with an option for 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Oman Air, an operation valued at more than $1 billion.
Rarely is it news when a company gets an order for 50 units of its product.
But it’s a big deal when the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the selling price for the 50 planes rises to a record $18 billion.
It is as big as the place where Boeing received the order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a study released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that over the next 20 years airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced over the weekend its largest ever order for commercial jets for its dollar value - 50 double-aisle Boing 777 jets.
The successful order came from Emirates in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more planes, which would raise the total selling price to $26 billion, Boeing announced at the Dubai Airshow 2011.
Then on Monday, Boeing said Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which boasts of fuel savings and spectacular passenger services.
The selling price for six of them is more than a billion dollars.
"This clearly has a huge positive effect on Boeing," Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora said.
"The quality of these particular customers is very strong."
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by their oil-producing nations.
Therefore, not only do they have the money to pay for planes, but an increase in fuel prices - usually detrimental to airlines, because it is one of the biggest costs - is not so detrimental, because the country is making money with the increase in the price of oil.
That’s important because they’re less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices rise, Dihora said.
“They have natural protection,” he said.
The Emirates order solidifies Boeing’s leadership in the wide-body aircraft market and helps keep at bay the attempt of its competitor Airbus SAS to invade its dominance with the A350 passenger jet.
Boeing’s victory at the air show comes four months after Airbus said it was going to delay the debut of the larger A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
It delayed the debut to add more momentum after customers demanded an increase in payload and range.
Boeing Co’s shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the president of Mexico, apparently defeated in the vote of Michoacán
Luisa María Calderón claims that the drug traffickers helped her PRI opponent, Fausto Vallejo, in the bid for governor.
President Felipe Calderón’s sister appears to have lost her candidacy for governor of Michoacán during the state’s violent election, and she said Monday that drug traffickers helped tip the race in favor of one of her opponents.
Preliminary results gave the lead in the race for governor of the western state to Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
“The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and, especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country,” Luisa María Calderón said in a radio interview a day after Sunday’s vote.
“They threatened our candidates, our electoral workers... They seized the ballot boxes, they installed barricades... and they ordered the people to vote” in favor of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
However, it is the staging of a comeback, and the victory at Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have narrowly outperformed Calderón, who had led the polls before the election.
Calderón, a candidate from his brother’s conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the office of governor, came in third, a major defeat for the divided and unfortunate left before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of the state of Morelia, denied ties to drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamines.
It is the home state of President Calderón, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive directed against traffickers in December 2006.
However, the violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election while campaigning for Luisa María Calderón, and numerous candidates abandoned local candidatures out of fear.
Although for the PRI, however unpleasant Michoacán’s election may seem, a victory will help boost the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential election, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said: “I think this victory should be very encouraging, ahead of next year.”
BAsD urges Asia to help rescue eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has called on India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would impede the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, director general of the Manila-based Asian Development Bank, said the world’s two fastest-growing major economies had to “do everything possible” to accelerate the bloc’s recovery either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries watching Europe’s hardships in an “unbiased” way and said Asia’s financial assistance along with European leadership and resources would help avert a long-term crisis in the global economy.
“We’re all in this together.”
“So anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is helpful,” he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asia can be protected to some extent, but it cannot be immune.”
“So if China and India can help, let it be by all means.”
The European monetary union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s borrowing costs have skyrocketed dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that it could push the world economy into recession and has generated calls for major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said bilateral assistance – such as the purchase of bonds from the EU’s bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Fund – offered greater bargaining power for Europe’s Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India's trade minister, said "India will do everything possible" to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering from falling exports and depletion of foreign capital inflows.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,” he said.
“We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not an option, it’s an imperative, because where do we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women?”
Others argue that developing economies like India have no responsibility to help wealthy Europeans when facing their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the U.S., said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe to India’s 1.20 billion people, of whom as many as 800 million live on about $2 a day or less.
“At some point they will realize that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on vacation to the beaches and that won’t look good,” he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep the many well-paying Greek public sector workers in jobs from mismanaged, loss-generating companies like railways.
Mr Nag said the eurozone crisis threatens "major chain effects" across Asia.
The Asian Development Bank’s forecast of 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 now faces “downside risks” due to Europe’s threat.
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to make “contingency plans” to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Pentagon warns of potential defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warmed up Congress on Monday, warning that the upcoming automatic budget cuts could undermine national security and trigger a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors, to Afghanistan’s battlefields, to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon is already digesting the $450 billion in cuts over the next decade, but now fears an additional $600 billion or more in cuts that may be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
“The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department,” Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, a Republican for Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, a Republican for South Carolina.
He said Congress’ failure to reach agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called “kidnapping,” would result in 23 percent global cuts and a halt to many new projects.
“Such a large cut, applied in this indiscriminate manner, would make most of our naval and construction projects unexecutable – you can’t buy three-quarters of a ship or a building – and seriously damage other modernization efforts,” Panetta wrote.
“We would also be forced to remove many of our civilian officials involuntarily and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to license civilians in order to meet the target.”
“These changes would break faith with those who maintain our army and would seriously harm goodwill.”
Cuts would eventually reach combat troops, Panetta said.
“While funding for wartime overseas contingency operations accounts is not directly affected by the kidnapping, war efforts would be negatively affected by severe disruptions in base budgets,” Panetta warned.
“The hiring of personnel would be reduced, which would lead to delays in contracts and supervision of the contract that supports the war.”
Payroll staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in payments to suppliers in time of war, and legal and political support would be disrupted.
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information about the possible impact of the automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
“The consequence of a kidnapping in the Department of Defense would result in a rapid decline of the United States as the world’s leading military power.”
“We are firmly against this draconian action,” the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta’s letter.
“This is not an outcome that we can live with, and it is certainly not one that we should impose on ourselves.”
“The kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not be allowed to happen.”
Whether Panetta’s letter and the senators’ recent warnings will increase pressure for a budget compromise or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly outspoken about possible cuts, even though he came to a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of budgeting experience in Congress and the White House and knowing he was facing tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Defense Secretary painted a bleak picture of what might be ahead – an army with a shell, but not a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a bullet-free brigade."
"It's an air wing without enough trained pilots."
“It’s a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to carry out the mission,” Panetta said in opening remarks at the Pentagon.
“It is a force that suffers from low morale, poor preparation and is unable to keep up with potential adversaries.”
"Indeed, it invites aggression..."
In an appendix to her letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta lays out new details of how the reductions “generate significant operational risks: delay in response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limit our ability to be deployed and previously engaged around the world; and pose an unacceptable risk in future combat operations.”
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could face the axe, including those that are already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
That list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter fighter, a new planned bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat ship and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 could generate some $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but supporters say it is the next vital step to improve and address potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to spot a lie
A look at the latest headlines tells us how serious and ubiquitous deception and lies are in daily life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accuses of lying to the other.
Pennsylvania State University administrators have been charged with perjury for allegedly hiding reports that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was “picked” with an open microphone claiming to U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
Congressman for New York and internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a mockery with his denials quickly rebuffed by the irrefutable proof.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign funding violations related to the cover-up of an extramarital relationship.
And, again, no one who lived it will ever forget the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton by lying during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends about traps in school and university exams are widespread.
There have been instances where teachers have given test responses to students in order to be better viewed in their performance assessments.
Mentors who should be teaching otherwise are sending the message that lying and deceiving are acceptable.
How much deception do we find?
On any given day, studies show that they can lie to you anywhere 10 to 200 times.
Sure, many of those lies are pious lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of getting to know each other.
Detecting lies, or “the location of lies,” is an essential skill that we must all acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is to exclaim: “I have you,” the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data obtained over the past six decades at prestigious universities that carried out in-depth research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the old myths about lying have been rebuffed.
Liars look into the eyes.
They don’t always stutter, stutter, rub or worry.
Nor can it be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or unmask.
A trained lie detector can come to the truth by learning about the structure of the statement, the microfacial expressions, the formation of questions, and the times.
I spent several years probing scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and ever-emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that deception detection is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps navigate our complex world – especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, or managing negotiations.
Good liars have the ability to read others well, making them feel comfortable, managing their own emotions, and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men tell more "self-oriented lies," while women tell more "self-oriented" lies -- usually to protect someone's feelings -- that married people lie less often to their partners than people who aren't married (but the lies they usually tell tend to be "unfortunate".
We also know that if you are perceived as a wrongdoer, others will feel less guilty about lying to you.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, look at the subject’s usual behavior.
This is called “creating a baseline.”
It helps to provide benchmarks to then measure changes.
Observe the subject’s posture, laughter, and vocal characteristic.
It’s best to know if someone normally hits your foot all the time so you don’t make unfair accusations when you see your feet beating in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for deceptive, verbal, and nonverbal behavior groups.
Consider these behavioral groups as warning signs, not evidence of deception.
People who cheat can freeze their upper body as they try to remember their story, they can point their feet at the door, lean toward an exit, change their post-interview posture significantly, or exhibit a “post-interview exhaustion” – that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of posture once all the tough questions are over.
Often interrogators falsely show that the interview is over just to seek that post-interview relief.
Also pay attention to the subject’s vocabulary.
Scott Peterson pushed his leg to the bottom and used the past time while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, launching a nationwide search for her.
People who cheat can also use a distancing language: “I didn’t have sex with that woman...Miss Lewinsky” or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of “restrictive language” when answering a difficult question: “Well... to tell the truth... as far as I know... as I understand.”
This makes the response a perception rather than a fact and is often a wake-up call.
There is no magic formula to detect lies, but developing skills to discover deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone’s chances of avoiding being victimized by scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan diverted following the threat of U.S. delay in its approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- enraging unions as it appeased environmentalists -- the company that seeks to build the pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project to reroute it.
TransCanada said Monday night it will move the planned pipeline out of the environmentally sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska, and is confident the project will gain approval.
The company announced the decision at a news conference at the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada executive Alex Pourbax says the company maintains its confidence that over time the pipeline will be approved, although it is true that with a different route.
This follows the State Department’s announcement last week that they would delay the decision by a federal permit for the project until potential new routes are studied that avoid the areas of Nebraska’s Sandhills and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast groundwater supply.
"This is a real path of progress," Rep. Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican, told Fox News.
The new State Department-ordered environmental review is likely to set aside any decision until 2013, after next year’s election, though officials denied the policy was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a statement written last week, described the decision as the State Department’s request, and expressed his full support to them.
The 1,700-kilometre pipeline would stretch from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would bring 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To do this, it would have to cross six states.
He is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, who have bet on the estimated 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are weighing legislation to force a move away from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department’s current environmental impact study found that the project only raised limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry source said the department’s inspector general has ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether TransCanada lobbyist Paul Elliot, who served as Hillary Clinton’s campaign adviser in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a firm that was hired to run the original studio was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a child to vomit in fear
A New York family claims that disco music diva Patti LaBelle behaved like a mad woman in the lobby of her Manhattan building, terrifying her young daughter to the point that she vomited out of fear.
The singer’s diatribe frightened 18-month-old Genevieve Monk, so much so that she suffered “personality changes, sleep disorders” and “increased her fear of strangers,” her family says at the Manhattan Supreme Court.
It was on November 10 last year when tramliner Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was picking up the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building, carrying her luggage, taking her to Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stood near the door and put her daughter on the floor for a moment.
“Someone came up from behind and said, ‘Do you know what your daughter is doing?’ I said ‘yes’ and went to get her,” she said.
LaBelle was angry at the pregnant woman.
"He said in an aggressive tone, 'You shouldn't have left your daughter near the door,'" Roseanna Monk said.
“I said, ‘I have no interest in what you say or think.’
He got angry and started using bad words - the word C and the word J aloud...
I had a bottle of water and started throwing the water out of the bottle at me.”
He said Genevieve got hysterical.
“I said to this woman, ‘Look what you’ve done to my daughter,’” the girl’s mother said.
LaBelle shook over the mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and had to be restrained by her surroundings and pulled out of a car waiting for her, Roseanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so hard she vomited, she added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but did not get an answer.
The lawyer and LaBelle representatives did not return calls to comment on what happened.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but the family’s attorney, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money it gets to a cancer support association.
“The purpose is to hold Patti LaBelle accountable for her behavior,” Davis said.
“That kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when you address a kindergarten teacher who is holding an 18-month-old boy in her arms.”
Climate Adversity Stopped the Economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, unemployment and informality increased in Sinaloa, foreign investment fell and the economy contracted.
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the government of Mario López Valdez, self-described of the change, which generated great expectations regarding the progress in the economy, but given the climatic adversity at the beginning of the year, there is no growth, but there is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures in February, in addition to causing millions of losses for the agricultural sector, limited the chances of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction in overall economic activity of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the historical fall of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report of frost damages, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there was damage in 582,835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 percent had partial damage, the main crops affected were those of vegetables, corn and chickpeas.
The fall in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography first thousand people, the state unemployment rate during the first three quarters of the year was observed an accelerated growth, since while from January to March 55 thousand 053 people were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the population being economically active to 5.
Lower liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for the economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that have been carried out since public policy.
“What is being seen is a growth in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market as a result of a restriction of resources by legislation passed in Congress to combat money laundering, since it is not easy for people who illegally grab dollars to work, invest them and use them in something,” he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that the increase in unemployment also has a demographic factor.
“The number of people who leave the state looking for work abroad in the United States has been restricted, first because of the difficulties to enter, and second because entering already has many difficulties to find work, those people are staying and are demanding sources of work here in the state, which causes unemployment to rise,” he said.
Informality
The analysis of the labor market of Signeño is aggravated by considering the high level of informality that predominates among the working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the employed population in the state works without being listed as a worker before any social security institution.
In addition to unemployment and informality, another of the state’s labor arrears are low wages, the entity has the lowest salaries in the country, according to records from the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Security.
The average monthly income of the workers in Signo was, until September, 5,352 pesos, well below the national average, located at 7,375 pesos.
Contraction of FDI
Combined with the fall in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, during 2011 there was the largest decrease in Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years, according to the Ministry of Economy from January to June of the state FDI totaled $ 630,697, representing a drop of 87.74 percent compared to the $5.143,312 million registered during the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the Secretariat for Economic Development of the State Government accounts for a total investment of 17,280 million pesos in the year, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The Debt
Faced with the scenario of economic contraction, the State Government requested in July the approval of a loan of 3 billion pesos, the same that would be destined to invest in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the approval of the local congress was for an amount of 2.6 billion pesos, and until November they have not observed the benefits of the state economy in any sector of debt.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, the first year of the government of Mario López Valdés shows a lack of management capacity of the government.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 there was a lack of harmonization of the wills of the different sectors, including the state government itself.
“The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really poor, we have to work hard to recover the ground that we lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble efforts, we lacked to align everyone’s effort and above all the good progress already synchronized of this new government team, we hope next year will be much better,” he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López said events like the frosts at the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
“Low economic flow is the product of several events, including frost, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn around fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing well below the expectations we had,” he said.
Redefine Vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Patronal Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, he said that it is necessary to refer the state to productive activities of greater dynamism.
“Overall we have observed that work has been done, we believe it is necessary to develop a long-term program in which the vocation and economic direction of the state is redefined, because it is important that the full potential of the material and human resource that Sinaloa has be unleashed,” he said.
Work to be done
The president of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better directs the efforts of the Government.
“In general terms I would say that the government has been striving to give good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there are some advances but it is important that a long-term program is developed,” he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in its conduct of public policy.
“There are elements that allow to say that the government is being more inclusive, I can say that there is work done and I think the government is aware that there is work to be done,” he said.
He was convicted of 8 kilograms of marijuana.
A neighbor of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in fine for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Office of the Attorney General of the Republic reported that the convicted narcomenudist is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by elements of the Mexican Army, on June 7, 2010, in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of post 80, in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The narcomenudist was riding in a white pick-up truck, carrying a black bag in the car’s box and a small backpack in the copilot’s seat, where the military found eight kilograms 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured was made available to the Second District Judge and the sentenced remains intern at the Center for the Execution of the Legal Consequences of the Crime.
Must contribute to works
Social works included in programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or having serious delays due to lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The director of municipal social development indicated that although so far the work programs have progressed, they are at risk because they have not complied with the State Government with the contributions that correspond to them, which add up to a resource of more than 11 million pesos in the three programs.
He pointed out that in total the investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos, of which the State corresponds to 25 percent and that so far only the Federation and the Municipality have contributed resources for the works, so the possible delay in the completion of these becomes effective.
“They have almost 12 million to contribute and even though the year is about to end they have not given us a fifth, when since July they should have given us a share,” he said, “we have started the works and they are very advanced, but we need the money.”
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with the contributions that corresponded to them, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the more than 7 million that the state administration did not contribute on that occasion.
"It happened to us in the previous six years because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs continued to walk, and this year we had to get the resources to cover what the state left pending," he said.
Despite the commitment of the state authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, he said that the request has been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to hasten the efforts so that the percentages that correspond to them reach as soon as possible.
“It’s almost 12 million that they have to contribute and even though the year is about to end, they haven’t given us a fifth.”
Corte validates 'analog blackout' in Mexico in 2015
Replacement of analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional disputes brought by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analog blackout" from 2021 to 2015, by not meeting the eight votes necessary to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers by issuing the decree detailing the actions to be taken to achieve the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With that result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic was dismissed for failing to reach the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and this remains in force.
The draft judgment, drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed declaring the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television matters is a faculty reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and law reservation.
In favor of the project, only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree, and by admitting the demands, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions arranged in it for the digital transition.
The plenary of ministers also decided to dismiss the lawsuit filed by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the discussion of the project, also in charge of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the minister-president said he does not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general rules the measures for the public administration to be prepared.
"I also do not consider that if it did, the autonomy of the regulatory body would be affected," and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector corresponds to the Federal Executive, which has the constitutional mandate, the rectory of the State.
Replacement of analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years, and results in better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Postponing change, he said, would be postponing the benefits of digitalization, which involves a decision in the public interest, which does not only have a technical dimension, “because it encompasses economic, social, political and national security issues.”
These issues, he stressed, "require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of economic rectory of the State, encompasses a group of powers that the Constitution leads to the power of the State Executive."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition, and has done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, in issuing the contested decree, would in any way invade the sphere of competence of Congress, since it is providing in the administrative sphere the observance of the laws issued by the legislature, he said.
Possibility of a "vote-by-vote" count in Michoacán
According to the data released by the PREP, the difference between first and second place of the governor’s election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6,74 total minutes.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality as far as this year's election process in Michoacán is concerned, where according to the data released by the Preliminary Election Results Program (PREP) the difference between first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
In this regard, the president of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, just on November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines in order to harmonize local rules with federal reform in electoral matters.
As will be remembered, Michoacán did not homologate its Political Constitution or its State Electoral Code or its Electoral Justice Law, since the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal deadline for them to enter into force in the present electoral process and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted their publication within the deadlines provided for in the Law of the Official State Newspaper, which had some objections.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute promoted by the local Legislative Power and described as "invalid and illegal" the state president's vote to constitutional reforms, since he has no right to "sanction or veto them".
Interviewed about the possibility of the "vote by vote", María de los Ángeles Llanderal explained that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the IEM will be possible the realization of partial and total counts of the vote by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial counting of votes, one or more electoral packages, may occur in the event that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of scrutiny and counting in the file of the box or does not open in the possession of the president of the same; or, when there are obvious errors or alterations of the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the vote received in all the boxes of the election may be made when there is evidence that the difference between the candidate alleged to have won the election in question and the one who has obtained the second place in the vote, is equal to or less than one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express request from the representative of the party and/or coalition that nominated the second of the nominated candidates.
The total vote count may also be made if at the end of the ordinary count it is established that the difference between the supposedly winning candidate and the second-placed candidate is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is an express request from the representative of the political party whose candidate was second-placed, in which case electoral packages that have been partially counted will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that in this situation is the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and second place is just 0.16 percent, although without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered in the mountain range of Zapalinamé, confirms the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés arrived in Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday night, during Monday held reconnaissances and a mass of requiem.
According to his relatives, the last will of the lieutenant colonel was that his ashes be scattered in the mountain range of Zapalinamé.

Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young to enter the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some didn’t believe it because they said he even got dizzy in the truck; however, he always sought to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good person, "only in Saltillo was the whole family wanted to greet him, as the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man remembers that even when he was seven years old he traveled to Zapopan for the graduation of his family member, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he liked most in life: piloting an aircraft.

Three corpses found abandoned in Cadereyta NL estate
Hours before the discovery, the military authority presented to the media eleven people who were arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot dead in different parts of the body and shot with grace, in an abandoned estate in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The find happened at kilometer 1.5 of the Cadereyta to Santiago road, at the height of the community known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed by the place observed that in the fifth, whose cladding is beige with coffee, was the door open from door to door.
Looking inwards, about three meters away, they located the bodies of three people, so they immediately gave notice to the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow beach dress with dark denim trousers, without shoes; on his side was another with a white straps beach dress.
Within a meter was the body of another individual with a red beach dress and blue denim pants.
All three were upside down.
According to data obtained at the site, the three people were reportedly killed elsewhere, as no caps were found at the site.
In the fence of the fifth one can see legends that are directed from one group of organized crime to another, in addition to several bullet holes in the same and the gate.
Captured at 11 in Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defense presented 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and who are related to kidnappings, homicides, "halconeus" and clandestine burials.
According to information released, in a first event on November 11 in the colony Los Alveros eight people were arrested and one who remained deprived of her freedom was rescued.

When they were stopped and inspected, the military found a long gun, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Subsequently and after these statements, on November 13 at 14:00 hours one of his accomplices was arrested in the ejido La Frauda, who, seeing the military tried to flee.
They are credited with clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the president of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has placed that country on the verge of economic disaster.
Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with Italy’s president on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and endangered the entire eurozone.
A presidential palace statement announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm he can form a government.
It is expected to present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he would present the president with the results of his talks with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," he told reporters.
Monti did not say explicitly that he could form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
The “framework is now well delineated,” he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, far less than normal, as Italy grapples with a political and financial crisis that has pushed the costs of its debt to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain the battered confidence in Italy.
Underlining the pressure on Monti to hurry, market instability put the yield on Italian BTP bonds at 10 years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be bailed out.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of Italian employer Confindustria, told reporters after meeting Monti: "We said we would very much support this government."
We believe that this Government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti’s chances of success were boosted considerably by the support of Silvio Berlusconi’s PDL party, which the crisis forced him to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined to have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party, told reporters.
The support of the PDL, Italy’s largest party, is significant because so far many of its members had opposed the technocratic majority government that is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what will likely be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockade or delay in their efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack by financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks joined the pressure by warning that a failure of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as with youth and women’s organizations.
It will end its round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was named Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would step down, Italian debt costs have now returned to critical levels amid uncertainty over whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Rescue Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the eurozone’s current financial defenses.
Monti has said his government should last until the next election, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms before advancing the election.
Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist it should only be made up of technicians, an indication of his reluctance to deal with a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources noted that mutual mistrust and disagreements between parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The strength of the Spaniards is superior to that of the Tics.
Of the 22 footballers called from Spain, ten exceed 50 international games.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 convoked reached the 50 meetings.
A capital contrast to that of Costa Rica, if you compare the 22 summoned by both countries for today’s friendly, at 3:05 p.m., at the National Stadium of San José.
While the world and European champions, number one in the monthly FIFA rankings, account for an extensive record of A-class inter-selection games, the Tricolor only owns defender Michael Umaña as the only one to have the 50 international matches.
This figure was reached the previous Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), at Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the All-Star League and in powerful Premier League clubs maintain intense activity in league and domestic cup championships, and high-level clashes in European cups such as Champions League.
To the above is added the experience with the Spanish Fury in complicated qualifiers of the Eurocup and the World Cup.
Tic footballers, on the other hand, have a limited international stature in one area, such as Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the highest record of the Spanish national team is by the goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who the previous Saturday against England (fall 0-1 in London) equalled the record of the exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against the Tricolor and will impose a new record for Spain of 127 internationalities.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona’s brain flyer, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the week before by UEFA along with the other centenarians of the Iberian team, the aforementioned Zubizarreta with 126 and Schalke’s ram, Raúl González, with 102.
Nearly the centenary figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the tick side, and close to Michael Umaña, are left-back Junior Diaz, with 48 presences and gunner Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five surpassed the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernandez with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
More than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 appearances, appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest won't be around 8:00.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and ?lman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not yet made their debut.
Spain’s historic goalscorer is David Villa, with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records the most with nine, two more than Carlos Hernandez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quintet included the country in its two-decade-long celebration tour
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to perform one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
It’s been more than 20 years of waiting, but the band says it will also make the dream of playing in the country a reality for them.
This was assured by bassist and founding member Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is in the South American wing of its two-decade celebration tour and on Sunday the 20th will make its only stopover in Central America.
That day they will perform at the Estadio Nacional, starting at 7:30 p.m., alongside the Angelina band The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, whose full transcript is in The Nation on the Internet.
For their Costa Rican fans, it is a dream come true that Pearl Jam is going to play in Costa Rica, are they aware of what their fans are living?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is just our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I have only been to Costa Rica once and on vacation; it is such a beautiful country and I think we will be able to stay there for a few days.
So we’re excited to bring our music there.
I ask you because there is a kind of devotion to the band, the fans live with intensity the previous days.
What do you say to your most ardent followers?
Thank you for staying with us through all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we regret that it took us so long to get there.
Some people already refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a bit of pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve played over the last 21 years have happened over the last couple of weeks.
We played a couple of gigantic shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We’re really looking forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did they discover Costa Rica and its surf waves?
We have a lot of friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are amazing.
My friends were always going to go surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, they are great places to surf; that’s how we found out, through people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, they have been delivering huge shows with a lot of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never played there before, then we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to give the best show possible with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What's the reason for this?
I think it’s partly because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose which songs to play each night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven’t played for a while, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons we liked those songs and that we may have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting to us and, therefore, I think it also makes it more interesting to people.
With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you’ve achieved?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I don’t think any of us imagined that we’d be in a big rock band and having done it for over 20 years ago that felt like a dream.
We keep counting our blessings and are so excited that we can keep making music together.
We all love and love making music.
We’re lucky to go to places in the world we’ve always wanted to go.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean for you to have been a fundamental part of the emergence of grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of that group of great bands.
We are very close to the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It’s amazing when a movement arises from a group of friends and is something unusual.
From time to time, a band emerges from a city, but it’s much stranger when five or ten bands leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we’re lucky to be friends with all of them still and we’re honored to be part of that Seattle sound that came up.
It’s also very strange that a band like yours stays together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which, by itself, is much longer than many bands last.
First, I think we’re all lucky to still be alive and second, we all care about each other.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also opened up that give freedom to each one to experience.
We trust each other with each other’s music and it couldn’t be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been simple; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we have grown, it has been easier to find a balance.
We make sure you’re not too on tour because it’s easy to fall into that game of big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are there for the music, that reminds you that you must respect the music and what brought it, without being capricious about being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was a great thing.
We were a band for almost three years and never released a record until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There was a lot of frustration because it lasted so long and the most important thing is that we’re still really friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started out in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a photo I think about the amazing person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and much more.
He was an amazing human being and we missed him.
The national band Las Robertas will be in charge of opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you picked her for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band we liked the most, so we are looking forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and must be very entertaining.
Why do they always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter live?
That’s a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don’t know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing that comes to mind.
As a bassist, what are your influences?
There are so many.
Among the first that I think of are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep grunge relevant even though it is no longer a fad?
I think all of us always feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned before, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all of them that came out at the same time, and, if there’s relevance now, I think it’s something wonderful because it’s music that’s worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are making better music now than ever.
At first, his music had darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It’s interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that may seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs though they may sound a bit positive.
With both of them, when Ed touched me, I cried when I heard them and they are deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and there’s some trauma in your life and you lose a family member or a friend, those things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs, no doubt, represent that to me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is hospitalized again for medical exams
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted Tuesday to a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength he has in his legs, his GP said.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his rule (1990-2000), suffers from several ailments, including a cancer in the tongue for which he has been operated four times and which remains under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told TV Channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength of its lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of the pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, he said that he does not want it because he knows himself innocent.
He was operated on four times for tongue cancer, has a weight loss of 18 kilos that have been added to other pathologies such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor said.
Fujimori has been held in detention since September 2007 at the National Directorate of Special Operations of the police.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people at the hands of an army annihilation squad that operated clandestinely in the early years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official group, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica and made up of several ministers and businessmen, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highlight of an extensive agenda of meetings with political and commercial authorities and a meeting with the Uruguayan community living in Mexico, according to the agenda circulated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "suitable for the exchange of information on all political matters between the two nations," the South American country's presidency said on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderon to support Uruguay in the incident with France when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on a list of tax havens, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that provoked the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultation with its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing since November the G20, a group made up of the world’s most powerful emerging and developed countries, and has been in place with the South American country since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to expedite the completion of tax exchange agreements in order to exit the “grey list” of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), made up of countries that have not implemented all international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
On the commercial level, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) that has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The mustache plumber passes all three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly over 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but never before in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which hits stores around the world this month, has been designed from the start to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS handheld system, which allows you to play in three dimensions without the need to wear glasses.
“Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy should work without glasses,” Nintendo’s Spanish press officer Omar Álvarez said during the video game’s presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally intended for that support", as hits such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman has argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth game.
Álvarez has stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hook less skilled users.
Once passed, the more experienced players will be able to take a "second turn" at the game levels, which this time present greater difficulty.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This three-dimensional foray of Super Mario also involves the return of the character to a portable console, a fact that did not occur since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo winks to the fans of the saga and repeats the formula of success of previous deliveries, consisting of the mustache plumber will have to go through mined platforms of danger with the aim of freeing Princess Peach.
Although the player will find novelties in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also a "playable" Luigi.
Colom endorses Portillo’s extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced Tuesday that he has proceeded with the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to answer in the United States for the conspiracy to launder $70 million.
Thus ends the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that demanded Portillo to judge him there.
At a press conference, Colom said his decision was due to the independence of judicial and executive powers, taking into account that a sentencing court had already ordered the extradition.
He said that during his tenure he "did not get his hands on" court rulings and processed all the extraditions he has known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Maroquín will be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What Colom did is an executive procedure after all the judicial and constitutional instances to prosecute the former president between 2000 and 2004 were exhausted.
According to decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once he has solved his legal situation in Guatemala and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of the Q120 million embezzlement in the Ministry of Defense when he was president, which was the process that preceded extradition, but the Public Prosecutor’s Office appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to prevent the fall in the marginality of untrained boys
The balance sheet of the first 25 years of life of the social support organization Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation over this quarter of a century.
To this is added the hundred long jobs currently obtained for this social group.
The anniversary was used yesterday to take stock in an event held in the old factory complex of Fabra i Coats attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the neighborhood of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, without a job, with problems of dogradición or in a situation of falling into marginality.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu concentrated a large number of leaders of entities and institutions that in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in full electoral time, showed the unitary character of the work done by Trinijove.
Together with the president of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the event was attended by the former advisor of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall, and the former mayor and current ecosocialist councilor Ricard Gomà.
Also attended by the great hall of the Fabra i Coats the current councilor of Social Welfare i Família, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the general director of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
But he claimed that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current one is too, but added that the work done so far "is a good base".
The president set an example for Trinijove, who knew how to fight bad circumstances and to give hope to people with difficulties.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
Evicted a busy farm where macro parties were held
The invaders had taken over 11 of the 13 floors of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the estate at noon yesterday without offering resistance.
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare lived by the neighbors of 51 of Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people left yesterday at noon voluntarily the property they occupied illegally, and where they organized macro parties that despaired the neighborhood, by court order and without the need for police intervention.
When the operation was finished, the door latch was changed to prevent the situation from repeating.
“There will be access control from now on,” the administrator said.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are inhabited - took all the electrical installation and part of the water, in addition to painting the walls and leaving waste of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the scene of crowded parties, which lasted up to two days and despaired the tenants.
Next to the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that since the building was occupied the business has fallen by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque points out that the invaders of the estate were unfair competition, as they sold the cups for three euros, while in the discotheque they are worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment venue had had to respond to noise complaints, while, according to him, the inconveniences are not caused by the customers of the discotheque, but by the inhabitants of the busy house and, above all, the attendees of the parties that were organized there, which had increased their frequency and intensity in recent weeks, according to the angry neighbors of the area.
The person in charge of the discotheque explained that the inconveniences were so great that he even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago he “forgives” the rent.
The Guardia Urbana also confirmed that in recent weeks it had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP in the city, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had claimed last week "immediately to dislodge the property to end the problems of coexistence and civility that produce the neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area."
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one floor of the building occupied, but over the last few months the squatters had been entering all the floors of the building and almost all the floors, and that in some there have even been robberies.
In this sense he added that, "it is necessary to end impunity and be forceful against the incivism that has been generated in the estate."
Also yesterday, the Mossos evicted a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m., police headed to 35 Mont-ral Street, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people accessing the building.
All four were arrested at the time.
Park or Mountain?
The architects agree on the opportunity of the call beyond controversy about fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-80s, at the height of the now-defunct Barcelona Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), this Administration printed some promotional cards from Collserola.
The pamphlet defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
What’s more, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with New York’s Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park was once again, in the imagination of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that are not oriented on the north-south axis but up (mountain) -down (sea).
Collserola’s qualification as a natural park leads to this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with wild boars in the role of the Yogi bear.
It was there until, in September, the city council convened a mega-competition consisting of 16 contests for so many other gates to Collserola.
A door leads to the idea of a park, no doubt.
Either that or someone wants to put doors to the field.
The question comes out on its own: Collserola, park or mountain?
The competition, both for its purely organizational aspect and for what it means to reflect on the city, is the topic of conversation among all the architects of Barcelona.
It’s almost a recurring theme to lay hands on when two members of this ancient caste of elect recognize each other in an elevator.
And this fact gives rise, precisely, to one of the few coincidences between what three Barcelona architects, and university professors, who have presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modól and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the coastal front "it becomes necessary" to discuss "the mountain front", since the speech of Ildefons Cerdà, that of the green apples, has not been carried out.
“It starts from the fact that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex", says the architect for whom the title of "Collserola gates" contains a "lexical trap": one should not think of them "like the accesses to a park, but the delimitation of areas where it is necessary to act".
Modul, as Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, calls the proposal an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Dangers derived from the "uncertainty that is today to project the public space" after the experience lived in the 80s and that had in the area of the Forum "his swan song".
The first fear is the very delimitation of frontiers on which it can be built.
“Limiting something is fixing the next step,” that is, its overtaking.
“We need to think about new urban planning tools, because the current ones [in reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)] can give rise to real disasters.”
More closely to the question, Modol believes that, to simplify, the Vallserola slope "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, not", for a purely topographical question.
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Collserola Board that "should not fall into a broken sack", although he appreciates the opportunity that the city council offers its guild to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe conduit that allows architects to enter the debate, but he "doubts" whether it is this technical profile that should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all right", he points out) that have had to be created: "Architects should be just a tool".
Bayona hints that the answer to the question that gives the title to this piece is complex, because the basis of the contest lacks a global vision of Collserola: "16 cross-sectional contests have been called," he says, "but there is no longitudinal reading, which sees and understands the area as a whole."
This means, at least in your case, that you have chosen to participate in all 16 contests.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors may clash in program and definition with that of the architect next door.
In his view, yes, the city council should ensure that the strip immediately above the Ronda de Dalt should provide, to its full extent, an area of equipment that would effect a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrazabal and will go free
After 72 days of rooting, the legal representative of the Casino Red granted forgiveness to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey of the process that was followed by alleged blackmail
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrazábal will be released after the legal representative of Casino Red grants him pardon before the Second Criminal District Court, which follows a blackmail lawsuit against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, made public a series of photographs and videos in which Manuel Jonas allegedly demanded the payment of an economic fee for the Regiomontano municipality to allow the clandestine operation of the bookmaker.
Following the public complaint, the state prosecutor’s office opened criminal proceedings against the mayor’s brother and on September 2 he was arrested and grounded for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Prosecutor 3 in Heritage Crimes, he was transferred to the House of Arraigo 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
There he remained for 49 days after he was given a second incarceration order after the Public Prosecutor dismissed the crimes of racketeering and organized crime.
On October 19 he was transferred to Cadereyta prison allegedly for blackmailing the owners of the Casino Red with 1.5 million pesos; however, he remained only a few hours in the medium-security inmate since there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to follow the trial interned in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, he was ordered apprehended by the secretary of the Second Criminal District Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that almost two months after the investigations, enough evidence was verified to determine the guilt of Jonas, such as the collection of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the bookmaker in exchange for allowing the operation of the same.
On Monday, Casino Red’s legal representative, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, went to the judge José Luis Pecina to ask for forgiveness for the mayor’s brother; so in the coming hours he could regain his freedom.
During the due diligence, the agent of the Public Ministry attached to the Court, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been repaired and which of the partners of the bookmaker was the one who granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
Based on file 197/2011 legal pardon is granted to Jonas Larrazábal and hereinafter no claim can be filed around the process that followed; in addition, no compensation for damages or punishment will be required.
Following the hearing with the bookmaker’s legal representative, Larrazabal Bretón was ordered to be released immediately at around 3:50 p.m.
The secretary of the court, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to notify Jonas that he has been legally pardoned and his file will be archived.
He will also notify you of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash where the Secretary of the Interior, Francisco Blake, and seven other people died.
The Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results released on the accident where the Secretary of the Interior, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven other people lost their lives, indicate that the helicopter was directly impacted on the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were suitable for flying.
"Elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the terrain, the blades had contact with trees 25 meters away where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so he had the necessary requirements to transport the personnel.
In addition, he said that research done in the impact area does not report the appearance of parts on the ground.
“In a search report that there are no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was presented structurally.
“The design of the helicopter was for 19 passengers, it had adequate requirements to carry passengers.
The terrain has a slope of seven degrees at 30 degrees of inclination.
At the moment, the secretary said that it is a priority to have the results as soon as possible; however, the investigation can last several months, even could reach a year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the time of the impact, the Presidential General Staff helicopter operated at cruise speed and that this happened in a soft upward terrain.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact," he said.
At the press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aeronautical regulations the flight was performed under visual flight rules, this implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
Reports at the AICM placed suitable conditions at take-off, as the aircraft advanced towards the border area between the DF and the State of Mexico presented layers of cloudiness at low altitude.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to cloudy conditions the crew has sought an area of lower elevation and greater visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of impact.
The impact coordinates and the radar aircraft's last record coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft wreckage in a small area:
The information available so far allows us to assume that the impact occurred on a straight and side path.
The pattern of dispersal of aircraft debris makes it possible to assume that the helicopter was impacted on the ground in conditions of structural integrity.
No evidence of fire or explosion has been detected:
At the site of the disaster there remains no evidence of any kind of explosion or fire on the remains of the ship.
The latest research results indicate that he may have had multiple contacts with the ground.
During fieldwork, parts of the aircraft have been found at an elevation of 9,200 feet above the average sea level, the terrain has a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was predictably disjointed along such a path.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After a thorough search in a wider area than the congested site, around the accident, no dispersed parts of the aircraft have been found, which strengthens the presumption that the impact occurred under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS Announces Obesity Gene Finding Protocol
Leads Social Security research to discover obesity gene in children and youth; is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that it is leading research to discover the obesity gene in children and young people, called the 'Childhood and Adolescence Obesity Genetics' protocol, which will allow markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital of Specialties of the Siglo XXI National Medical Center, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The research invites the participation of the population, whether rightful or not, to attend the participating sports units of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where the tests are carried out to minors, every Saturday from 8:00 am.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (State of Mexico West) and that since October 8, the activity is carried out in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (State of Mexico East).
Once the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors is met, the study will continue at the Unidad Deportiva Independencia (south of the Federal District) and finally at the Unidad Deportiva Morelos (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and importance of genetics with respect to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
As World Diabetes Day is being celebrated on November 14, the goal is to bring together 3,000 children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific questionnaires on food.
They will also be asked about physical activity and a family history of diseases, in order to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
Saturdays are applied to all participants anthropometric measurements (weight, size, waist circumference), blood pressure intake, determination of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin levels, and genetics (the aim is to identify genes that are associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López noted that this research is due to the concern of health professionals about the alarming weight gain in minors.
“The 1999 and 2006 health surveys indicated that in just six years there was an increase, in the case of boys, of 77 percent in obesity, and of girls of 47 percent; in terms of overweight a dramatic rise was also observed,” said the specialist of the IMSS.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers rests on the fact that the country’s population differs from others by its genetic history.
He reported that on average, the Mexican has 65 percent Indian American, 30 percent European and five percent African heritage and this condition is reflected in the genes that are associated with diabetes and excess weight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and that is stored in the form of fat.
The direct benefit to the participants is the comprehensive evaluation of the children, which allows to detect if they present any degree of overweight or obesity.
He even said the presence of dark-colored folds (acantosis) in the neck and forearm, which indicate the likelihood that he will suffer from metabolic alterations and even prediabetes.
The information is handled confidentially, doctors deliver it in writing to parents, who are told each of the measurements and lifestyle changes they must make to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentary lifestyle, which is the lack of daily physical activity, sitting most of the day in front of the TV and using means of transport instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to the high calorie intake, that is, the higher consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tapas, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) with high fat and protein content and genetics that are analyzed in this protocol.
Asphalt of UNAM would avoid bumps
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the UNAM School of Chemistry, develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals sent by the pavement were met, it would not be necessary to repair about 200,000 patches each rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, who said that if the process of construction and maintenance of an asphalt pavement is adequate, the patches could even be eliminated.
In his lecture A technological opinion of the bumps, dictated in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory in charge develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve its performance and, therefore, the formation of bumps.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, some of which are high molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and others of low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt consists in that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees Celsius its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees Celsius it has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform, but is modified during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, warned the chemical engineering specialist.
The FQ researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible pavement, which consists of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt folder, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the stones that make up the folder, he pointed out, is bathed in asphalt.
As vehicles travel and effort is generated, this allows the forces to diffuse very well on the pavement.
If it were modified asphalt, it would spread even better, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphalt folder, abounded, a last layer called rolling folder is placed, which is made of a fine stone material, that is, a sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer that will be in contact with the tires of the vehicles, it should have more mechanical force than the asphalt pad and provide friction on the road.
Being the part of the pavement that will receive and diffuse the efforts, the treadmill also requires having the right thickness and care must be taken of the material from which it is made.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects asphalt binder performance.
When the ground gets wet, the water diffuses inside the folder and it is difficult to get out, this causes a softening of all layers of the pavement and, therefore, the formation of bumps.
In the process of forming a bump, he said, the first one to wear out is the rolling film and only then the asphalt folder is affected, but the damage does not happen instantly, but it is a process that should be attended to at the first signs with proper maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Researchers explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of bumps and, therefore, the thickness of each of the layers of the pavement must always go in relation to the vehicle load and ensure that it is complied with, to avoid that bumps form frequently.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to research and work on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and allow to repair the bumps easily and without the need to use high temperatures.
What was missing from the candidate of the Valley to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that caused Melina Ramirez Serna to fail to reach the crown of Señorita Colombia.
The Valley receives its 14th title of princess.
Once again the Cauca Valley is left with the desire for the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for being on the podium of winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that credit her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico rose with the crown and the scepter, the department already adds 14 titles of Princess and Melina joins the legion of Vallejucan women who have been close to the crown but who were proclaimed princesses among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Arenala (1979),
The big question that many people ask themselves today is: What is missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite who in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was chosen Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie de Vogue, titles that obtained queens such as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the decision that the jury made to designate her First Princess is that she did not convince with her answer to the question "What is that book that has marked you and why?" made by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Leamos Literary Cart.
To the question, the valecaucana replied:
“I read a lot, I believe quite a lot in literature, I think it’s a way of culturalizing, I definitely think the book that marked me from childhood is ‘The Little Prince’, it’s a pretty deep book.
I am currently reading Crime and Punishment, it is a book of universal literature that we must all read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book that is called The Burning of Blood.
A response he did not like first for the term "culturalize" and second for not explaining in a specific way how each of the books he cited have marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise happens what has to happen.
And for all people, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book.
Among the hypotheses put forward, it is said that Valle burned the favoritism.
One Bogota journalist hinted that being the favorite, the cheerleader and the candidate who won all the preliminary awards (Oster gastronomy challenge, public vote for the best handcrafted costume, and Queen Mother), "that aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and therefore did not shine on stage."
And that was noticed in his first swimsuit performance on Hilton Beach and his two parades on the coronation evening.
Although he looked confident in both, it was noted that he lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantica did show.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist on RCN’s “Come Home” program, said that the fact that Melina was named a princess “proves that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the contest does not stay as queen.”
In addition, Valle showed himself to the last one very elusive with the press, and there he was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
For one thing, two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty said that they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of their country.
“Beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, we have to look beyond the physical and focus on their social sensitivity, that before entering the Contest they are already involved in projects,” she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned for her defects in the back and the fibrosis that was noticed in her abdomen, but it is contradictory because precisely the jury chose her as the candidate 'Natural beauty' with the healthiest body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queens trainer Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better, "but her problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, that the truth for me was not very noticeable, she dropped points on the last day".
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos considers that the mistake of vallacaucana were the surgical interventions that were practiced.
“The surgeries are fine, but Valle didn’t know how to do them.
Her body was never her forte and here she was charged.”
For this award, which for the first time presents the National Beauty Contest, after the parade in a swimsuit a cruel prediction emerged that last night was fulfilled, because it was said that this was the contentment that Raymundo granted to Melina to not give the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina starts today a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, position that gives her the possibility to represent Colombia in one of the international contests by designation of the National Competition itself.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming passage through Cartagena, evaded the crown.
This was the work of the caleño who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A lophoscopist from Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4, a lophoscopist from the Cali ITC went down in history as the man who confirmed the identity of the FARC’s top boss: “Alfonso Cano”, through the matching of his fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists working in the ITC section, Eliazar Gonzalez, a Puerto Tejada man who has been working in the judicial investigation area for 21 years, was on duty that week.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez worked in municipalities of the Chocó, where he often had to go to the jungle for more than five days to reach the place where the corpses were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after taking the corresponding courses, specialized in lofoscopy, which is the study of friction skin, that is, the palms of the hands and feet.
The week of the operation against the alias Alfonso Cano Eliazar was warned to wear minimum clothes for three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left for the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmyra.
He knew he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected of being the man leading the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he was asked to carry the decadactyl card of Guillermo Leon Saenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the site where the corpse was located, he did not recognize it by its physical appearance, as it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He was beardless, dressed like a local farmer, without glasses and much thinner.
But the footprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a transplanter, and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the corpse’s fingerprints to those of the card.
His eye did not fail: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of confirming to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was the FARC’s top chief.
In Search of the Footprint
For a Sijín de Cali typist, the recognition given by President Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar González at the press conference for the operation against “Cano” is very significant.
A lot of people don’t know about our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, with no margin for error, that can become key in solving crimes.
Apart from the identification of corpses, lophoscopists support investigations for crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When captured, many criminals have false ballots or no papers.
We take the fingerprint and look for them in the database.
The investigator said that, in a case of theft, it was up to him to remove a piece of wall from a house, because in that place the thief had supported his hand to take out a safe full of jewelry and money.
“The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to take a fingerprint, but in that case we were able to get the fingerprint of the whole hand and identify the offender, who had participated in different thefts,” he recalled.
The fingerprints can also rule out or reassert suspects in homicide cases.
They recently found a dead man, with bottles of liquor around him.
Through the investigation it was determined that a family member could be suspected of the crime and, indeed, a footprint on the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that he was the killer, it does place him at the crime scene.
A CTI fingerprinter explained that in objects "the fingerprints are taken with chemical or physical reagents."
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used to lift them.
After this, the prints are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.
“The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians,” the ITC expert said.
He clarified that not everything is as shown on the CSI television show.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything that is touched becomes a footprint.
However, if it can be used, if the respective matching is performed.
'Indignados' challenge authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters gathered in front of Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part attended to the eviction order and moved to a nearby paruqe.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged New York authorities on Tuesday as they tried to re-enter, under a court order, Manhattan Square from where they were evicted in the early hours and tried to occupy another Big Apple park.
Hundreds of protesters huddled in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to access thanks to a court order that allowed the “indignados” to return to camp at the site, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a park further north of the city, where there have been new arrests.
“Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again in the square, we will settle somewhere else and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through peaceful sittings and demonstrations,” said one of the spokesmen for the “Occupy Wall Street” movement, Mark Bray.
Bray said the “outrageous” response to the eviction from his camp personally dictated by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning the forced evacuation of the site and allowing protesters to remain encamped.
In addition, the "indignants" proceeded to occupy a new park located at the confluence of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, connecting New York and New Jersey, and owned by the Trinity Church Parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray could not confirm the specific figure, while assured Efe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization says that several hundred people had settled at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already moved to show support for the members of the movement and has tried to mediate with the police.
In the meantime, Zuccotti Square - which is a privately owned enclosure - is still closed pending the holding of a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday, in which the legality of the evacuation this morning must be analyzed.
Some of the demonstrators displaced there carried and distributed copies of that court order at this time and even handed them over to the agents guarding the square, which sparked “some small clashes,” Bray said, denouncing that some officers beat the demonstrators.
The court order prohibits authorities from evicting members of Occupy Wall Street or applying “laws that were published after the occupation began or prohibiting protesters from re-entering the park with shops or other properties they previously used.”
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that, because of that court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and protesters, who he warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to resettle with tents and sleeping bags.
The councilor personally defended the eviction carried out in the early hours of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which about 200 arrests were carried out and which was decided because the protesters were "violating the law".
Bloomberg said he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming “a place where people don’t come to protest, but to violate laws and, in some cases, harm others,” as “some businesses have received threats” and neighbors fear “for their quality of life.”
"The eviction this morning was disgusting and shows that at Bloomberg's bottom he is more interested in preserving the financial interests of American workers than he is in the interests of American workers," the spokesman for the movement added, accusing the mayor of "lacking respect for freedom of expression."
“Occupy Wall Street” officials also said they plan to organize “big actions” for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months of the protests, which began on Sept. 17.
Pamela Anderson to be the Virgin Mary in a Christmas TV special
Together with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1.
Canadian actress Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant on "Home Improvement," rescuer on "Baywatch," bunny of "Playboy," the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Christmas special from Canadian television.
Private TV channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with "crooner" Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 giving life to a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV distributed images of the TV show in which Anderson, also known for the widespread online distribution of a pornographic home video in which she appears along with her then-husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding in a manger a doll representing Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian descent who recently acted as host on part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as Jose.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, CTV’s Christmas special features Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and is no stranger to controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian a "fuck" during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the downward spiral that began in March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still recovering from the devastating earthquake that turned into a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe the Japanese country has suffered since World War II.
The Tokyo government’s first estimates put material losses at $300 billion, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, appears to have been mitigated.
After three consecutive quarters of declines, the figure for Gross Domestic Product between July and September was finally used to turn the page: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% in the annualized rate.
The second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year starts in March 2012 - also represents the highest rate of growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is explained, in part, by the resurgence of the purchase of machinery to restore the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% drop in capital spending that was observed from January to March, the first setback after six months of uninterrupted hikes.
However, the true revulsiveness of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse that invites us to take advantage of crises to strengthen - or rebuild - infrastructures, to use the shortcomings to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened, mainly thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable escalated by 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market, when the yen – the Japanese currency – has become one of the “safe haven values” chosen by investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the murky US forecasts, a privilege weighing like a slab on the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic buoyancy is determined by the health of large tech groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blamed their weak results between July and September on the yen's price.
As markets continue to besiege the EU’s peripheral countries, Yoshihiko Noda’s government does not let down its guard.
“We must be alert to the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Thailand’s floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen,” Motohisa Furukawa, Secretary of State for Economic Policy, said yesterday.
And, in fact, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said most member countries showed sharper signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates turning points in the world economy highlighted that major powers are slowing down.
It dropped four-tenths to 100.4 points, down from 100.8 in August.
The euro zone even fell below the 100 level average, dropping eight-tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens feeds back the doubts
Papadimos Says Adjustments Will Be Approved, But Conservatives Will Not Sign Any Written Commitment
With peripheral risk premiums soaring and uncertainty resettled in the parkets, Greece continues to entangle itself in the maze leading to the exit from the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the “consensus” of the new Hellenic transitional government is being imposed more by Brussels’ demands than by genuine conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed on in his appointment may be short to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he will not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections by the scheduled date, February 19.
“The main task of this government is to implement the decisions of the October 26 summit,” Papadimos said as he opened a parliamentary debate yesterday that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new Executive.
A package of 24 programs to boost employment, reform the civil servants’ disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras’ message does not clear doubts about his stance: “We have pledged to help the Transitional Government, but we have not committed to anything else.”
The conservative leader went one step further on his pulse to the EU and the IMF, the bodies that must unlock the $8 billion Athens urgently needs, and made clear that he will not give his approval to any commitment letter to comply with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still driven by the impact of the Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said the troika inspectors would return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government "what it takes to pay the sixth tranche" of $8 billion, although there is no definitive date either.
The Greek mulch still has thread for a while.
Doña Sofía: "They are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights the "preponderant" place of Spain in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a leading place globally in the role of microfinance".
Queen Doña Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become in the last two decades the second donor of the proposal in relation to this instrument of cooperation, whose "essence" indicated that it lies in being an "instrument for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen inaugurated the 5th World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that such operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations with the 2015 horizon, and "especially in those who have the goal of reducing to half the volume of people living with daily incomes of less than one thousand people".
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and takes on this task with "responsibility", said Doña Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originate from the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women", main beneficiaries of these loans.
There are “many achievements” and “many challenges we face.”
The Microcredit Summit is seen not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which to push “two basic goals”.
Her Majesty explained that by the end of 2015 it is expected that 175 million poor families will have access to these financial services and that one hundred million of these households will be beyond the poverty line at which they are plunged.
The momentum in the conception of microcredits in Spain and in the rest of the world "has followed the path begun years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, highlights Doña Sofia as an "act of justice and due recognition".
He described the father of this tool as an “admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty”, whose work he has known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all I have been able to see the continuous evolution", explained Her Majesty, whose link with this project earned him yesterday the title of "head of the family" gathered in Valladolid by the "cowboy of the poor".
Finally, Queen Doña Sofía concluded her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for every democratic state.
In this regard, he stated that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic bonanza, since it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez said microcredit is “a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty,” and now “more than ever” governments in developed countries must work on solidarity criteria and not let it fall victim to cutbacks.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
For her part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to the people "excluded to whom everyone closes the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present to a city that "opens its doors infected with the spirit of solidarity."
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, has passed without great difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian Democratic Party.
Initially, the future of Europe had not been included on the agenda, but the issue was imposed in the fall, particularly to satisfy militants who consider the government’s policy is currently too little stringent with the Greeks and could be so in the future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine votes were against and ten abstentions.
The multi-minute standing ovation won by Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the europhile Finance Minister, clears any possible doubt.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, is summed up in a motto: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because “nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro.”
For the Chancellor, “the time has come to pave the way for Europe.”
This could manifest itself in amendments to the Lisbon Treaty to allow the European Union to tighten its control over the budgetary policies of euro area countries, although it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "give a face to Europe".
In any case, that is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by Congress, clearly Wolfgang Schäuble’s idea.
Undoubtedly, it is unlikely that the 27 will quickly come to an agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and CDU leaders seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is too.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, the delegates rejected by a crushing majority the proposal to weight the weight of each country of the European Central Bank directive according to the weight of each economy, which would obviously strengthen the weight of Germany.
Eager to calm the mood inside her party, the Chancellor has increased references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but neither has she tried to win her congress at the expense of the “small” European countries or the countries in difficulty willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe devotes a section to the importance of “the Franco-German friendship”, Angela Merkel has not lied to France.
Saved from passing.
Two centuries ago, there was a bloody battle in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon’s army.
The incidence of fraud in sick leave
After the grants, the UMP and the government embark on an offensive against sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to visit a box responsible for family subsidies and deliver a speech on the topic, already recurring since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and aid.
In addition, to accompany such an offensive, which starts from the will to save rigorously, but still reminds of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, most want to focus on sick leave.
First, to implement budget cuts: the government plans to impose a fourth day of absence on private sector workers before they can take the plunge.
In short, unless there is a specific company agreement, a worker who falls ill would lose four days of salary, that is, a minimum of 15% of his monthly income.
It is a measure that could raise a wave of anger, but would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: imposing on officials a day of absence without pay in case of unemployment (so far, they have no shortage, compared to the three days that apply in the private sector).
While these issues are being debated, the majority again put the issue of fraud on the table, this time oriented towards the abuses of unemployment.
"Controls are going to increase considerably and, moreover, if someone is found committing fraud, they will have to reimburse the amounts," Xavier Bertrand told RTL on Sunday, Nov. 13.
As in the other cases, the effects of the announcement appear to be slightly disproportionate to the reality of unemployment fraud.
In fact, since 2002 this issue has been constantly monitored and a number of political offensives have been launched, which have usually borne fruit.
The French are no more sick than in the rest of Europe.
Let us look at the national figures first.
According to the French Social Security Institute (CNAM), in 2006 more than 237 million euros were paid in unemployment benefits.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, in 2008, subsidies for casualties accounted for 5% of health expenditure, amounting to 11.3 billion euros.
Of this sum, 46% corresponds to maternity and accidents at work, while 54% is related to sick leave, a figure that amounts to 6.2 billion euros.
Therefore, 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, French people took an average of 14.5 days off work, up from 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
Another survey, published in 2007 by Syrian professional management Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken a single day off sick.
Another study, in this case of the Health Insurance, indicates that in 2010 37% of sick leave lasted less than 8 days, 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% were longer.
If we compare them to our European neighbors, French workers are no more likely than in other areas to take sick leave.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall absentee rate (both for health and other reasons) in France ranged from 10% to 11%, compared to 20% to 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK or between 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Sick leave fraud is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
Fraud has a very limited scope.
Strengthening legislation since 2002 has resulted in systematic checks on sick leave of more than 45 days.
In 2008, of 1.5 million inspections, the CNAM verified, in 13% of the 285,000 carried out, that the short-term casualties were "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of casualties of more than 45 days, subjected to systematic inspections, it was considered that 11% of the cases were "duly adapted or unjustified; a figure that, starting from a total of 1.2 million, amounts to 132,000.
As a result, a total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases are reached among several million workers who took sick leave.
No doubt, an insignificant figure in comparison, for example, with black work.
According to UMP deputy Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent tax revenue losses of between 9,000 and 15 billion euros per year, that is, more than the total cost of subsidies for casualties and, undoubtedly, considerably more than fraud in the latter area.
Papademos: Greece must implement a new adjustment plan
Greece is going to need a new adjustment plan to straighten its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos declared before Parliament on Monday, November 14; he also added that the hundred days that have been granted to his Government of Union would not be enough to achieve this goal.
“To make efforts that lead to the recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment program,” said the Head of Government, who delivered his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the confidence vote in Parliament on Wednesday.
Execution of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October will be the “main task” of the new government, as “the country’s stay in the euro zone is at stake,” he added.
As a result, Papadémos has predicted that the country’s public deficit will be reduced “to around 9%” of GDP by the end of the year, reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The Right Rejects New Austerity Measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right-wing group, on Monday expressed his support for the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis, but has warned that his party will not commit to additional austerity measures.
“We will not vote for further measures,” he said during a meeting with his New Democracy party MPs.
He said he agreed with the goals of deficit and debt reduction, as well as the fight against waste, but against any policy that impedes economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary 8 billion euro loan without a written guarantee of all parties’ support for the planned measures, Antonio Samaras has responded that his word would suffice and that he would not sign anything due to external pressure.
Committee of Experts Says Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide Must Be Legalized
Canadians Live Denying Death, Royal Society of Canada Report Says
When it comes to palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not just in cancer cases.
Canadian society is denying death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions they want to die in and make arrangements for that.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, with the participation of six experts from various fields, including ethics, legal and medical.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Penal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient is considering such an option and has been judged competent to make the decision.
To begin with, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada ranks tenth, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to address the issue of death.”
With or without medication, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And even though most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in hospital.
Overall, the highest rate in this sense is Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in the hospital.
With regard to the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report came to conclusions that do not coincide with the position of the federal government, which has already declared that it does not want to modify the Penal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offense, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offense has not led to an abuse of their application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with persons who are not competent or who have not given their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, more excesses were observed in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
"In Canada, euthanasia is practiced, although it is clearly illegal."
"Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians support euthanasia
Remember that 85% of Canadians have already spoken out in favor of euthanasia, as they believe it would allow people whose death is on the verge of alleviating their suffering, according to a 2010 Angus Reid survey.
In addition, 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not imply that the lives of elderly or disabled people have less value.
As for people who have practiced assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believe that a lawsuit should not be initiated against them.
Regarding the maintenance or interruption of health care to a patient, the situation is not so clear, the authors of the report indicate.
In addition, his recommendations suggest that the Penal Code should indicate that the withdrawal of health care, if legally refused, does not constitute a criminal offence.
The Committee of Experts also calls for health professionals to be trained in the duty to respect the fact that a patient refuses care at the end of his life without fear of facing a complaint.
When it comes to palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not just in cancer cases.
Finally, in relation to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the committee requests that, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, it be considered as euthanasia and undergo the same procedures.
Other experts express reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations regarding the conclusions of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has called the position of the experts signing the report "extreme", among other things because the practice of euthanasia is not limited to terminally ill patients.
“This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is tired of living and over 18 years old can ask for help to commit suicide,” said Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value in society.
He added, “In society, there are labels and limitations.”
Health law expert Margaret Somerville also expressed her “strong opposition” to the report’s findings, which she called “a manifesto in favor of euthanasia.”
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, especially calls into question the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan's King Urges President Assad to Leave Power
Damascus denounces "complot"
Syria is increasingly isolated.
The partisans of Bashar El Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, the diplomatic pressure on Syria intensified from Bashar El-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, resists it and denounces that there is a “conspiracy” against the country.
Two days after the Arab League’s suspension of Syria, the European Union has tightened sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, Syria’s neighbors, have spoken out in favor of President Assad’s abandonment of power.
Jordan’s King Abdullah II was the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar Assad to “abandon power” in Syria, where some 40 civilians and members of the regime’s forces have already died.
“If Bachar really cares about his country, he should step down and create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life,” the King of Jordan, Syria’s neighbor, said in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that Turkey’s mediation efforts with the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year have ended in failure.
“Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their people and cannot satisfy them will leave,” he said, referring to Syria, a neighboring country in which Turkey is taking an increasingly harsh stance.
Following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States has welcomed the "strengthening of consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime".
“The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are adopting an increasingly harsh tone” regarding the crackdown in Syria, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime’s forces have already been killed in the southern Syrian region of Deraa, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) has announced.
Two other civilians have died "during bombings and heavy machine gun fire in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, the NGO said.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al Mualem said the country was “moving towards the end of the crisis.”
In addition, he has reacted strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its functions, which in his opinion constitutes "a dangerous step".
Syria “will not weaken,” he added, guaranteeing that “the plots plotted against Syria will fail.”
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a “civilian protection mechanism” and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé has also expressed his support for sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the regime’s repression, which he believes is entrenched in “paranoia.”
A further extraordinary meeting of the League is expected tomorrow in Rabat to finalise the implementation of the crisis exit plan adopted on 2 November, which envisages, in particular, the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities that are in the hands of the opposition and the release of the detained protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said yesterday that the Arab League's decision was "incorrect", while China urged Syria to implement the exit plan, although it did not express its support for the implementation of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti asks for time from markets and sacrifices from Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to form his team and launch a program that will include “sacrifices” aimed at recovering the credibility lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner discussed yesterday with the political parties and today met with the trade unions and the employers.
It should form a relatively restricted cabinet, made up of technocrats outside parliament.
"Monti has spoken of a broad program with numerous sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a deputy from one of the plentiful small parliamentary groups that participated in the meetings, having met with the designated Council President.
Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Gianfranco Fini said he hoped that Mario Monti would ask for a vote of confidence in parliament before Friday to ensure that the new government had enough support.
The consultations will end with the presentation, by Mr. Monti, of a limited list, undoubtedly of a dozen Ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti has commented on the nervousness of stock markets and bondholders yesterday, asking for time.
In “democracy, there are precise deadlines” for forming a government and preparing its program, he said, adding that he is “sure that the markets will have patience and understand it.”
His appointment by the President initially received the approval of the markets, but then uneasiness prevailed, particularly after an unforeseen drop in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The designated Prime Minister should create a team primarily made up of technocrats, even if he has stressed that he would like to include “politicians.”
The new government will have to work until 2013, the date of the next legislative elections, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will get the vote of confidence from Parliament before Friday.
Monti has pledged that when he takes office, he will work taking into account the urgency and with the aim of Italy "regaining its protagonism" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn said: “Even with a new government, it will not change our diagnosis of the Italian economy.
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal of achieving a budget balance in 2013 despite austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for further stringent measures.
Italian chief Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him, also insisted on the need to boost the economy, “because a country that does not grow cannot meet the deficit requirements.”
Monti, famous for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of era" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism"; the "teacher" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the editorialists.
The biggest unknown will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, since Italy has to place some 200 billion euros in state bonds before April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran on the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specializing in atomic risk said on Monday.
For the identification of the researcher, the Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by that agency.
The IAEA said last week it was "seriously concerned" about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to ISIS, based extensively on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades, since the 1960s, at a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) and participated in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the center to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamonds" in Kiev.
His company’s economic problems would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
It is then believed to have cooperated with the Iranian program between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentions that there are “clear indications that Iran is developing” a nuclear detonation system “with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique well, but also, as one member state has reported to the Agency, worked for most of its career on such technology in its home country’s military nuclear program.”
Crimes against Muslims have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by nearly 50 percent between 2009 and 2010, while, over the same period, other types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, according to statistics released by the FBI on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence committed against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, that is, it has increased by 49%, compared to a 13% increase in acts of violence against Catholics, a 4% reduction in crimes against Jews and a 14% overall increase in the number of crimes and anti-religious crimes.
The total number of “hate crimes” has risen slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% are due to racial and 20% to religious differences, the FBI said.
“After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that these types of crimes have increased again,” the human rights organization Human Rights First said, “the increase in violence against Muslims is especially significant.”
"Human Rights First has long pointed out that violence against Muslims, as well as all types of hate crimes, should be considered a serious human rights violation," said Paul Legendre, a senior official at the organization.
“The U.S. government can and should strive to end such abuses,” he added, adding that such efforts could include an improvement in police reporting on “hate crimes.”
The “hate crime” in U.S. federal law was inherited from the era of the civil rights struggle.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to race, skin color, religion, origin and, now, sexual inclination.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
Microblogging site Twitter on Monday modified the presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, which causes its service to look a little more like Facebook.
A new “activity” tab and another so-called “name” tab allow you to more readably and lively track the activity of other “Twittos”, that is, of those Internet users whose messages (“tweets”) follow on the Internet or who follow you.
This lets you know if they track messages, subscribe to new accounts, qualify as favorites some messages, etc.
The new Twitter formula was tested “with a small percentage of users in August” before it was released to the rest of the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to forward a message from another person, followfriday to recommend following another user) making the happiness of insiders, thus opens up to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of the mainstream networks Facebook and Google+.
On the net, users have debated the interest of this innovation with different opinions.
“It’s useless, it’s invasive, and it looks too much like Facebook,” writes ?jemb123.
“The Activity feature is going to help me better follow some elements of my Twitter stream,” writes Dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a budgetary "golden rule" in the Constitution
The government of the large Social-Democratic/Christian-Democratic coalition that is in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a budgetary “golden rule” to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid a possible degradation of Austria’s sovereign banknote by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when Austria’s public debt reached 74.6%, a figure well above the 60% ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency were to be reduced by one level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay 3 billion euros more in interest each year,” said Michael Spindelegger, deputy Christian Democratic foreign minister.
Austria responds to a request from the Brussels Summit to member countries of the euro area on 26 October: in it, the Heads of State and Government called for the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in a law with equivalent value.
The device adopted by the Austrian government approximates the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt this type of "rule".
Before 2017, the structural public deficit should decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, from 2017, the federal state’s structural public deficit should not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states, as well as communes, should present balanced budgets.
The goal is that by 2020/2021, public debt will be reduced under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
A strong yen
Noda threatens new foreign exchange market intervention
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would again intervene to mark the change if the yen continued to rise.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we find that excessive volatility occurs" in the yen's exchange rate, Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen was rising to levels close to the all-time highs that resulted in the Japanese authorities’ intervention on Oct. 31.
On that day, Tokyo massively sold yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the U.S. currency.
But the yen has been slowly picking up since then, driven by investor purchases that see it as a “safe haven value” in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar was quoted again on Tuesday at less than 77 yen and the euro has fallen below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, reaching levels close to those that caused the last intervention.
Prior to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was trading at around 120 yen and the euro at more than 160 yen.
This explosion of Japanese currency hurts exports of the archipelago, as it costs Made in Japan products and reduces the value of the income earned abroad by Japanese companies when they convert them to the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild itself" following the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, which devastated the northeastern Tohoku region, Noda said, fearing the yen's steepening cut-off from the weak recovery.
The world’s third-largest economy has regained growth in the third quarter (1.5 percent compared to the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the prime minister believes that the high level of the yen did not reflect Japan’s “economic bases.”
Finance Minister Jun Azumi has called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all possible steps to weaken the yen.
However, the institution's deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures", hinting that greater monetary flexibility should not be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institute increased its purchases of Treasury Letters by five trillion yen (47 billion euros), bringing the threshold of funds it devotes to the acquisition of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market to 55 billion yen (519 billion euros).
Eurozone:
Guys grow, bags weaken
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis continues to hurt European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, rates in the weakest countries continue to rise.
Still worried about the stability of the euro area, European exchanges plunged a little further into the negative zone on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 loses 1.4% and stands at 3,064 points.
The Dax lost 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
“Given the new strains on lending yields from the most affected euro area states, stock markets around the world continue to yield some of their recent gains.”
“Investors, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of contagion,” Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, told Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed with a drop of 0.7%, renewing concerns from market players about Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has its gaze fixed on Europe and the exchanges will continue to be carried out within a narrow range of variations, so investors will have no evidence that the situation has stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The resurgence of concerns about the future of the euro area is affecting the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro remains at its lowest level since a month and a half ago.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1.3570, a fall of 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it has lost value after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party, the CDU, which met Monday in Congress, adopted a motion that envisages, in particular, the option of a country in difficulty leaving the euro zone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far exceed 6%
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield on Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, while Spanish bonds at the same time offered 6.2%.
These tensions in relation to the interest rates of the countries of the south, but also of France, continue to fuel the fears of the interveners.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for time to improve the situation in Italy, which is at risk of choking on the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, has said that the implementation of the decisions adopted at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October would be the “main work” of his government.
Spain is in the spotlight of the markets, while on Sunday the legislative elections will be held there.
The spread between 10-year bonds in Germany and Spain has reached a new all-time high.
Waiting for growth figures in the euro area
From a statistical point of view, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, a more favourable figure than the 0.3% forecast, driven by domestic consumption.
Insee, however, has revised down the second-quarter figure, with a 0.1% reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In addition, the fourth quarter is the one that really worries economists.
Germany, for its part, recorded growth of 0.5% in the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are expected at 11 a.m., after the European Commission warned of the risk of a further recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must be worth more than dogmas
If there’s one issue that can’t be addressed with short-term considerations or just thinking about emotions, it’s energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influences the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is appropriate that an electoral meeting is the time to reflect on such issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it examines the full range of economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic evolution will mean doubling electricity demand by 2050, unless a huge portion of the world’s population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the growing shortage of fossil resources will have to be alleviated in order to continue producing electricity continuously, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not alter any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to give up nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which submits its own to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, nor in Switzerland, which only aims to build state-of-the-art power plants.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name a few examples, are moving forward with determination with their projects.
The United States, on the other hand, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, restarting the construction of a power plant interrupted after the accident of Three Mile Island.
If the German model, based on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality goes against such a discourse.
The election of Berlin will mean a higher price of electricity, a greater energy dependence on the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions from the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, the detrimental effects will be noticed.
The case of Denmark should be considered.
Europe’s champion in the wind sector, from which it obtains 30% of its electricity, is also one of the major users of coal and gas due to the intermittent wind; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are, respectively, 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbors pay an electricity bill 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For that reason, any significant reduction in nuclear power would mean a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would detract from the wonderful statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of our purchasing power.
This is a price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and, in fact, do not express opposition in principle to this type of energy, according to the surveys.
Let us remember that our country’s energy policy has lost the construction of an industrial sector with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Widely export-oriented, it encompasses a galaxy of SMEs that specialize in international markets and can create non-delocalizable jobs.
If France decided to abandon nuclear power, it would mean the sacrifice of much of these SMEs and the loss of 6 billion euros a year in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician would charge an EPR designed to run sixty years, when its manufacturer is expected to collapse?
To solve the equation of nuclear energy, one must admit that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, just as there is no diabolical source.
Areva’s development of low-CO2, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have a Safety Authority that exercises strict and transparent control over both existing plants and the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, of recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with safety.
In half a century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, was produced under normal operating conditions; it caused no consequences for people or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and unforgivable human failures.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of unprecedented scope, which resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it did from the previous two.
Thanks to these advances and to a cooperation between the security authorities, and the French and German operators and builders, the EPR presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is studied by all the electric players who want to build a power plant, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, since it would leave them free rein to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy applied by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized starting from various points of view: the saturation of the police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of figures, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "country of human rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has jumped the headlines, with the Minister of the Interior (see the newspaper Libération of 23 May) proclaiming in the past that France "does not need foreign talents, workers or waiters".
However, it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
The point is that, on this issue, there is quite a bit of consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the orientation by declaring in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country that has about two million immigrant workers", while on the left, the tone was set by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot take care of all the misery in the world" in 1990.
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, both the left and the right shared the fear of invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish plumbers.
On both sides, immigrants are considered to be a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity with which they act with respect to immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande merely includes trivialities, indicating that the co-development will solve the “migration problem”.
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, is perhaps profitable electorally, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent paper summarizing the latest insights on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries.
Limiting immigration weakens growth and hurts employment.
Fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace domestic workers, particularly the low-skilled, by pushing for their wages to be reduced.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are more complementary than substitutes for domestic workers and practice mainly in jobless sectors.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract domestic workers and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand for personnel.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country that lacks anesthesiologists, the complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes the arrival of the latter to positively influence the salaries and employment of nationals.
Taking into account the above, Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in migration flows means a rise in long-term real wages of between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And, regardless of the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel laureates and companies such as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, as they contribute on average 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant who arrives at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (income minus expenses) of 150,000 euros to the average public budgets throughout his or her life.
At the beginning of his term, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go find the growth points that he lacked "with his teeth".
These teeth, which deterred immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, we just need to think about a European democracy
Democracy is a precious good, but also a fragile one.
The European continent should be able to remember this since, although it was invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, throughout the twentieth century it has suffered the tragedies of the World War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that in order for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies, it would be sufficient to exercise the vote and in the most direct way possible.
We know, since Napoleon "the Little One", that it was something thought of.
Universal suffrage, while a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough on its own and can even become an “instrument of oppression,” as the former Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we are experiencing in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinody of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this regard, a twofold revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return of the political sphere, but also the worrying feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
You need to think about this ambivalence to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now shifted and that, in many cases, Republican soldiers are no longer moving in the right direction.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and in a disorderly way.
A blank signature on the absolute European monarch or a halt to the vacuum of the nationalist hole: what choices for the citizen!
No, we do not want to take blows, but a common, full-fledged, calm and continuous exercise of options and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where to end the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis of Europe.
The whole of Europe is the one that bends to the orders of the markets and the rating agencies, the one that suffers from its helplessness and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that suffers a humiliation in the international sphere.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is all of Europe that slowly loses its sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
What is most urgent is that popular sovereignty regains the helm of the European project.
Only together can Europeans reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare their future through investments.
The exit from the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to disaster.
After having long fought against this proposal from the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for European economic governance.
Let it be so.
But thinking about it without greater political and democratic integration, and without it being lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and would take us to a new deadlock.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" Republicans.
Interest-driven revolution would not be enough.
This lesson remains applicable.
We must build a more integrated Europe from an economic point of view.
It can only be achieved by building a more democratic Europe at the political level, a true European people's sovereignty.
To build Europe, let’s make it European.
Cards with "contactless" chip are generalized
The World Chip Card Show kicks off Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
In fact, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global sales of cards with microprocessors (bank cards, phones with SIM cards, etc.), with a total of 6 billion units, according to calculations by the Eurosmart office.
The most powerful segment is the contactless technology, which allows you to pay for transportation or shopping simply by bringing the card closer to a reader.
This year 460 million contactless chip cards will be sold worldwide, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its share is expected to continue to increase in 2012 (580 million units) and account for about 10% of the global chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe, long lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the contactless payment sector.
About 26 million Visa bank cards already have this feature, which is accepted in 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, its beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards are being used.
But large areas work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Pass cards this year.
To get ahead, however, banks need to make them available to their customers.
“There are two large French establishments that have committed to systematically spreading contactless bank cards among their customers in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, general manager of Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile payment
But it’s just a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Currently, there are few devices equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, which is essential for making transactions.
"They're resting."
“But it should finally experience a real boom next year.”
“We expect between 80 million and 120 million units to be sold worldwide in 2012,” explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the lead.
Bank Crédit Agricole announced the launch of a test between December and June in Caen.
The iPhones of around 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale has also stated yesterday that it is preparing the commercialization of an offer that allows its customers to pay contactless through their mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris worries about ties between al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The links between the al Qaeda terror group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram, over which they had long been suspected, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even claimed that Algiers already “has the certainty”.
"The way both organizations operate and intelligence reports show that they are cooperating," he said, without providing further details.
Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two French men in Niger last January reportedly resumed.
Kidnapped at a restaurant in Niamey by people related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the next day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators discovered several phone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist Axis
The study of the calls made indicates to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers particularly caught the interest of the researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who stayed for a long time in Maiduguri, a northern Nigerian city, birthplace of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who, supposedly, is close to Aqmi and the sect.
“This is progress, but we must certainly wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
“We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and is becoming increasingly active,” said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, such "supports" had become increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in his operational modes, which now involve the use of increasingly complex kamikazes or explosive devices of the same style as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since been pressuring Abuya to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, have long regarded the group as an unworthy enlightened community.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (meaning, in Hausa, "Western education is a sin"), incites the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes itself and demands strict respect for sharia law, while its militants launch themselves into the fight against the ungodly central government.
The latter are primarily oriented to churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were especially active and attacks on police stations increased.
Abuya’s reaction was, as is often the case, widespread.
The army attacked the city and 800 people were killed.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested while alive, is killed in prison.
Since then, the sect has radicalized and abandoned its northern fiefdoms.
Last Christmas, he claimed an attack that killed 80 people in Jos and then another in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram again attacks Abuya, in particular against the protected police headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations becomes its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, spanning from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, worries all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and Al-Shebab Somalis operate in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to "share all the information".
The World According to Republican Presidential Candidates
Regarding China, Iran and aiding Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry rival in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
Can an America weakened by crisis manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican candidates for the presidential election, voters might think so.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have been making more and more thunderous statements and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a strong point of Republicans.
Slogans, often unfounded, spread over China, Iran, aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the race for the “Great Old Party” designation, has threatened to take the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them “for manipulating their currency,” a key issue in an America exasperated by the migration of entire fragments of their sector to Asia.
It doesn’t matter if that involves the explosion of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate with a sophisticated view of foreign policy, almost drowns in an attitude that “depresses” emotions.
He has called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who remains stuck in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
In the style of Reagan
Romney has also pledged military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to disrupt its nuclear program.
“If I get elected, I’ll stop Iran,” he bragged.
“If Obama gets re-elected, they’ll have the bomb.”
He also vowed to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second-highest-ranked candidate, shows an embarrassing disregard for such topics.
Recently, he urged countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing “attempts to develop nuclear capability,” apparently ignoring the fact that China has already had the military atom since 1964.
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he is willing to deploy the U.S. military to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president counter that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remember that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to loosen the piston when it came to fighting terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naive dialogue with Iran, the hasty departure of the “boys” from Iraq and their misrepresentations in Libya, and label it weak.
But the attacks are not easy.
The population judges Obama’s national security balance, which ended bin Laden, rather positively.
From Iraq, he is wary of military interventions that lead to a collapse.
And, arguing that America needs to be economically rebuilt to resurrect its leadership, Obama gives the impression of being fairer.
Nord Stream, the new gateway for Russian gas to Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which directly connects Western Europe with Russia via the Baltic Sea floor, has already been put into service.
It must supply gas to meet the needs of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, took part in the opening of Nord Stream, the new gas pipeline that communicates directly, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart from the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, have turned together the steering wheel of the valve that controls the entry of Russian gas into the Western European grid.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 million cubic meters of Russian gas will arrive to Western Europe each year through a first 1,224 km pipeline connecting the St. Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second pipeline is expected to be completed by the end of 2012 to supply a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, enough to cover all French consumption.
In addition, we are already talking about the possibility of building a third tube along the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge work has the air of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries had strongly opposed the project.
In fact, Nord Stream will allow gas to be supplied directly to Germany, avoiding land travel by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries lose some of their power: for them, it will be harder to influence Russia by threatening to shut it off from Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting the Russian project, has achieved greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of the energy Europe, as the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has managed, in just five years, to triumph over its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, large consumers of gas and with increasingly limited reserves.
“This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that organically unites us,” François Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of the pipeline, demonstrating the extent to which large contracts in the gas sector are as political as they are economic.
All of this explains the wide smiles on the faces of Gazprom executives, numerous in Lubmin, at the gas arrival point.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The underwater tube is made of cement-coated steel to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from World War II.
"It was necessary to remove or destroy a hundred of them, as a precaution," said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to implement measures to protect fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs like 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted throughout its length: neither by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned in Sweden’s waters, but project leaders gave up on it when they saw that the Swedes were not very willing to allow a Russian state society to be permanently established at sea off their shores.
“In the event of a breakdown, we will interrupt the passage of the gas in less than a minute,” says Jens Müller.
In case of leakage, the gas from the pipeline will therefore be released into the atmosphere.
But the builders consider it unlikely that a leak will occur, as they have predicted junctions that will have a leak every 100,000 years.
Control of the state of the pipeline is ensured by a submarine robot, carried out by a ship, which carries out external inspections, as well as by a device that circulates inside the pipeline.
In the form of a pure, it is introduced into the inside of the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, it provides accurate data on possible metal deformations.
The pipeline has been designed to run for fifty years without any need for repair.
The circulation of the gas is ensured simply by the pressure.
At the beginning it is 200 bars and at the exit of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the stakes.
It was joined by the Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased to the company, for a period of twenty-five renewable years, all gas transmission capacities.
“Gazprom will pay for the full capacity, regardless of how much gas is actually transported,” Müller said.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline has been carried out by 30% with the contribution of the shareholders and by 70% through bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach 7.4 billion euros for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident they won’t outperform their investment, as Gazprom takes the risk of spending on its own.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic at Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted with pine trees.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the gas exit door.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas on arrival, before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people back the taste for writing.
It has an air of adventure, from hours of writing to the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognized, with its black rectangular pastes, its rubber, its broken white leaves, as if aged by the time.
However, Moleskine notebooks with the current look were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at that time to launch a notebook of design notes, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, was in charge of the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an ancient production technique, the mole skin, which refers to a varnished cotton that was used, among other things, to cover the benches.
This type of notebook was highly valued by writers and travelers.
“Moleskine has adapted an old and forgotten object to the current taste, an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century,” says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become responsible for the brand in Mode Mode.
And he achieved success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26 percent to 12.7 million units sold.
Far away was the confidential production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the buyer’s profile, since the notebook attracts businessmen as well as students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultured.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees at the beginning, now has about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
He distributes his notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to the small shops in the city centre, and has been able to impose his identity.
“We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the rise of emails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural firm goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, he also released a notebook with leopard covers, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified its products: handbags, agendas, pens, computer cases... The brand covers a wide range of supports.
A success that provokes envy: in autumn 2006, Mode Mode was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate for disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
The XV Week for Disabled Employment begins today.
Despite a resolute public policy, implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people doubles the average rate: 19%, compared to 9% for the entire population.
Discouraging?
“No,” says Éric Blanchet, general manager of Adapt, the association that organizes disability employment week.
"The progress made over the last fifteen years is considerable.
“At the time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
“However, there is still a lot to do.”
It should be noted that the unemployed with disabilities continue to face numerous barriers to accessing employment.
They are usually older: 37% are over the age of 50 (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% have not finished high school and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread among them: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average.
That is, there are numerous issues that make it especially difficult to return to the world of work and that "constitute the crux of the problem," says Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Those are the objective obstacles.
In addition, there are those who are not mentioned; the mentality of people is advancing, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entrepreneur association for the Cité noted that the directors surveyed have "a low level of knowledge about disabilities", with an "excessive representation of people in wheelchairs, physical or intellectual disabilities".
The result: Private companies with more than 20 workers are far from the target of hiring 6% disabled workers, which was set in a 1987 law.
According to the latest available figures, dating from 2008, they reach a ratio of 2.6%.
"We now reach around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the body responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not respect this law.
The test: the number of establishments "subject to this contribution", as well as the amounts disbursed, have decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 law, which increased contributions, has created a lot of pressure for businesses,” explains Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also reflects real awareness, particularly among large groups.”
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of companies with 20 to 49 workers have disabled employees, compared to 82% of companies with 100 to 199 workers.
Hazard: "A Joy"
About to face the Bleus on Tuesday night (20:45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure that this friendly match generates for them.
We will not dare to say that there was connivance between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other on the podium of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really made peace.
Five months after his striker’s grudge against Turkey, the Belgian coach has nothing but praise for him.
“I was very happy for Eden, for his progress and for being Belgian.”
"I want to move forward," replied the Lille striker.
As for the contrast between his performances in his team and in the selection, "it's a whole", it has been justified.
“In Lille, I’m all year, which doesn’t apply to Belgium.
"I have to sit down."
Called to play against Romania on Friday night, considering this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "shine".
Let’s not forget the “pleasure”.
He has been cheering on the Bleus since he was seven, as well as during the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been his fan,” he says.
This will, of course, reinforce the “particular” character of the meeting.
Especially because he will face “Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami),” he recalls.
“We just faced each other recently.
“Playing against them is always a joy.”
Leekens has simply made reference to “pride.”
"Pride" for playing "a gala match."
"I'm also proud to see, as a "neighbor", that France "returns to being a very high-level team", about a year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Blanc has done a formidable job," he said enthusiastically.
While Belgium will not be attending the next European competition, the coach would be delighted to be able to share planes with the Bleus towards... Brazil, in 2014.
“Our little Belgians are growing,” he said.
“We’re building something; the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.
"You'll be able to see it in the next matches." Including the match against France.
Portugal Shows Much Confidence
Paulo Bento’s Portugal faces with great optimism the return match against Bosnia (22:00), which will be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the one-way game, both teams lacked realism.
“When these 90 minutes pass, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.”
Paul Benedict is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt about it; Selecçao, which has been running since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 Euro.
In fact, just 90 minutes separates Portugal from happiness.
But there is a game to play and a rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Given the one-way (0-0), Friday in Zenica's hell, it seems obvious that the matter is not decided.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, yes, but could not score the valuable goal that would have given it tranquility.
“It’s a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven’t scored outside the house.”
But at home, in Lisbon’s bright Estadio de la Luz, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in front of an audience that should be equally enthusiastic, even if it is evident that the match “is very even”, said an optimistic but lucid Bento.
“We hope the match is very even, but we are completely convinced that we can take the lead,” said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
“We still have a 50% chance of participating in the 2012 Euro 2012,” said Carlos Queiroz’s successor.
Friday's tie in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
Bosnians might get a draw, but they also need to score.
“It’s a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven’t scored outside the house,” Bento laments.
"We are going to play against a team that has a great technical quality and has players with a great individual quality," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exerting, from the beginning, maximum pressure on the Bosniaks to "leave them no time to think".
It’s a good idea, as long as it’s realistic this time.
