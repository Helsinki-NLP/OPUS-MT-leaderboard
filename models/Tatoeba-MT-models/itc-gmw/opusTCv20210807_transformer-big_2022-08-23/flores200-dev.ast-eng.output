Karno is a well-known and controversial English teacher who taught Modern Education and King's Glory and claimed to have reached 9,000 students at the height of his career.
In his notes, he used words that some fathers and mothers consider rude, and according to reports, he used bad words in classes.
Modern Education accused him of putting big ads on buses without authorization and of lying that he was the main tutor of English.
He had previously been charged with copyright infringement, but had no charges.
A former student said that he "speaks fluently in classes, learns to tie notes and is like a student's friend."
In the last three decades, although officially still a communist state, China has developed a market economy.
The first economic reforms were made under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping.
Since then, China’s economic power has multiplied 90 times its value.
For the first time this year, China exported more cars than Germany and surpassed the U.S. as the largest market in the industry.
China's GDP may be higher than that of the United States in two decades.
Tropical Storm Danielle, the fourth named storm of the 2010 hurricane season, formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.
The storm, which lies approximately 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, experiences sustained winds of 40 miles per hour (64 km/h).
Scientists at the National Hurricane Center predict that Danielle will seize force and become a hurricane by Wednesday.
It remains until the storm hits land and it is difficult to calculate the potential damage in the United States or the Caribbean.
Born in the Croatian capital Zagreb, Bobek became famous by playing for the Partizán de Belgrá.
He joined them in 1945 and stayed until 1958.
In his time with the team, he scored 403 goals in 468 appearances.
Naide played as many games and scored no more goals with the team as Bobek.
In 1995, he was voted best player in the history of the Partizan.
The celebrations began with a special show by the world-renowned Cirque du Soleil group.
It was followed by performances by the Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra, an Ottoman military band, and singers Fatih Erkoç and Müslüm Gürses.

Noting the global financial situation, Zapatero added that "the financial system is part of the economy, a vital part.
We have a financial crisis that lasts a year and it had its worst moment in the last two months, and I think that now financial markets are starting to recover.
Naked News announced last week that it plans to expand international news reporting languages with three new broadcasts.
The international organization, which already reports in English and Japanese, will release versions in Spanish, Italian and Korean of its programs for television, web and mobile devices.
Luckily nothing happened to me, but I saw macabre scenes as I tried to break the windows in order to get out.
There were people beating the crystals with saddles, but the windows were unbreakable.
"One of the crystals finally broke, and they started coming out the window," said survivor Fanciszek Kowal.
Stars give light and heat for the energy they make when hydrogen atoms are mined (or fused) with other, heavier elements.
Researchers are working to create a reactor that can produce energy in the same way.
This, however, is a difficult problem to solve and it will take many years for us to see useful fusion reactors built.
The steel water floats on the water by surface tension.
The surface tension occurs because the molecules on the surface of the water are attracted more to each other than to the air molecules above them.
Water molecules form an invisible skin on the surface of the water that allows things like an eagle to float on top of it.
The modern skate blade has a double thread with a concave hole in the middle. The two threads make it better to grip the ice, until it is beaten to one side.
In the late 19th century, the ice sheets of the ice sheets were replaced by the ice sheets of the ice sheets of the ice sheets.
This causes the skater to turn, if the skates lean to the right, the skater will lean to the right, if they do so to the left, the skater turns to the left.
To return to their previous energy level, they have to get rid of the extra energy they took out of the light.
This is done by emitting a small particle of light called a photon.
Scientists call this process "stimulated emission of radiation" because atoms are stimulated with strong light, which causes the emission of a light photon, and light is a type of radiation.
The following illustration shows how atoms emit photons. Since then, photons are actually much smaller than those in the drawing.
Photons are even smaller than matter than atoms are made!
After hundreds of hours of use, the filament ends up melting and the bulb stops working.
The bulb needs to be replaced. You must search for it when you change it.
First you have to turn off the lamp or disconnect the cable.
This is because the lettering of the plug where the metal part of the bulb is connected can stick a good cramp if you touch the plug or the metal part while it is partially plugged in.
The largest organ of the circulatory system is the heart, which pumps the blood.
The blood leaves the heart for tubes called arteries and comes back for others called veins. The finer ones are called capillaries.
The teeth of a triceratops could crush not only leaves, but also strong branches and roots.
Some scientists think that the Triceratops ate cycades, which is a common type of plant in the Cretaceous.
These plants are like small palms with a glass of sharp leaf and with flakes.
The triceratops may have used their strong spike to peel the leaves before eating the butt.
Other scientists say that these plants are very poisonous, so it is unlikely that they will be eaten by any dinosaurs; at present, wildebeests and other animals such as parrots (descending from dinosaurs) can eat poisonous leaves or fruits.
How would I get the gravity out of me? If you had the surface of it, you'd weigh less than you weigh on Earth.
A person who weighs 200 pounds (90 k) on Earth will weigh about 36 pounds (16 k) in o. So gravity, of course, pulls less from you.
The Sun does not have an Earth-like court to walk in. It is made entirely of gas, fire and plasma.
The gas goes farther away from the center of the Sun.
The outer part we see looking at the Sun is called the photosphere, which literally means "the golden ball".
Some three years later, in 1610, the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe that Venus had phases, just like the Moon.
The phases occur because only the side of Venus (or the Moon) that gives the Sun receives light. The phases of Venus support Copernicus' theory that the planets rotate around the Sun.
Then, a few years later in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks observed a transit of Venus.
England lived a long period of peace after the reconquest of Danelaw.
However, in 991 Aethelred faced a Viking fleet larger than none since the time of Guthrum, a century earlier.
This fleet was led by Olaf Trygvasson, a Norwegian who had the intention of freeing his country from Danish domination.
After several military setbacks, Etelredu reached an agreement with Olaf, who returned to Norway in order to claim the throne, which he did with unequal success.
Hangul is the only alphabet on the border for its popular and everyday use. The alphabet was invented in 1444 during the reign of King Sejong (1418-1450).
Sejong the Great was the fourth king of the Joseon dynasty and is one of the most admired.
He originally called the Hangul alphabet the Hunminjeongeum alphabet, which means "sounds right for people's instruction".
There are many theories of how the Sanskrit began. One of them is about the Aryan emigration from the west to India that took their language with them.
Sanskrit is an ancient language that is comparable to Latin spoken in Europe.
The first known book in the world is written in Sanskrit. After the compilation of the Upanishads, the Sanskrit was lost in the hierarchy.
Sanskrit is a complex and rich language that served as the basis for many modern Indian languages, just as Latin is the basis for European languages such as French and Spanish.
After the French War, Germany began to prepare to invade the island of Great Britain.
Germans codenamed the attack "Operation Sea Lion". Most of the British army's weapons and supplies were lost in the evacuation of Dunkirk, so they were very weak.
However, the Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy ("Kriegsmarine") and could destroy any invasion fleet commanded by the Canal.
However, few ships of the Royal Navy were based near the probable routes of the invasion, as the admirals feared the possibility of German airstrikes melting them down.
It was the first time that the Germans had been forced to surrender their lands to the Germans.
They had a weaker army and navy, but had just made four new ships just before the war began.
The main objective of Italy was the African countries. To control these countries they needed a shuttle so that troops could cross the Mediterranean and invade Africa.
As a result, they had to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt. In addition to these actions, the Italian warships had to do nothing else.
Japan was an island country, just like Great Britain.
The Somarinos are ships designed to travel underwater, and there is a large amount of time left.
Submarines were used in World War I and World War II. Then they were very slow and had a very short range of missing.
During the war, the submarines moved over the surface of the sea, but when the radars were developed and perfected, the submarines had to be submerged in order not to be detected.
The German submarines were called U-boats. The Germans were very skilled at navigating and handling their submarines.
Due to their success with submarines, after the war the Germans were not allowed to have many.
Yes, Pharaoh Tutanchamun, sometimes called "Pharaoh Tut" or "the child Pharaoh", is one of the best-known pharaohs of Ancient Egypt in modern times.
Interestingly, it was not considered very important in ancient times and was not recorded on most lists of kings.
However, the discovery of this tomb in 1922 became famous. Although many ancient tombs were stolen, this tomb remained virtually intact.
Most of the objects buried with Tutankhamun are preserved, including thousands of artifacts made with precious metals and rare stones.
The invention of wheels with spokes made the Assyrian chariots lighter, faster and better prepared to leave behind soldiers and other chariots.
The arrows of the deadly crossbows could puncture the armor of enemy soldiers. Around 1000 BC the Assyrians introduced the first cavalry.
The knighthood is an army that fights horses. The saddle of riding had not yet been invented, so the Assyrian knighthood fought on the bare back of their horses.
Many Greek politicians, scientists and artists are well-known for their work by Homer, the legendary Greek poet who composed two masterpieces of Greek literature: the poems of the Iliad and the Odyssey.
Sophocles and Aristophanes are still popular playwrights and their works are considered among the best in universal literature.
Another famous Greek is the mathematician Pythagoras, known above all for his famous theorem on the relations between the sides of rectangular triangles.
There are calculations of how many people speak Hindi. It is thought to be between the second and fourth most spoken language in the world.
The number of native speakers changes depending on whether the correct dialects are taken into account.
Estimates range from 340 million to 500 million speakers, and up to 800 million people understand it.
Hindi and Urdu are similar in vocabulary but not in writing; speakers of both languages can be understood in everyday conversations.
By the 15th century, northern Estonia had a lot of German cultural influence.
Some German monks wanted to attack the native people, so they invented the literal Estonian language.
It was based on the German alphabet and was added to it with the spelling "/õ".
Over time, many German loans were converted. This marked the beginning of the illustration.
According to tradition, the heir to the throne would have military training only to finish his studies.
Charles attended Trinity College in Cambridge, where he studied anthropology and archaeology, and later history; he graduated in 2:2 (a minor degree).
Charles was the first member of the British royal family to earn a title.
European Turkey (Eastern Thrace or Rumelia on the Balkan peninsula) includes 3% of the country.
The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometers (1,000 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide, with a more or less rectangular shape.
Turkey's surface, including lakes, occupies 783,562 square kilometres (300948 square miles), of which 755,688 square kilometres (291,773 square miles) are in Southwest Asia and 23,764 square kilometres (9,174 square miles) in Europe.
The area of Turkey makes it the 37th largest country in the world; it has the combined size of mainland France and the United Kingdom.
Turkey is surrounded by the sea by three parts: the Aegean Sea in the west, the Black Sea in the north and the Mediterranean Sea in the south.
Luxembourg has a long history, but its independence dates back to 1839.
Part of the present Belgian territory was part of Luxembourg in the past, but it became Belgian with the Belgian Revolution of 1830.
Luxembourg has always tried to remain a neutral country, but was occupied by Germany in both World War I and World War II.
In 1957 Luxembourg became a founding member of the organisation now known as the European Union.
Drukgyal Dzong is a ruined fortress and Buddhist monastery in the upper part of the district of Paro (in the village of Phondey).
It is said that in 1649 Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel created the fort to commemorate his victory over the Tibetan-Mongolian forces.
In 1951 a fire pardoned a few Drukgyal Dzong relics, such as the sculpture of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
After the fire, the fortress was preserved and protected, remaining as one of Bhutan's most fabulous attractions.
During the 18th century, Cambodia was nestled between two powerful neighbors, Thailand and Vietnam.
The Thais invaded Cambodia several times in the 18th century and destroyed Phnom Penh in 1772.
In the late 18th century, the Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia.
Eighteen percent of Venezuelans are unemployed and most of those who work do so in the subdued economy.
Two-thirds of active Venezuelans work in their services, about one-quarter in industry and one-fifth in agriculture.
A major industry in Venezuela is oil, of which the country is a net exporter, although only one percent of the population works in the oil industry.
At the beginning of the country's independence, the experience of the Singapore Botanical Gardens helped transform the island into a tropical garden city.
In 1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim, an orchid hybrid, was chosen as the nation's national flower.
Every year, about 1.5 million herbivores travel from the northern slopes to the southern plains, crossing the Mara River in search of rain.
And, back north to the west, crossing again the Mara River, after passing the rains by April.
The Serengeti region has within the Serengeti National Park, Ngorongoro Conservation Area and Maswa Recreational Reserve and Masai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
Learning to make interactive media involves both conventional and traditional skills as well as skills learned in interactive classes (writing scripts, editing video and audio, speaking, etc.).
Interactive design requires the re-evaluation of our assumed ideas, not production and that we learn to think in non-linear ways.
Interactive design requires the components of a project to be connected to each other, but it also feels like a separate entity.
The problem with zoom lenses is that the focal complexity and number of lens elements required to reach a range of focal lengths are much greater than for fixed targets.
This has less impact because lens manufacturers are improving standards in production.
This allowed the augmentation lenses to have images of a quality comparable to that achieved by lenses with fixed focal length.
Another advantage of the magnifying glass is that the aperture or maximum speed of the lens is lower.
This makes it difficult to use cheap zoom lenses in low-light conditions without a flash.
One of the most common problems when converting a movie to DVD is over-scanning.
Most of the televisions are made to please the general public.
This is why everything you see on TV has its edges, the top, the bottom and the sides.
This is done to ensure that the image covers the entire screen. This is called overscanning.
Unfortunately, when you make a DVD, the edges are most likely also cut and, if the video has captions too close to the edge, they won't be seen at all.
The traditional medieval castle inspired much of the imagination, conjuring up images of fairness, lacuadas and Arthurian chivalry.
Until the ancient ruins are methane, it is easy to bring to mind the sound and aromas of the old battles, even to feel the noise of the helmets in the cobblestones and empty the mine up from the dungeons.
But even our imagination based on reality? Why were the castles built? How were they designed and built?
Kirby Muxloe Castle, typical of the period, is more of a fortified house than a fully fortified castle.
It was built in the late 19th century, and was built in the early 19th century.
In the 1480s, when Lord Hastings began construction, the country had relative peace and defense was no more necessary than against small gangs of thieves.
The EQUALITY OF POWER was a system in which European countries sought to maintain the national sovereignty of all states of the continent.
The idea was that all European nations sought to prevent any nation from becoming powerful and therefore national governments had often changed their alliances to maintain balance.
The War of the Spanish Succession was the first war in which the central issue was the balance of power.
This was an important exchange, because the European powers would no longer have the pretext of religious conflict. Therefore, the Thirty Years' War was the last war on religious issues.
The temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed on June 21, 356 BC in an intention of Erostratus.
According to the narrative, his motivation was fame at any cost. The Ephesians, offended, announced that the name of Erostratus should never be mentioned.
The Greek historian Strabo later wrote down the name, so we know of it today. The temple was destroyed the same night Alexander the Great was born.
Alexander, as king, offered to pay for the reconstruction, but was refused. After Alexander's death, in 323 BC, the temple was rebuilt.
Make sure that your hand is as relaxed as possible while giving notes well; also avoid the extra movements of the gods.
This way, you will tire as little as possible, remember that you do not need to hit the keys with too much force to get more volume as happens on the piano.
In accordion, to have more volume, you use the bellows with more pressure or speed.
Mysticism is the search for communion, identity, or awareness of an ultimate reality, divinity, spiritual truth, or God.
The believer seeks a direct experience, intuition, or vision of divine reality/deity or deities.
Followers are looking for certain forms of life or practices that feed those experiences.
Mysticism expresses other forms of religious belief and worship by emphasizing the direct personal experience of a single state of conscience, in particular of sealing, enlightening, and glorifying the same euphoric.
Sikhism is a religion of the Indian subcontinent. It originated in the region of Panyab in the 15th century from a sectarian divide within the Hindu tradition.
The Sikhs consider their faith to be a religion distinct from Hinduism even though they recognize Hindu roots and times.
The Sikhs call their religion Gurmat, meaning "the path of the guru". The guru is a key figure in all Indian religions, but in Sikhism he gained such importance that he is the follower of Sikh beliefs.
The religion was founded in the 15th century by the Guru Nanak (1469-1539).
However, in June 1956, Khrushchev's promises were put to the test as Poland's unrest, during which workers protested against food shortages and wage cuts, became a general protest against communism.
Khrushchev eventually sent tanks to restore the order, but he yielded to several requests and agreed to appoint the popular Wladyslaw Gomulka as the new prime minister.
The Indus Valley Civilization was a Bronze Age civilization in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent that included most of present-day Pakistan and several regions of northwestern India and northeastern Afghanistan.
Civilization flourished in the Indus River basin, hence its name.
Although some scholars call it the Indo-Sarasvati civilization, the Harapana civilization, by Harappa, the first site to be excavated in the 1920s.
The militaristic nature of the Roman Empire aided the development of medical advances.
Emperor Augustus assembled the first doctors and formed the first Roman Medical Corps to be used after the battles.
In the late 1960s, he was known for his role in the role of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and for his role in the role of the American Academy of Sciences in the field of medicine.
They have become skilled at amputating to save patients with gangrene, as well as facing turnstiles and arterial tweezers to control blood flow.
For many centuries, the Roman Empire had the great advances in medicine that have come to this day and are the basis of what we know.
Origami pureland is origami with the restriction that only one fold at a time can be made, more complex folds such as the inverse fold are not allowed, and all folds must have a clear location.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to help inexperienced practitioners or those with limited motor skills.
Children develop a sense of race and racial stereotypes as young people and this affects their behavior.
In addition, children of racial minorities with low academic performance stereotypes tend to not perform as well in classrooms after learning of the stereotype associated with their race.
MySpace is the third most popular website in the United States and has 54 million profiles today.
These web pages have attracted a lot of attention, especially in the educational field.
These websites have positive aspects, including the ease to develop a class page that can include blogs, videos, photos and other elements.
It is easy to access this page by giving a website, which makes it easy to remember and write to students who have problems with the keyboard or spelling.
It can be customized so that it is easy to read and has as many colors as we want.
Attention deficit disorder "is a neurological syndrome and the classical definition of its characteristic symptoms includes impulsivity, distraction, hyperactivity and excess energy.
It is not an intellectual disability but a learning disorder; "affects 3 out of 5 children, perhaps reaching 2 million in the United States."
Children with ADHD have trouble focusing on homework, but they can do so with things they give them, such as playing video games, watching drawings or writing sentences without punctuation.
These children are often put in many problems because they "participate in risky behaviors, get stuck and question authority" to stimulate their brain, which cannot be stimulated with normal methods.
ADD affects relationships with peers because other children cannot understand why they do what they do or why they write how they write, as well as their level of maturity is extreme.
By changing the ability to acquire knowledge and to learn, in the manner mentioned above, the basic rate at which knowledge was acquired changed.
The method of obtaining information was extreme. Pressure ceased in individual memory, but the ability to remember text became an approach.
In essence, the Renaissance significantly changed the approach to learning and the dissemination of knowledge.
Unlike other primates, hominids do not use their hands to move, carry weight, or make fun of trees.
The hands and feet of chimpanzees resemble each other in size and length, although the hand carries the weight on our knuckles as we walk.
The human hand is shorter than the foot, with straighter phalanxes.
Fossils two to three million years old reveal this change in the specialization of the hand from locomotion to manipulation.
Some people think that experiencing very lucid dreams can often be exhausting.
The main reason for this phenomenon is the result of lucid dreams, extending the length of time between the REM states.
With fewer REMs per night, you are in which real dream experiments and your body has recovered become infrequent as to be a problem.
This is as tired as getting up every twenty or thirty minutes and watching TV.
The effect depends on how often your brain tries to sleep lucidly.
The Italians in North Africa had been doing well almost from the start. The week after they declared war, on June 10, 1940, the 11th British Hussar Squadron besieged Capuzzo Fort in Libya.
In an ambush east of Bardia, the British captured the chief engineer of the tenth army, General Lastucci.
On 28 June, Marshal Italo Balbo, the governor-general of Libya and Mussolini's successor, was assassinated by a close friend while landing in Tobruc.
The game is played in many categories, from amateur college students to professional and Olympic competition.
The sport is played in duel format, one shooter against another.
Golf is a game in which players use sticks to put balls into holes.
It is played on eighteen holes in a normal track, where the players start in the first hole of the track and end up in the eighteenth.
The player who needs fewer hits, or stick hits, to complete the run wins.
It is commonly referred to as the "green" or "green" or "green".
The most common type of tourism is the type that people associate with travel: Recreational tourism.
This is when people go to a place that is very different from their daily life to relax and enjoy.
The sands, theme parks and fields are the places that leisure tourists come to say.
When the goal of our visit to a specific site is to know its history and culture, this type of tourism is known as cultural tourism.
Tourists may visit several designated places in a particular country or may choose to focus only on a specific area.
The colonials, in view of the activity, also called for reinforcements.
During the First and Third Regiments of New Hampshire with 200 men, under the command of Colonel John Stark and James Reed (both later became generals).
Stark's men were positioned along the fence at the northern end of the settler position.
When the tide opened a hole along the Mystic River in the northeastern part of the peninsula, they widened the fence with a low wall of stone in the north, ending it at the water's edge on a small beach.
Gridley and Stark punctured a post about 100 feet (30 m) ahead of the fence and ordered it not to fire until the regular soldiers had passed it.
The American plan was to launch coordinated attacks from three different positions.
General John Cadwalder launched a distraction attack against the British garrison at Bordentown, to cut off any reinforcements.
General James Ewing was to cross the river with 700 militiamen at Trenton Ferry, take the bridge over Assunpink Creek and prevent enemy troops from escaping.
The main assault force, consisting of 2,400 soldiers, was to cross the river nine miles north of Trenton, and then split into two groups, one below Greene's command and the other below Sullivan's, in order to launch an attack before it crosses.
With the change of the quarter mile to the half mile, the speed becomes much less important and the resistance is paramount.
Since then, a first-rate runner, who runs half a mile in less than two seconds, has been quick, but has to develop resistance.
In the summer months, the team was able to compete at the top of the field in order to strengthen the top of the body, making it the best preparation for the race season.
In addition, it is important to note that the health of young athletes is not guaranteed by appropriate nutritional guidelines.
Maintaining energy balance, hydrating well, and understanding the various aspects of supplementation can contribute to improved performance and increased enjoyment of the practice.
It is a relatively inexpensive sport; however, there is a lot of confusion in that there is little equipment needed to do so.
Products can be purchased as needed, but most will have little or no impact on performance.
Athletes may prefer a product even if it gives them real benefits.
The atom can be considered one of the fundamental foundations of any matter.
It is a perplexed entity, consisting, according to Bohr's simplified model, of an electron-orbited nucleus, in some ways similar to the planets orbiting the sun - see Figure 1.1.
The nucleus is made up of two particles – neutrons and protons.
Protons have a positive charge and neutrons have no charge. Electrons have a negative charge.
To see the victim, you must first check the scene to ensure your safety.
You have to look at the victim's position when you lie down and see any automatic warning signs.
If you miss trying to help, maybe the only thing you do is make it worse too.
The study showed that depression, disability, and catastrophic thinking mediate the relationship between pain and disability in people with low back pain.
Only the effects of catastrophic thinking, not depression, and the severity were conducive to the weekly sessions of PA.
Those who participate in regular activities need more support in terms of negative perception of pain, distinguishing the differences between chronic pain and the feeling of discomfort of normal physical movement.
Vision, or the ability to see, depends on the visual system's sensors or eyes.
There are many different eye constructions, which vary in complexity depending on the needs of the body.
Different constructs have different capacities, are sensitive to different wave frequencies, and have different degrees of acuity. In addition, they require different processing to understand input and different numbers to function optimally.
A population is the set of organisms of a particular species in a given geographical area.
When all individuals in a population are identical in relation to a particular phenotype, they are known as monomorphic.
When subjects show several variants of a phenotype, they are polymorphic.
It was the first time that the ants had been killed in the battle.
In the nomadic phase the ants' armies make night marches and stop to camp by day.
The colony begins a nomadic phase when the available food is reduced. At this stage, the colony makes temporary nests that change every day.
These nomadic syrups or marches last about 17 days.
What is a cell? The word cell comes from the Latin word "cell" which means "small room" and was first used by a researcher who observed the structure of the cork.
The cell is the basic unit of all living things, and all organisms are composed of one or more cells.
In fact, cells are so basic and important to the study of life that they are often called the "gates of life".
The nervous system maintains homeostasis by sending nerve impulses throughout the body to maintain blood flow well and without problems.
These nerve impulses can be sent so quickly across the body that they help keep the body safe from any potential threat.
The thunderbolts affect a smaller area compared to other strong storms, but they also destroy their pass.
Trees are torn apart, buildings are torn apart, and cars are thrown into the air. Two percent of the most violent tornadoes last for more than three hours.
These monstrous storms have winds of up to 380 km/h (133 m/s, 300 mph)
Humans have been making and using lenses for thousands and thousands of years to increase their size.
However, the first true telescopes were made in Europe at the end of the 16th century.
These telescopes use a combination of two lenses to make distant objects appear closer and larger at the same time.
Envy and selfishness are a part of ourselves and co-operation when there are benefits for most. You’ll always earn more on time if you’re arrogant.
Fortunately, most people realize that the best long-term option is to work together with others.
Many people dream of the day when humans will be able to tell another star and explore other worlds. Some find out what's out there, have them believe there are aliens or other lives on other planets.
But if this happens again, it probably doesn't happen long. The stars are so divided that there are trillions of miles between stars that they are "neighbors".
One day, your grandchildren arrive on a planet with alien life and ask for their origins.
Animals are made of many cells. They eat things and tell them inside. Most animals can move.
Only animals have brains (although they do not have all animals; watermelons, for example, do not have).
