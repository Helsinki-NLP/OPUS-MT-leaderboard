A Republican strategy to counter Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth, claiming that election fraud is rarer in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
In fact, Republican lawyers have only recorded 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of U.S. governments enacted new laws starting in 2009 that made the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon gained momentum after the November 2010 elections, which saw the addition of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced in 2011 alone.
New electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce advance voting periods, invalidate the right to register as a voter on polling day and remove citizens with a judicial record from their right to vote.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to make such a claim.
In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Indiana law.
The Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present an identity card with a photo.
It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity card such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo IDs issued by a government agency in their state.
Moreover, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity document.
However, it often costs more than a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income people.
Indeed, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required photo ID.
Much more.
Students, voters considered to be voting more for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their photo ID issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use the cards issued by these clubs to vote.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to make such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic voting.
However, it appears that two out of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party.
In 2011, Republican lawmakers sponsored laws abolishing voter registration on polling day in eight states.
In addition, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns helped register about 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the registration rate of new voters by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have enacted laws in five other states aimed at reducing the advance voting period.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African-American, while the latter accounted for only 13% of the state’s voters.
The same was true with the Hispanics.
These represented only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, whites who made up 76% of the electorate represented only 46% of the voters voting in advance.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by vetoes from Democratic governors.
The attorney general of the United States intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
Nevertheless, the new rules will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisanness of the laws that have been voted on and see it as an obvious goal to influence results in 2012 in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that the states that passed these laws accounted for 171 of the 270 votes needed by the Electoral College to win the presidency.
It is too early to say for sure that these legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate Cancer Screening: Passing the Test or Not?
In fact, the PSA test would sometimes present incorrect results, with false negative results or false positives, which result in unnecessary medical interventions.
This makes men who are already reluctant to pass screening tests even more hesitant.
Passing the test or not?
We asked for the advice of two specialists.
In studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and have firm recommendations.
Another study, the European one, concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who had a screening and those who did not.
This study also showed, with follow-up after 12 years, that we have between 30 and 40% more chance of having metastases if we are not detected.
So I recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if you have a direct relative who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once cancer has been detected.
There are some aggressive cancers and others that are indolent.
We really need to make the patient understand the degree of risk of his or her cancer, offering him or her options, not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect long-term life, and instead opting, in these cases, for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who are diagnosed with cancer will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
They will be suggested to do active monitoring and if the disease progresses, they will be offered treatment.
Increasingly, precise criteria are being determined for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I still recommend taking the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine if you should pass it or not.
Together with the International Society of Urology, Movember has created a tool to assess the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Prevent the disease
Unfortunately, there are no miracle recipes to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, adopting good lifestyle habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from them.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
“If no one smoked anymore, this rate would rise to at least 50%,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Many are also completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, tobacco control remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Cigarette smoking is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for many others.
It hurts people’s health a lot.
"Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer drops by half.
The weight
Overweight and obesity also promote the onset of the disease, according to CSC.
They would increase the risk of breast, colon and rectal, esophageal, pancreatic and uterine cancers.
"Research shows that regular, lifelong physical activity protects against colon cancer," he added.
The food
The organization also recommends limiting your consumption of red meat.
In too large a quantity, it raises the risk of having colorectal cancer.
Steaks too, and they should be avoided.
Preserving meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," it said.
The Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not conclusive at the moment.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the CSC.
While one noted a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is also not clear.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu stresses the importance of discussing his concerns and family history with his doctor.
"Passing a screening test doesn't give cancer."
The Higgs Boson
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson created quite a stir last summer, and for good reason.
It is believed that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Universe, just that.
And then, this is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model – our best, or “less worst” explanation of the nature and behavior of matter – but which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists, it’s still not entirely certain if it’s the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we hold an authentic new particle, and that it closely resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto seem to confirm this, but there is still a lack of data to be perfectly sure.
Suppose it's the Higgs, since the chances of making mistakes seem slim, and let's see what it's about.
There is, in this little world, a fatally unavoidable law that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you're going to hurt yourself.
But even if particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has such a law: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" consisting roughly of some of their characteristics.
From there, physicists classify particles into two categories.
In a corner there are good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey Pauli’s principle.
And in the other one there are the Bosons, a filthy band of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least not for that principle, which means that they can actually be in the same place, at the same time.
These bosons then split into two groups, according to Berkeley Laboratories' (absolutely extraordinary, by the way) The Particle Adventure: the mesons, which we will not discuss here, and the "particles of force", through which the great forces of nature spread and to which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
These bosons, it must be emphasized here, are not all as exotic as one might think.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to a boson of an extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "particle of light" that is the "messenger" of electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an electrical charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disturbs" the electromagnetic field at that precise location, much like a pebble thrown into a pond.
From this "inconvenience" arises an electromagnetic wave (of light, or of infrared, or of ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon - and therefore, one of the "force-bearing" bosons.
More stable field
The same goes for the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, that must be "disturbed" for this boson to appear.
Now, this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it must reach very, very high energies, a bit as if it were a frozen pond of which only a very large rock could wrinkle the surface.
That's why it takes a huge particle accelerator like that of CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a 27 km ring in circumference! - to reach such energies.
Analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and mass.
Not all particles or materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, do, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold on to a refrigerator by itself.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the others (like the photon, tens) do not.
Now, what "can" all this research bring, asks Mrs. Plamondon?
For science, this is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to scrutinize any discrepancy between the observations and predictions of the MS.
Moreover, there are many who are eager to be found, because the slightest difference could open a door on a "new physics" and block some holes in the Model.
This one, it must be said, still has huge deficiencies, offering no explanation for gravity (ops!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the Universe (re-ops!).
But no such discrepancies have been found at CERN so far.
Consequences
The repercussions of this research in the daily lives of Mr. and Mrs. All-World are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be none.
At the very beginning of the 1960s, the pioneers of the laser at Bell Laboratories did not suspect the revolution that their work was going to trigger.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed), in 1962 - initially was rather seen as a "lab gadget".
Imagine...
And then, the applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the search.
For example, this same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his work in optics.
This sensor, although not its original intention at all, now serves as an “eye” for all digital cameras in the world, and earned it the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This of course does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it does mean that, really, we never know...
Palliative care - The best way to die...
With its Commission dying in dignity, Quebec recently debated the delicate end-of-life issue.
The debate must resume shortly as a bill is being prepared.
In this vital area, however, much remains to be done.
The Duty tried to take a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. still lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that gnawed him had left him a two-year respite.
"They had given me five years to live, I turned seven," he said, half a fig-drawn, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
“But it’s always a shock, you can’t be prepared for that,” he says.
The disease does its job: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the toilet alone, and even eating alone.
Attached to an appetizing lunch, he agrees to be helped to eat, resigned.
Courageous, he even manages to smile, talks to strangers who work around him, bring him his medicines, offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
“My biggest wish is to be cured of diarrhea, it’s humiliating,” he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this disease.
"During our lives, we learn that a man pisses upright," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois house.
Going back to the child stage, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
“It depends on the person’s ability to accept regression,” he says.
Because, in the opinion of several people working in palliative care, great moments take place at the very heart of this regression.
Patients entering the Victor-Gadbois hospice are all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this point, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provide so-called "curative" care.
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die “consciously and suffocated.”
But the disease made me discover my children.
“I have good kids,” she adds.
“I no longer have wishes in life,” she said, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
In the next few days, however, she expects a final visit from her son from Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, a group of volunteers provide body care and food assistance.
It is palliative care, which is given when there is nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative care bed for 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little when you know that we all end up dying one day.
Here, life goes on in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the house.
Whether it is physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
In the dying, we will agree to provide oral care to brandy or Pepsi, depending on the request.
Diabetics will no longer have to control their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night, we served a beer to Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning, his son will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help loved ones as much as we help patients,” says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
At the Victor-Gadbois house, the days follow each other but do not resemble each other.
Alongside an old 93-year-old man savoring his last family gathering in the courtyard, neatly tucked into his pillows while being toasted in his honor, a 36-year-old man dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children, after trying everything to survive.
“For the past six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45,” Dr. Christiane Martel said.
53% of patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadbois house arrive from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient has reached the terminal stage of his or her life, whether at home, in the hospital or in the nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois House and the Greater Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in the care offered to cancer patients.
It is precisely this great deficiency in Quebec's health care that has caused many palliative care physicians to fear the passage of a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by palliative care leaders Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to testify to their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system is not performing well enough to ensure that everyone is entitled to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
Recently, she said, I have seen a patient spend 14 days in the emergency room, in great pain, without doing anything necessary to relieve her.
I fear that patients will only ask to die because they do not receive the right care.
And at the same time, many oncologists struggle with their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Helene Richard's survival expectations were already minimal when she abandoned arduous chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she said she regretted that I stopped fighting.
But she told me I was done!
Not almighty care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask to die thank caregivers for not complying with their request after they were relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Greater Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, patients would be reluctant to treatment for pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which is the practice of falling asleep until the patient dies, either sporadically or permanently.
We can no longer pretend not to hear that part of suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
Sick people who are not relieved always say the same phrase: “I want to die.”
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want you to euthanize me,” it means “I want to be relieved.”
The report was made possible through a journalism fellowship from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, BTP contractors, political party fundraisers and Italian mafia specialists tell day after day what they know about a formidable “system,” mixing the building industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafia.
An "industry" that has cost Quebec taxpayers dearly, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's curious how the system has been crumbling since we took over the big money," said Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former Montreal police chief.
It was through him that the scandal broke in 2011, through a fundamental investigation into the malfeasances related to road construction contracts in Quebec, to which the Liberal Prime Minister of the time, Jean Charest, had only consented to backtrack.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, occult party financing and corruption of civil servants.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010, the Ministry of Transport alone has saved a billion dollars on contracts,” he said.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors", he adds, hoping that it will manage to "demonstrate the ploys behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, is also working with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
Plus the policemen of the "Marteau Squad" who, since 2009, would have led the "sewer cartel" of Montreal to put the soft pedal on the swelling of contracts...
In recent weeks, she has carried out serial searches and brought charges of fraud and corruption against municipal officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban town.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his position as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third city.
He is suspected of repeatedly pocketing bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Also formally accused are Montreal street engineers and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter made a sensation by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
For years he paid 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia-linked intermediary who was donating the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito sowed wildly in the 2000s, giving more than $88,000 (about $68,000) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals then in power.
He also admitted to having organized an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewerage contracts that inflated costs
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption was working roundly.
Gilles Surprisant, a former public works engineer, detailed it well before the commission: in ten years, he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes totaling $736,000, in exchange for sewer contracts whose costs he inflated.
Other road officials have confessed to having their paws grease by inflating the bills by 30% to 40%, with fake extras.
Then an organizer of the mayor’s party, Martin Dumont, accused Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to a parallel budget feeding his coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal’s first elected officials to sound the alarm.
Mayor of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she rebelled in 2010 against the sale of a municipal land bought 5 million dollars and resold... 1.6 million to developers, in the midst of a real estate boom.
70% of money in election campaigns
From the investigation that will finally be set up, she says that she "pulls on a thread to understand the operation of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and pin the culprits."
The process, she says, is “painful but positive.”
We're cleaning up the wound, but it would take a Montreal-specific investigation unit and a wake-up call, not to see the dubious practices come back.
Just like we do the cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is especially concerned about the role of "chosen to know the ploy", when they did not stumble into the scam!
Estimated at 70% of the dirty money in the funding of election campaigns in Quebec, he ironizes: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes limiting donations to parties to $100, but that won’t change, he says: “As long as we don’t strictly limit election spending, there will be dirty money in politics.”
He advocates a complete overhaul of the system of awarding public contracts and financing parties: "We can't go any lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house on a stronger basis, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in their own backyard...
PSG is not FC Barcelona!
This season, you’ve taken on a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
It can be explained by an individual awareness but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Every day, I make progress by their side.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
On a daily basis, these elements push me to raise my level of play.
And in a match, it's easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I'm not inflamed.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine pre-training centre to my time in Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed in stages.
So you take advantage of the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer’s recruits are used to playing very high-level games.
They also know that every workout is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my positioning.
He is supported by assistants like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Sure.
Ancelotti inspires respect in all technicians.
Today, he is unmatched in Ligue 1 and is one of the best European coaches.
He has great experience and has won many titles with hip clubs.
He was with some great players.
I think he will win other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a heartwarming discussion with him.
I was getting out of a series of injuries.
The trust he gives me also explains my performance.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took the place of leader.
But we remain in ambush.
One of our major goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the 8th final with the way.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as we can.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we will have our say in front of very good European teams.
We want to finish first of our group, ahead of Porto, in order to receive in the 8th final return.
Can PSG become a major European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris needs to win titles and register in the long run.
Today, that is not the case.
Financially, PSG is giving itself the means to make this project a reality.
In Ligue 1, not winning the title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really want to win this championship.
Last season, we didn’t go far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We had a great season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, you're supposed to be a champion...
But another team, Montpellier, has achieved an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it’s the right one.
Even if big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to win.
Do you think the media expects too much from PSG?
It is normal to expect a lot from us given what has been invested and the players we have.
We totally accept it.
Afterwards, when we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and we still find things to blame, it’s sure to be a bit frustrating.
I wonder what people expect more.
You can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We're trying to set up a game project.
A team is built over time.
We proved in the league that there were champions present.
Look at Manchester City who have not been able to qualify for the 8th final for two seasons, they have also made huge expenses!
With regard to the money invested, we imagined you with 15 points ahead of the truce!
It was neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in the month of May we can have a smile telling us that, despite all the difficulties, we ended up winning.
PSG seems totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Good thing we're saying there's a "Zlatan addiction."
That means Ibrahimovic is very good and has a lot of goals.
He came for that and he proves that he is the star of League 1.
He proved everywhere he went that he was a great player, a world star.
Within the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men he has around him.
What he did is truly exceptional.
This encourages others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like a disappointment.
I wanted to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from grabbing play time.
I saw things there and came out strengthened.
Today, I can make good matches in the selection.
That's what I've been hoping for since my baptism with the Blues.
The lessons have been learned from what has happened in Ukraine, and today we must be exemplary in our behaviour.
What do you look at the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Blues?
He has the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the win.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
White had achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will drive the Blues to Brazil.
The good draw (1-1) ripped out, on October 16th, in Spain, is it a founding match?
This match gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
“Before this shock in Spain, I had never experienced such a match in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
The opposite of current central bank-based exchanges, identified transactions and processing fees between stakeholders.
Moreover, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, made of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files from peer to peer.
Approximately 200,000 transactions have already been recorded thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
A few thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a means of payment.
The price of bitcoin, after peaking at $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, dropped to $2 five months later, before returning today to around ten dollars (the prices are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing very impressive, compared to world trade in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) has been interested in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
She describes bitcoin as “the most successful virtual currency,” “competing with the dollar or euro,” and “similar to conventional currencies.”
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currency such as “credits”, used to progress in a video game that you win by playing or that you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed this type of system.
But each time, a central authority controls and processes the exchanges.
With Bitcoin, all nodes in the network are both account book holders, auditors, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users is actually made between two email addresses in the manner of an email.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins do exist in the public ledger, spread throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It goes through solving a mathematical challenge thrown at computers, and whose winner, sort of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding this extra line.
This is a file hashing phase, that is to say, the transformation of a large file into a shorter and more unique digital footprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before "hacking" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that gives a particular footprint (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily check that it is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the footprint.
If, for fraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphaned because the two have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to the one hundred millionth, which leaves room...
The difficulty of the challenge is also addressed with each increase in computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in stolen deposits.
“The flaw used is not the protocol itself,” says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also mentions the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this flaw.
Prominent actors like Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blogging platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the ledger and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, “giant balances” were launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of an educational book on this currency, strongly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus return cheaper.
The wearer also manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement with merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
They just need to provide an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize," says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement of questioning hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
“It will take time for Bitcoin to take hold, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, plans to reassess the various risks, now considered high, if the currency succeeds.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their zone of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
It is mainly Afghan peasants that we have punished as terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the mutilated.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former chiefs refugees in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse the presence of foreign armies, as in the days of the Soviets.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes aided by local insurgents, they will no longer be when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credits, was done in order.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles reached Kabul without being attacked, overflew by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban raids on Kabul by the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country in fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
Their takeover of the country was then perceived as a sort of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the obscurantism of these peasants overtaken by the al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved these days.
Former Mujahideen, Afghan government and current Taliban join in the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main notables of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They turned into businessmen, seizing government land and reselling it on construction land to refugees returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge U.S. outsourcing contracts.
They disrespected themselves; most of them did not fight themselves.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have known how to take advantage of American largesse: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They met the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated the advantages.
Approximately 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In the cities, government schools are full, both girls and boys.
It will be necessary to provide work for those young people who will no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including armed opponents, are fond of mobile phones; television, and its Turkish soap operas that feature a modern world, are followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who order it be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned with rebuilding provincial militias, which will escape central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization, like Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state with strong presidential power, abolishing the post of prime minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially in the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
No industries have been restarted, no dams are in good condition, no major irrigation systems are repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country ruined by thirty years of war, government control over infrastructure would have been necessary.
Rumor has been spread that Afghanistan possessed immense mineral wealth.
This only added to the feeling that the Westerners were only there to seize it.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper on site, or means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine, letting international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) search the huge Buddhist site and remain the most important employers in the province.
One day, too, Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports are largely dependent, will need to restore normal relations.
The departure of the French fighting troops ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' and boys' high school, French department at the university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, in an attempt to "win hearts and minds" and to carry out the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, carried out, and carried out by a small French NGO, many works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of villages.
These works, greedy in local labor, have been able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase in arable areas.
What will we leave as a souvenir, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much smaller budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very harsh in these valleys, which are often more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in Kapisa Province.
If they are to break free from the insurrection of foreign groups, which the farmers have told me they want, we should maintain a small, well-controlled civilian aid that directly affects them.
A Constitution at the Forceps in Egypt
This is another poker shot by President Mohammed Morsi.
As Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which grants it provisional full powers, it has decided to play its va-tout.
Taking everyone off the hook, he announced Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State granted this House an additional two months to finish its work.
For almost two years now, Egypt has relied on a provisional text, which has repeatedly amended what weakens institutional stability and leads to legal cheating.
This new initiative has only increased the gap in the country.
For his opponents, the President persists in his "autocratic delirium", continuing to "betray his word" and "treat the law".
On the part of its supporters, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible, accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within two weeks.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to renounce their project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy as protest rages across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Especially since this use of a hasty vote is the ultimatum of the Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text or I keep the full powers", these are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It was in a strange mood that 85 members of this constituent assembly, with a large Islamist majority, voted on the text yesterday.
Most of the Liberals missed the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had shut the door, believing they could not have asserted their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society had done the same.
In order for the necessary quorum to be reached, 11 replacement members were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, it is most often unanimously that the articles were voted on.
Commentators have amused themselves that one of the day's only differences has been expressed around... the time of prayer, with some members of the committee believing that the Constituent Assembly's pendulum was ill-adjusted.
The text, which was still being voted on last night, contains 234 articles.
Subject of all attention, Article 2 ultimately remains the same as the 1971 Constitution, stipulating that "the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to be able to replace "principles" with "rules", which would have allowed stricter enforcement.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," say the Liberals, who see it as a communication blow.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
These include Article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, particularly in verifying the compliance of laws with Sharia law.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "the people called to pronounce are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see the beginnings of a theocracy.”
The fears of the Liberals are further aroused by the fact that the next rector of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
“For now, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil status.
Most of the jurists who have worked on this text are not ulemas but academics, for some trained in the French system," tempers Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges "that there may be ambiguity around Article 220, because the terms used borrow from religious vocabulary.
It is referred to as "fiqh" in particular [Islamic jurisprudence, ed].
And the question may arise in the future to what extent civil judges are competent to rule on it.”
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is highly criticized because of the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another point of contention: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the defence budget review will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
Nor will trials of civilians in military courts be prohibited, as demanded by human rights associations.
They also express their concerns about the text, which they consider liberticoid.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and the insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression, including the press.
In addition, no more articles echo the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture under article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the center of the world and a sea of brine await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the grandeur of Bible truths, modern comfort, and wild nature.
Argoumenty i Fakty has retained five great reasons to go to Israel.
Go and worship the holy places.
A must-see: the banks of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone who enters these "baptismal funds" will be touched by divine grace.
As for Galilee, it is the land of Jesus' miracles: where the water was turned into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he calmed the storm, or where the fishing was miraculous.
It was at this precise place that Jesus appeared before his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it is in Jerusalem.
Believers walk along the Rue de la Suffering or the Way of the Cross (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the Antonia fortress (the praetorium), where the trial was held, then leads through the streets of the old town to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to that of the Anointing Stone and the tomb.
This is where the Christian centre of the world stands, the symbol of humanity’s salvation.
According to Christian legend, the monastery of the Cross is erected at the place where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified grew.
Jerusalem is also home to the holiest place of the Jews: the Western Wall, which is the remnant of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 BC.
According to tradition, people of different denominations leave there small words accompanied by prayers that are then answered.
Travel in height
Visit the ruins of Masada Fortress, an ancient refuge against enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 BC for his family.
These ruins are found on the steep rocks of a mountain 450 m above sea level.
Only mountaineering enthusiasts can get there by their own means.
For others, a cable car takes them to this summit full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m above sea level, is the ski resort of Mont Hermont which welcomes many tourists in the winter.
A shuttle can take you there from the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes are a total of 45 km long.
Old beliefs want pagan gods to have once inhabited the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
This country is home to nearly 300 museums.
It is not possible to visit all of them during a single stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that are really worth a visit.
First of all: the Israel Museum located near the Knesset (parliament).
It houses the very ancient Qumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls, discovered in the caves of the Judean Desert, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
See also: Tel Aviv Museum of Art.
Mainly exhibited are the paintings of the impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre, the Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths composed of molds of the visitors and overseers of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the only private Ralli Museum where you can admire sculptures of Rodin.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Entrance is free and donations are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum, located in Tel Aviv, which returns to the most dramatic historical pages in history.
The most tragic part is the children's memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children exterminated in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and enter into total darkness.
Stars are shining.
You then hear the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health and well-being
Israel’s three major seaside resorts are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and giant aquariums.
Note: you can swim in the Red Sea even in winter, as the water temperature does not drop below 21° while that of the air can reach 23°.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and you can swim there all year round.
By the way, it is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point on Earth, 417 m below sea level.
The azure water contains brine and very easily retains bathers, even those who do not know how to swim.
The landscapes that surround it are of surreal beauty.
We come here to perform a treatment based on salt water, silt, curative sludge and to treat various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes but also to simply relax.
Discover the secrets of antiquity
They are guarded by Tel Aviv’s old town, Jaffa, on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris that connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life.
Tourists especially like to walk in the narrow alleys that bear the name of the zodiac signs.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to "your" sign, fate will smile at you.
In Jaffa you will be able to meet newlyweds who have come to take photo shoots from all over Israel and even from other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk in the Roman theater, "conquer" the fortress of the Crusaders.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Note to tourists
If you are going to Israel, do not worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer the dollars to the euro, as they are easily exchanged in shekels (now 1 dollar is equivalent to 3.8 shekels).
As for urban transport, it is mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haifa has the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and able to connect the lower and upper parts of the city.
It is almost an underground funicular.
The journey in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, Jewish tradition wants to celebrate the Sabbath on Saturdays.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transport cease to operate.
And the work week starts on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels serve only kosher food, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes composed of both milk and meat.
It offers a multitude of dishes based on lamb and beef, soups and desserts based on coconut milk but also hummus, traditional Jewish pasta, different sauces, balls of ground chickpeas, falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well-fed cats that walk the haughty air.
You can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
These cats love passing places and do not refuse to be given a treat.
Car rental varies from $37 for 24 hours (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 a day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
On average, admission to the museum costs 30 shekels.
The Language of Numbers
Three million tourists from around the world visited Israel in 2012.
They were mostly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, before visas were cancelled on 9 February 2011.
"Who has the language, Moscow goes": migrants save money to learn the language
While MPs and human rights activists are arguing about what the mandatory language test law will give, fraudsters selling “false” certificates have already appeared in the country
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal: to make money to help their families stay at home.
Since December 1, a law has come into force and stipulates that every migrant worker will have to pass a Russian exam.
For the time being, this rule only applies to those who intend to work in the services, housing, personal services and retail sectors.
However, over time, the Federal Migration Service promises, the tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, knowledge of the language will have to be validated, as well as knowledge of the history of Russia and of the legal foundations.
You will need to validate your Russian language skills to obtain and renew your work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russian has official language status are exempt.
Persons who obtained certificates or educational diplomas before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also not affected by this law.
Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of examination centres will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, People's Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to take exams in every city in the country: more than 160 centers have already been opened throughout the country.
This initiative to introduce examinations was supported by the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law comes into force, human rights defenders have already repeatedly asked the question in the press: what will it give?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First of all, respond the representatives of the immigration service, this will reduce the number of people suffering "from slavery at work".
Many talk about defending the rights of migrant workers, says the director of the office of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
Protection of rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized selection system will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise for migrants without a job, without training, those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without an understanding of the language, Sebelev certifies, the future migrant is destined to meet dishonest people who, on the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a “journey” in an overcrowded house where he and dozens of his fellows will torment each other for months without food and paper and will have to commute between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
“At home they are promised one thing, and when they arrive, they are cheated, their passports are taken, and they do not receive the stipulated salary,” said Tolib Charipov, head of the Migration Services Directorate for the work of the Tajikistan Migration Service.
Don't argue with me, Officer!
However, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to make money in Russia say that they not only do not know the language of the country they want to go to, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
It is not their fault, of course, but their misfortune: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to follow even a passable primary education.
Indeed, their families do not even have enough to feed their children without talking about dressing them properly and equipping them for school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people leave to make money as soon as the opportunity arises.
It’s hard when you don’t know the language, they say.
“You feel diminished and diminished.”
However, human rights defenders note an important aspect of the language law.
The exams will only be aimed at migrants who have legal status.
Without status, there will be no examination or official work thereafter.
Yet most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or Defend to Enter"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason? Administrative barriers and always these language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 rubles.
And then, one can get a fake registration quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we do not have a record, hence the cases of extortion.
"They ask us for 100, 200 rubles, what to buy cigarettes, tea," Umed Khouchkadamov, a Tajik national, told reporters.
“Be quick, don’t let go and buy yourself a beautiful work of art.”
From the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was discovered that the registration documents of migrants were not the only ones to be false.
Several false language exam certificates have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service.
Forged papers come out of an ordinary color printer.
Of course, their new owners didn’t take them for nothing: every migrant who thus hoped to facilitate the task of examinations had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: this will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Power representatives and human rights defenders agree that the short-term goal is to protect the system from corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these “paper bottles”.
The authorities can give migrant workers who have not been able to validate the exam the first time to take language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve actively communicating with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to tighten the law against the bearers of civilian weapons.
This is the response of the authorities to recent incidents: whether the shootings carried out at weddings or the killings organized by the Moscow jurist Dmitry Vinogradov, who killed seven people.
The police want to ban the wearing of rubber bullets in public places and raise the legal age for obtaining the gun permit by increasing it from 18 to 21.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma’s committee on security and anti-corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that amendments to the gun law would be introduced at the State Duma soon.
Not everyone is happy to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "closing the screw".
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centers, demand to abandon "this senseless hardening".
The percentage of crimes committed with a recorded weapon is minimal, said Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and crime specialist for the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, over a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police services while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded over the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that tightening civil weapons laws will not prevent criminals from sourcing into the black market.
According to them, you can find any weapon in Moscow today for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior says it controls the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factory to officer
The black market for weapons is provided through several channels.
The main canals are five, says Victor Baranets, a retired colonel who served ten years in the Ministry of Education and Headquarters.
Screenshot taken from a site taking weapons commands
The first is "military trace", that is, the weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by the Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians," Baranets said.
The second type of weapons coming from the black market are those stolen by criminals from law enforcement.
Baranets explains that these are both weapons stolen from police stockpiles and weapons stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal pistols go on sale from military warehouses.
Many of these have often been subjected to explosions.
"Certified versions indicate that some fires were purposely set off to hide the deficit," the former military official said.
For Baranets, the arms manufacturers are there for something.
“We see private weapons factories that do not compete with the competition in the international market and are selling weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow,” says one expert.
One of the other black market sources is smuggling.
A significant proportion of guns and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
“There is a local production, sometimes handicrafts, a mafia has formed and organizes the supply,” adds the former soldier.
Where do the weapons come from?
Experts have assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on this issue was formed in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Study for Public Administration.
Specialists analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data from weapons portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers explain, come from the military and law enforcement.
Half of the weapons on the black market were found there “due to the fault of employees whose work is related to weapons,” the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from places of military conflict, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% are from "clandestine looting".
A salesman and consultant at an armory who has asked to remain anonymous assures that for a long time no one has bought the weapons found by these clandestine search specialists; they are too old.
Most often, according to him, sellers will fetch the new goods from military warehouses.
The person buys through a sign a unit, for example a TT gun.
We deliver it to him by passing the goods through a wire mesh.
“He transports it to the city and sells it for €900 per unit with two chargers,” he says.
"It is true that the police are aware of all the cases, so when crimes are about to be clarified, they make a purchase of control from illegal arms dealers," he added.
"Like in a luxury shop"
The seller and the buyer are usually found through knowledge.
I consulted sites, blogs, until a guy showed up and offered me to come to the Begovaya station where someone came to take me to a "corner" to bargain.
The price of the gun was given to me on the spot.
Victor Baranets as a military observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explains the seller. I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are sellers in the markets, but there you have to come also saying, for example, "On the part of such a person, who asked me to convey that his daughter has lost a tooth."
Now I even buy a pair of American fists with the help of a person I trust.
He gives them only to me because he knows I won't give them.
The new kids are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Victor Baranets tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s as he prepared to publish an article on the subject.
The patterns, he said, have not changed.
He was given a photo album with “everything you want.”
“I thought I was in a luxury shop,” the soldier recalls.
There is no secret for the buyer, Baranets explains, we can try everything.
As a potential customer, I don’t just buy, we go with the seller to the forest and set up a target.
“They let me shoot and when I’m convinced the gun is working well, we start negotiating,” the expert describes.
A shop from its sofa
Search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons "for different purposes".
For this, we do not need any documents and no one to meet.
“You just have to have a precise amount of money,” the ad reads on the website “Buy a gun or a fight machine gun.”
Users leave their request and ask their questions.
Do we sell to minors?
"Without permission, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (spelling preserved).
"Buy TT. Moscow", writes "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has broadcast a huge network of fake sites and shovels people willing to buy combat weapons.
People rush on food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves mining coal in Siberia
Victor Baranets, observer and former soldier
I have heard about these types of schemes: generally, the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take the controls.
The buyer makes the payment on the automatic terminals.
"He receives in return a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden," said Dmitry Kislov, secretary of the "Right to a Gun" association.
Victor Baranets states that by making a request on the site, one can end up without a gun and behind bars.
The Federal Security Service has broadcast a huge network of fake sites and shovels people willing to buy combat weapons.
“People run over food like hungry wolves and then they end up mining coal in Siberia,” he said.
One Makarov for $100
Buying an illegal firearm, experts estimate, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the association "Right to a gun", one can buy a Makarov pistol for 100-300 dollars.
It will take about a month and a half.
It came out of long-term warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to official data from the ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the number of these crimes overall decreased in Russia by 7% and amounted to 22.9 miles while the reported cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and bombs fell by 7.8%.
U.S.: Fast Food and Supermarket Employees on Strike
Nearly a quarter of American teenagers go through a cashier’s job at McDonald’s
In recent days, a wave of protests has mounted against the low salaries of Walmart supermarkets and famous fast food chains such as McDonald’s, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy’s and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
At the moment, no one can predict whether this wave will grow larger or fade quickly.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing associations.
Along with the modest wage increases for basic workers at Walmart and in fast food chains, the organizers of the demonstrations want to get the creation of unions.
This sector is not yet covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week, after Thanksgiving, as a flood of millions of people seized America and sometimes sparked outbursts.
On that day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs to organize strike pickets with unions and left-wing activists in the company’s stores whose products are intended for the modest and middle-class consumers.
Walmart markets everything from diapers to hunting rifles to car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many low-paid Walmart employees shop only at their place of work.
The price and choice of products have made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its products cheaply due to the low salaries of its employees.
They also complain about difficult working conditions, for example the lack of forklifts or portable scanners.
The participants of the "Black Friday" protests demanded a salary increase, they complained that the price of the medical insurance provided by the company had increased from $ 30 to 100 per month.
For the Walmart basic employee who earns $9.5 an hour, that's an amount he can't afford.
Scientists at the California University of Berkley show that if Walmart increased the average salary to $12 an hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
That’s 1.1% more than he currently spends.
If Walmart were to transfer the entire wage increase onto the shoulders of consumers, every run in the store would cost them an extra 46 cents.
They will spend only $12.39 more in a year than they do now.
Walmart supporters note with satisfaction that the protests took place in only nine states and did no harm to the group.
The "Black Friday" continued in stores from 8am to midnight the next day and Walmart sold over this period 5000 items per second.
Its coffers have made a total of 100 million transactions for "Black Friday".
The company’s spokesman Dan Fogleman told the left-wing Huffington Post that at least “less than five” Walmart employees had left their jobs and that the protest was just a “com operation among so many” on the part of the organizing union.
"Next customer!"
The protests continued this week in New York and also concerned Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not very appreciated, which is why they are not yet established) but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald’s advertises selling billions of servings and after they don’t even give you sick leave and pay you the work you did honestly!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council Member
Currently, the federal and New York minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast foods increase them over time, but by a little, on average, its core employees make up $8.90 an hour in New York.
No one touches less than them in this city.
For me, it’s inconceivable to live with that money in New York.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald’s after high school while living with their parents.
Few people saw it as their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald’s employees who complain about having to live on this salary and sometimes having to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, on the forum of the Wall Street Journal there are comments saying that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what you are going to feed them.
Protesters who launched the movement Thursday at 6:30 a.m. near McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and fast-food cooks be paid a minimum of $15 an hour, more than twice the current minimum wage.
They also called for unions to be established in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing union protesters with bullying or firing.
However, administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a union, grabbing fast food remains a difficult task, and for concrete reasons.
One of the main ones is the extraordinary rotation of the staff.
They don't agree
Other tumultuous demonstrations were held near several other fast food chains.
The highlight of the protest was the mid-day rally near McDonald’s in Times Square with the intervention of several local Democratic politicians, including City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: “McDonald’s announces selling billions of portions and after they don’t even give you sick leave and pay you the work you did honestly!”
The protesters were backed by other prominent New York Democrats, including mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio who said that “we all need to support fast food workers so they get a fair salary and the economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times characterized the event as the most important event in the fast food industry in its history.
But only a few hundred people participated, not all of them were fast food workers, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is difficult to say whether this spark of mass movement will make small ones.
“At the moment, we can only manage to fool the brain.”
Lately, fans of new technologies have become accustomed to perceiving augmented reality through special glasses.
Initially, Google unveiled its current model this summer at its annual conference and in November we learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it emerged from the interview with the director of the interactive 3D technologies group at the Microsoft Cambridge laboratory, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this company, the glasses are already ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, by creating open virtual spaces.
- Could you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We are working on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time we are trying to broaden the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has for the moment remained flat-screen pixels and sometimes touch.
We want to look 5 to 10 years ahead and guess the radical changes that will happen with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox today sells without Kinect because everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What does the future hold for us?
- Although Kinect has made physical interaction, a lot of things happen on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Information entry has been improved (the system receives more data), but performance, for now, is not really.
We’re trying to change that and we’re working on truly 3D imaging systems that work on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to take the computer world out of ours, into the physical world, make it more tactile.
For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space around him.
Thus, we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And to begin with, let’s get rid of these stupid virtual reality headsets!
- What do you think about voice control?
It’s appreciated, but isn’t it overrated?
One cannot say that it is the panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because one does not always want to inform others of his actions or intentions.
In fact, every type of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its niche.
For example, to order the devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought about gestures, not wide gestures, but rather discreet, restricted gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the camera, but by a bracelet worn in the hand that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: gesture + voice.
- What do you mean?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this can on to you?
You would do it with words and gestures.
- Usually, I'm just talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt based on what the machine can or cannot do at any given time?
- Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I think that very soon we will have to work on developing new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify human reactions.
These can be for example laser sensors, they produce a fairly good resolution in depth and this is very important.
If you’re interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what don’t you like about modern cameras?
Are they lacking resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, it is on the current generation that we rely in our work on 3D recognition.
It would obviously be good to get about 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Compared to this last point, all current technologies are quite good, this adds work to the designers of algorithms.
We must keep in mind the resolution along the X and Y axes, but also Z.
Speed also matters a lot, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and 30 c/s is really not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche of our Redmond lab gave the sensor touch a steady processing delay of between 1 and 100 s, with the current sensors closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how this influences the interaction of man and machine.
I would need a device of this type in my work, but not needing to touch, to have more frames per second.
But shouldn’t the number of cameras be increased?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second, a receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a usual sensor of the visible field.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
Many cameras could solve this problem.
Or make it worse by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to the Kinect, to play with the curve of the cameras and see how it could help define the locations.
As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not introduce its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that from the point of view of everyday use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most prospective platforms?
- Of course, walking all the time with a smartphone with your hands up is not practical but here is what I think: the best option would be a "transitory" augmented reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to switch from glasses to smartphone.
Glasses are a very personal device and that is what makes them strong (personal items are the only ones you see) and at the same time their weakness: augmented reality from glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is no longer accessible only to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the mere mortal.
There is a problem on which opponents of this idea point the finger: there is no tactile sensation!
The hands feel nothing!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my classes, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth might very well be the addition of tactile sensations.
For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as an image carrier.
It perfectly captures the pressures!
But there are also technologies that are actually intended to attribute palpability to these "images in the air": for example the interference of several ultrasound rays directed towards a precise point where the finger is and which gives you the sensation, for the moment still weak, of a breath of air on the tips of the fingers.
There are also bracelets worn on the wrists that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also an axis of work presenting perspectives.
- And you tried to trick the brain?
Make him believe that he feels what he should normally feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
There’s still a task down there that will have to be done for a long time: how to make someone who is physically in a very small space believe that he is walking in an almost infinite open space – we are working on the concepts of treadmills (nothing to do with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
At the moment, we can only manage to deceive the brain, there are still many years of work.
This is what makes the work on virtual reality so interesting to the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The reign of taste and not culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Petersburg avant-garde" dedicated to the city-dwellers who are ahead, at the forefront of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already welcomed eminent actors from the St. Petersburg art scene whose achievements extend beyond the city’s border and who have found recognition in Europe, having been known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extrovert painter Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, this rather bearded man, all dressed in red that can be seen near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or in the parties and trendy vernissages.
Kirill Miller’s paintings still bring together crowds, regardless of where they are exhibited.
He is one of the fundamentally social and philosophical Petersburg storytellers, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is an eminent representative of the Petersbourgeois avant-garde of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and puts them in a good mood.
He recently took an organ of barbarism into his hands and became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg since he had matured enough for this difficult role due to his existence, his philosophy and his image as a bohemian.
- Kirill, why do you walk around the city in red and not in yellow or turquoise blue for example?
- I chose red as a tailor specialized in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the image maker and society.
Even if in society, everything that is not gray arouses aggression and negative agitation.
But my provocations are meant to start the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
And when did you realize you had to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Palace of Culture Nevskiy where my works were.
I realized this was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial painters had passed and the new, free ones, in my kind, were misunderstood.
I began to befriend the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchchina that gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10" and then there was no wave anymore.
I am interested in theatre, fashion, music, all genres except words.
It was important for me to be at the center of St. Petersburg's culture where the best creative forces must come together.
In 1995, I took my place in Pushkinskaya-10, which was home to a musical and artistic club, a bohemian club, the home of the Petersburg Bohemian.
Many were born there: The NAME, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arrive with the project "Van Gogh's ear".
Chnour and his friends sang easy playback songs in loose-fitting jerseys, including Igor Vdovin, a composer now in fashion.
When the band started performing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg had a lot of shows before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and that was when his great career began, but his training and basic education was where he received them.
Gallery "D137", Club "Griboyedov": these are repercussions of the Art Clinic.
Our employees went there as usual.
I am a hero of the past century, of the time when culture meant something.
In 2000, a poll was organized in the press: it was the prize "The personalities of our city".
I was named Painter of the Year, and that was when my reign ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, one can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a very high topicality and acuity.
I'm going to have an exhibition programmed "The Russian Museum through the Clowns".
Clowns belong to a timeless category.
Before I was a social person, today it hurts and it scares me to be like that.
But with the clowns, everything fades, the tragic falls.
I like grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and compulsory disguise.
Today, it is the clothes that matter, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not inside the person.
Maybe we can't give him a hand, but we have to spit at him instead.
And the lie will be erased by disguise.
- Recently we saw you as the barbarian organ player. - A cultural city must have that kind of hero.
Who but me can play it.
- But maybe commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Today commercial art must be neat, delicate, liqueur.
A disintegration of culture is taking place.
Before, the people were divided into herds, the supporters of the bohemian loved one thing, the nonsense another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollar bill to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you're going to like.
Each star has 100 fans.
- But several thousand people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- It's people we threw out who come to see him, it's the sexual and social side that works.
But on the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles won't come, and in the end it's less management, less money, it's all gone.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil the experience.
When I was young, I painted paintings that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with paintings that are usually the ones you paint at the end of your life.
Today, ideas are often confused.
It is said: there is the spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused money just for painting.
I am for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the official of culture.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the reign of the good Tsars, it was not like that, the Tsars did not understand the culture well, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the good experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are dismissed, because they need higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and make a way for them.
Currently, it is the "kingdom of taste" that blooms.
The same Erarta, but they differ in that they honestly say that they do not take all the contemporary art, that there are painters who have to find other museums.
- For you, what is St. Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a soil for it.
And on our stones, art has a hard time pushing.
We need cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, that’s bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who will see exhibitions, concerts.
At home, this layer is very thin.
We must make art fashionable as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project carried out with the support of the St. Petersburg Scholarship
Birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Climate warming or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Caravans of space shuttles with Earthlings on board set out in search of a rescue planet.
To save humanity, a big question arises: how to continue to make our species live in weightlessness or on a rescue planet?
I don't think there's much choice.
There are actually two real planets that can be conquered, if only by hypothesis.
“This is Venus and Mars,” says Vladimir Sourdine, a researcher at the P.K. Chternberg State Astronomical Institute (GAICh).
If the conditions on Mars are more suitable for life, the surface temperature of Venus is 500.
You can only live there at very high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
We began to take an interest in the issues of reproduction in space by focusing on flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit did not differ in any way from Earth varieties.
Then, insects were put into orbit, small drosophilic breeding flies.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to see how a weightless embryo developed.
A completely normal chick is obtained at the exit.
Then the problems begin.
“The problem is that the chick has to find support, it has to get on its legs and start moving,” says Vladimir Sychev, director of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP).
Finding no support, the chicks agitated in a disorderly way.
And after 10 hours, the newborns saw their instincts completely atrophy.
The chicks reacted neither to the light nor to the sound.
Unfortunately, they would simply die after four days.
“We scoured their eyes twice, then gave up, because it’s simply impossible to work with them there,” says Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of the experiment with chicks in space.
The last biological miniature ark with animals was sent into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, the biosatellite " Bion " will only ship species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats sent with their fetus into space.
In principle, nothing supernatural has been discovered.
"It was still about the biosatellites and then it's the only experiment. We have to do this kind of research," notes Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats gave birth to their offspring.
However, it is still not possible to perform reproductions directly in space.
It's not a small deal.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instincts.
Unlike beasts, man is capable of doing so, in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, it is able to create a suitable emotional background.
This type of experiment is not carried out for ethical reasons.
Women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the female organism is what humanity has most precious.
Our seagull flew away and no one on Earth could tell if it would hold up after a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the robbery.
“No one answered that question,” says Vakhtang Vatchnadze, a retired rocket and space worker.
In June 1964, just a year after her flight into space, the first female cosmonaut Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolayev was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after having been twice in orbit and even working in an extra-vehicle environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk persists.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts who have had nothing and who give birth to a healthy offspring after long flights.
"And if they are longer, it poses a danger even during flights in orbit," concludes pilot and cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov.
Yet humanity must look for new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravitation.
Hydrology laboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Centre: mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in zero buoyancy, cosmonauts train at extra-vehicle exits.
The water imitates the weightlessness.
If for adults, the water is comfortable but nevertheless a foreign environment, for infants, it is their real element.
Small amphibious men seem to confirm this: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
Since the baby evolves about 9 months in the lymphatic fluid in his mother's belly, it is easier for him to get used to the water afterwards.
This is in principle logical, because from its birth to its first bath, it only takes 2 weeks.
“It’s very little to forget,” explains infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the child who has just been born the weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman needs gravitation, a force of weight.
In weightlessness, the muscles of the belly, pelvis atrophy very quickly, the baby's ability to push is lost.
All right, let's ignore that by relying on birth simulators.
You can of course prepare a delivery in a special room, the woman will get to get him out.
"And then?" asks Valeriy Poliakov to ask to reflect on this complex question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravitation.
If it does not feel the earth’s attraction, the body does not form the skeleton or the muscle system.
You can't dress an infant like an adult with a special combination for training.
He will simply be deprived of his vital needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case, imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will result in the return to Earth of a disabled child, completely disabled," said Igor Pestov, director of the Committee for Bioethics at the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
The birth of children in space is still theoretical.
However, in time this will become a reality, when the Earthlings will travel in their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their space-born offspring.
The head of the ISC (Higher Institution for the Control of Public Finances) said: “the control of pseudo-self-employment (in Czech “Svarc system”) has failed because of politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation, but is lagging behind when it comes to its application.
This is what Miloslav Kala, the vice president of the Higher Institution of Public Finance Control, said in an interview with Aktualn.cz.
“The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, that is what is lacking in us,” Kala said in his commentary on the current situation.
A joint inspection by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cites as an example of abusive practice the approach of the "varc system" by Petr Neșas.
The Prime Minister recently stated that the SDG is not going to bother entrepreneurs with controls, so is it permissible or prohibited?
“The law must be enforced in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of government cannot prevent an inspecting authority from acting to demand compliance with the law,” Kala said.
At the control committee meeting in the Chamber of Deputies, you referred to a Czech-German project in which the procurement laws of these two countries were compared.
What was it really about?
This is a parallel control that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for how to manage public procurement and specific national legislation, as well as a proper practice.
We have put all this together and although this control procedure has not yet been completed, very interesting differences have appeared to us: generally speaking, our legislation may be "more stringent and of better quality", however, according to some parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This therefore confirms that it is not enough to continuously elaborate increasingly detailed rules, but that it is necessary to devote oneself to the application of the law itself.
How can this project help you concretely and what does it mean for you?
This kind of joint control should help us to stop trying to clarify the laws, to lower and improve the thresholds, when this does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means obtaining the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But lowering the market thresholds will not necessarily achieve this goal.
It may be that this system is so overwhelmed by paperwork that those looking for its faults will find far more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You are talking about internal issues concerning the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system in Germany work?
Is there an institution similar to our CSI or a different mode of organization?
As for the institutions, similarly to the CIS, there is a similarly organised Bundesbildungshof, which also has a slightly different board, but these two institutions are basically similar.
The competences are also, to some extent, similar, but with a nuance compared to our system: Germany being a federal structure, it also has these types of account prices at the level of the different Länder.
The BRH can only control federal money, which corresponds to the resources of the state.
The public funds managed by the regions and municipalities are there controlled at the level of the Länder’s accounts.
As far as national legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas Germany is often referred to as a model but it certainly cannot be said to do better in all areas.
Maybe it's because they have better inspectors?
No, probably not, but I repeat, I don't have any comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country, which we consider to be a model, is also facing a whole series of problems.
Otherwise they wouldn't have any advantage in cooperating with our institution, would they?
As far as national legislation is concerned, what has the amendment of the Public Procurement Act meant for you as an institution, are its effects already being felt?
Since this amendment came into force relatively recently, it has not yet had an impact on our control operations.
As we do a posteriori checks, we must count on a certain delay.
Our comments concern only, for the moment, the process of preparing future controls - we have launched a new "mismanagement risk detection" instrument with which we have screened nearly 14,000 public contracts - that will of course be the case, because the thresholds have been changed as well as the conditions of certain types of tender procedures and so on.
So do you see the passage of this law as an advantage or an added burden to the administration?
I believe that this legislation is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm this.
The problem that can arise is that these rules become more stringent and that it is not possible to abide by them.
Already under the previous regulation, the claimant (e.g. the regional council, in the case of regional operational programs) forced the controlled parties to accept that any violation of the law on the markets meant a breach of budgetary discipline.
So is it really helpful to make the law tougher in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack the system or abuse it but not punish those who make formal mistakes without consequences on the decision-making process.
Such a system will put more pressure on the administration.
So what's the way out?
Let's look where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the SDG was not going to bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called ?varc system - what does that mean?
Is the VARC system prohibited or authorized?
The law must be enforced in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority from going to inspect and demand compliance with the law.
He can say, “We’re going to change the law and allow it,” but he can’t say that we’re going to act like nothing is wrong.
The Markets Act contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be performed, precisely in order to protect the call for tenders.
But it is also tragic that a bidder is eliminated solely because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and that is, in my opinion, what we lack.
The roads are sometimes frozen, but most are still practicable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also snowy.
However, the network remains largely practicable, in some places with increased vigilance.
Region of Karlovy Vary
In the Karlovy Vary area, roads were practicable this morning, but in places that were frozen and also snowy.
Temperatures have fallen and range between -5° and -10°C but they are expected to rise slightly in the day.
Snowfall has ceased in the area and only a thin layer of snow remains in the plains.
However, the peaks of the Metalliferous Mountains (Kruñé hory) are covered with about 30 centimetres of snow.
Data from the Regional Road Maintenance Service indicate that visibility was reduced in some areas due to fog.
The R6 highway and the national roads in the region are now easily accessible.
However, vigilance remains to be exercised, for example on certain bridges whose roofing can be frozen and slippery.
All departmental roads and third category lanes, including mountain roads, are also practicable.
There are still remnants of frozen snow on some of their stretches and in some places heavy traffic.
Especially in high-altitude areas, drivers need to be more vigilant.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
The Highways and Highways Directorate reports on its website that some East Bohemia roads are threatened by ice formation and that traffic-stuffed snow can be found on roads in mountainous areas and at altitudes.
Road maintenance services warn drivers of the risk of ice formation in high-altitude areas of the Pardubice region.
There may be ice in the vicinity of Lanokroun, Orlicí, Polioka, Svitavy or Vysoké Móto, mainly on departmental and third category roads.
Routes I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy were chemically treated.
Snow is found mainly in the Giant Mountains (Krkono?e) and the Eagle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kn?nou and Trutnov, a layer of traffic-stuffed snow is present on the roads in the highlands.
In Eastern Bohemia, the weather today will be dry, most often clear, with possible cloudy passages.
It will blow a weak wind and temperatures will generally range between -3° and +1°C.
Region of Pilsen
Roads in the Pilsen region are now practicable, although in some places increased vigilance and adaptation of driving to weather conditions are required.
It freezes this morning, temperatures range between -3 ° and -9 ° C.
After the last snowfall and the cooling that followed, some communication routes can be in frozen places.
Drivers can expect to cross fog areas, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is revealed by information from the regional road maintenance service.
The D5 motorway is easily accessible, but road maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between 80 and 131 kilometres.
The cladding of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some stretches can be frozen in the South Pilsen District and Tachov District.
The departmental and third category lanes are wet and in this case the warning against frozen sections applies.
Drivers must be vigilant, especially on the less crowded roads of the Umava region.
Region of Olomouc
Drivers travelling to the high-altitude areas of the Olomouc region must now count on a layer of thick, soft snow on the roads.
This layer remained on the so-called "Cervenohorské sedlo" pass and on the road to Videlsk??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
The snowfall forced road maintenance personnel to go to the ground that night; according to road services, it fell more than three centimeters in the district of Umperk.
In other parts of the region, most of the pavements are easily accessible.
"On the heights of the district of Umperk are snow remains.
Drivers driving towards Jeseník are expected to encounter a layer of thick, soft snow at the pass called "Cervenohorské sedlo", the head of road maintenance services in the district of ?umperk said today.
Their colleagues from the Jeseník district also visited the site overnight; according to them, after the chemical treatment, the roads are now clear and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the district of Olomouc the roads are easily accessible, in the district of Aternberk the drivers should however be careful in the forested sections with the roads left wet.
Regions of Ostí nad Labem and Liberec
As early as this morning, road maintenance services in North Bohemia reported several difficult sections.
According to police data, in addition to some areas covered with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na ?steku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below freezing at lower altitudes, so snow and ice should remain on the roads. In the plains, especially southeast of the Central Plateau of Bohemia, there are, on the contrary, no problems and the roads are generally dry.
No traffic difficulties have been reported at this time.
Road maintenance services have reported the presence of ice, particularly in the vicinity of the city of ?t??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
According to meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snow melt during the day, clear sky and frost during the night.
Difficult conditions are also reported from the main traffic lanes on National Route 13 on the border between the regions of Ostí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of the traffic between Telnice and Knínice is due to branches of trees that curved under the weight of snow until reaching the pavement.
Ornest said: “In concert, we want to collect positive energy.”
What do you think of the fact that in less than a month this should be the end of the world?
This is just one of those alarming news, the kind of traps we like to fall into.
In our group, The Tap Tap, we joke about it and think that we are the only group that can collect a remnant of positive energy in order to push back or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December you will be mounting a very unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce this project to our readers in more detail?
This is a charity that we have been preparing for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced for December 21 at 11 a.m.
The day before, on December 20, three concerts will take place simultaneously, in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will almost end when the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati, which is in the Pacific Ocean, in a time zone 12 hours ahead of us.
Who came up with that idea?
At first I thought it was my idea, then we designed it all with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want together, with the public, to reflect on the state of the world we leave to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we created a collection of unique items including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, by buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap with other performers also recorded an anthem against the end of the world entitled "End of the World Cancelled" (in Czech "Konec sv?ta zru?eno").
She’s already very popular on YouTube, will it be heard at these charity concerts as well?
Of course, all in the end, finally, if we succeed and that the end of the world does not happen ...
It will be sung simultaneously by all the performers in all three concerts.
The anthems will also come together at some point as part of a very unique live broadcast by Czech television.
The lyrics for this song were written by Tomas Hanak who also plays the lead role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X also sings there...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other Czech showbiz personalities, due to the fact that we organize many concerts and charitable events...
We strive to involve them intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it amuses them.
What will be the benefit of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the Studeo training center, which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we have been working on in the framework of the Jedlyka Institute, with the Tap association, and this for six years.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the Jedlikov Institute and offer them activities that interest and amuse them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedli?ka Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Will several music groups and performers be on stage at each of these concerts?
By what criteria do you choose them?
We have tried to develop a program that caters to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Ji? Such? will be on stage.
You can find all the details at www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other “mega-events” of this kind in the future?
In May we will be playing for the first time in the Prague Spring; here too we will surely prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year at the home of the Czech Republic in New York and personally, once there in the United States, I would love to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not as bad as it looks at first.
We have five members in electric chairs whose machines have to travel in the hold, of course we also carry a lot of luggage and instrument boxes.
So far everything has been more or less always going well, British Airways and SA were always perfectly prepared for us, they have astonished me more than once.
Even in Moscow, from where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to your trips abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of accessibility facilities for people with reduced mobility, public attitudes towards people with disabilities and so on.
What have been your experiences so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we have just witnessed in Moscow that in the east all are still in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very poorly accessible to people with disabilities; there, it is not yet common for a person to travel alone in an electric chair in the center of the city.
They do not yet consider it an obvious priority to give a person in a chair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities is being created.
What more do we need to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are a lot of things we are still late for...
It is important to note that improvements and enhancements always depend on the efforts of those involved.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a heavy disability to move alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
However, it is not very common there for a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather at the forefront of progress!
Respect for the public and ease of access are one thing, but the situation will really start to change when we have among us famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers.
At the moment, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, let’s go back a few years, what prompted you in 1998 to create this group?
I started working as an educator at the Jedli?ka Institute, where I found myself surrounded by a lot of young people willing to invest in something.
And since I am a musician myself (I play, among other things, saxophone), with a colleague, we created a music activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator, Láa Angelovic, says, we have a little lost control of the situation (laughs).
Success has only happened in recent years, if I am not mistaken?
It’s true, building relationships with well-known singers and actively working to promote the band has helped us.
We understood that if a work is not visible, it is as if it does not exist in the background.
Thanks to the grants from the European Union, we can, in addition, afford to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you aim to achieve such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt there was potential to change things.
Show business is full of things that copy each other.
In a way, it makes sense: everything new is accepted with caution and it lasts a long time.
There are few original projects, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it is natural ...
But pity is totally useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering beings, abandoned by all, that we must take pity on.
These are people who can live a life of their own and thrive, provided they have the necessary means of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities manage to achieve something, it is not only a step forward for them but for the whole society.
Is not your success also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we must be uncompromising in many areas and demand some discipline.
But I think that's completely normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize they have to come to rehearsals twice a week, take preparatory classes and spend a lot of time on the roads for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them were there in 1998?
There is only one, Lá?a Angelovi?
We are an open group, people go in and out, we can’t do anything about it.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would like to join us.
This will be the day before the scheduled day of the end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012 from 9 p.m.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba Arena, in Brno in Fléda and in Ostrava in the Plynojem with the participation of twelve bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relay when The Tap Tap's song "End of the World Cancelled" is sung jointly.
The purpose of the concert is to raise funds (up to CZK 25 million) to equip the multifunctional Studeo training center in Prague in the Jedli?ka Institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, admission is free for children up to 12 years old, the presale of tickets is open at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the Cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as the 20th member of this agency, it is the second Member State of the former Eastern Bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had begun close collaboration with ESA in 1994 and in the following years participated in a number of ESA projects.
However, the road from Poland to space began much earlier.
Even before World War II, passionate Poles were working on spaceflights; they did not always meet with understanding.
I would like to mention, for example, the lecture by A. Aternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas from his avant-garde work entitled "Introduction to Astronautics".
The development of this young engineer (born in 1905) left the listeners cold and years later, Aternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Aternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize in France for his book "Introduction to Astronautics".
The so-called Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a major propagator of astronomy and astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books on this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a world-renowned propagator of astronautics, his contribution was notably rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters on the moon's hidden face.
In 1925 a draught was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
It is also unclear whether the rocket should be used to propel or brake the draisin.
The only known information about this draught is that of the press at the time.
From 1933, Polish artillery began to devote itself to rockets.
The research was conducted by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
The records show that this research has reached the testing stage.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the search stopped.
In 1937, plans for a photoelectric fighter rocket, drawn by engineer Rohozi?ski, appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were for military use with rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects for the use of rocket technology were conducted by the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee ("Tymczasowy Komitee Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all work.
This committee had been established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.
After the war, further work on aeronautics was published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, there is talk of a company in the November 1954 issue of Problem, in which there are four more detailed articles devoted to aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society dedicated to astronautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research had a future.
In early 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) made efforts to join the International Astronautical Federation (created in 1951) and by autumn, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He remained in office until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the RM meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first model, the RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This rocket with a range of 1800 meters was 80 cm long and weighed just under 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version, the RM-1A, was built and, during the summer of 1959, flight tests of the two-story RM-2 rocket began in the Bledov Desert.
This rocket was 1.4 meters long and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The next prototype should have been able to perform concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have a range of up to 14.5 km and be used to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was halted.
The Meteor-1 rocket developed during the period 1962 - 1965, succeeded the first RM type rockets.
This rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of the space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space offering a volume of 0.4 liters, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 liters and in Meteor-1C 0.62 liters.
The maximum range of all these types of craft was 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the aeronautical institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
Later, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is still worth mentioning the entry of Poland into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
As part of the Interkosmos program, Poland also participated in space exploration on artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimír Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of this program.
Repealing the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Works Act.
This decision has raised a lively debate in the public opinion.
It is certainly interesting to look at this issue from a broader point of view.
Economic systems geared towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This concretely means that the various economic entities as well as the national economic systems are perpetually in conflict with each other.
This results from the principle of free trade and the (unlimited) free movement of private capital coupled with unbridled financial speculation.
Significant differences in the price of labour (wages) create a strain on prices.
It should be understood that a producer strives by importing low-priced goods to withstand economic competition by "making" the competitor's price more expensive, in order to take a greater share of the market and thereby increase his own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transferring production abroad, or buying cheaply, or disappearing. The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it generates, the social charges of the State necessarily increase.
This whole situation intensifies the perfect unwillingness of the gentlemen entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damage caused to the whole of society by this race for profit.
This situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital generate in different economies a situation in which the governments of different countries are forced to engage in mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to their homes.
In other words, governments put their own people at the mercy of private capital without taking into account social collapse.
This is mainly reflected in the amendments to the laws in force.
The objective is to economically compel its own population to accept the price dictation of private capital, especially in the field of wages.
This is due on the one hand to a system of economic constraints in the event of long-term unemployment and on the other hand to the restriction of workers' rights in the field of labour legislation.
The result is growing poverty and deepening differences between rich and poor.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, there have been public food distribution points for the poor who cannot support themselves with their own work.
There are already millions of these people.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it is becoming quite common for employees to receive such salaries that the state is forced to pay a supplement to reach the vital minimum.
Such a scandal, for example, has been updated in the case of employees working as auxiliaries in the federal parliament.
The economic measures of virtually all southern EU Member States undoubtedly generate a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or to live with salaries of misery, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day their private country will invest in them.
The question here is: where does this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will pass from one country to another; that capital may not come either, or else a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or an African will continue to work for a fraction of a European salary.
This also applies to the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media claim, to get tired of it, that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the directed economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital strongly defends the idea that the state cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
It is therefore necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence and even govern today, according to its own selfish interests, politics and thereby the entire state.
The answer to that question is undoubtedly yes.
The evidence is that there is a virtually all-powerful lobby that is present in all states.
The result is a desperate situation manifesting itself in the field of corruption, in the granting of mutual benefits, in legislation, where everything is condemnable but not punishable.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, the situation is such that due to a lack of financial resources, national ministries delegate the development of draft laws to law firms closely related to the industry.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, as Western-style constitutions declare, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is evident that democracies oriented towards liberalism are now rapidly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his work entitled "The Crisis of the Roman Empire at the Time of Caesar and Pompey": "The state was long ago in disrepair and the functions were assigned by violence.
Bribery, illegally obtained favors, and stones and swords were also used to obtain these positions.
The under-the-table and the corruption proliferated without limits and the people went to the elections with absolute votes already sold. ... ... “Honest people did not seek to obtain office, the result was once the state remained 8 months without consuls.” ... ‘ We really began to say that the remedy to this difficult situation was autocracy, and that we had to choose a true man.
In conclusion, as in antiquity, today's society is based on the preference of personal profit, without regard to the interest of society as a whole.
In essence, private capital is no longer capable of understanding and asserting the interests of society as a whole.
The result is, today as before, an unprecedented decadence of the elites, without any effort to carry out in-depth reforms.
We must therefore look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalization of the economic systems of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
As things now stand, the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of liberal-style democracies can be seen as a kind of pause before a new stage.
The fact that today’s elites are completely ignorant of the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future loss of life, the humanitarian and social crises we are witnessing today as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and recent history.
Repealing the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and internally, the Czech government will be forced to continue to look for ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution consists of socio-political reforms, which will strengthen state capital investments in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
“Nothing will ever come out of the violence and it will never be,” Sting says in the song titled Fragile whose main line in the chorus is “let’s not forget how fragile we are.”
“If my sons didn’t want wars, there wouldn’t be,” said Gutele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on her deathbed in 1849.
Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions have arisen.
Some take the side of Israel, arguing for its right to self-defense and placing the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, citing the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and viewing Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is the victim, in its waves of recurrent killings; after all, the present inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in the present political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence.
I would like to offer readers a point of view "behind the curtain" on the one that mainly benefits from the tensions that have already persisted for more than 95 years (starting with the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small section of countries in the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available for study, others emerge from my own understanding of the one, or more precisely the group of individuals, who is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is above all the history of a struggle for power.
In every age we can find a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individuals acted independently or whether they owed their acts to someone who directed their actions according to previously defined goals.
We must admit that we are living in a time when global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this financial concentration that generates certain powers has not been possible in a single generation.
Among the families possessing astronomical wealth stands out particularly the Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the octopus (I do not know if these families still have a leader but I do not exclude him).
Little is written about them.
Of course.
As early as the 1990s, they acquired the world’s first news agency (Reuters) in order to end the link between their names and the serious criminal acts they were involved in, which had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase in their fortune or both.
They have major holdings in almost most central banks of the world and are preparing or waging wars against countries in which they do not yet have such holdings (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries were 7, after the invasion of Iraq of 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only 4, meanwhile Russia placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to stand up against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Rothschild Bank of America’s status as a central bank and began issuing his own money during the Civil War (government, I mean) and was assassinated in a theater in 1865.
JFK began issuing clean money and wanted to dissolve the Fed, he was assassinated in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 while he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for power worldwide led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a 33rd degree Freemason, being the highest level.
The first war aimed to eliminate the great state monarchies of Europe, the second was to eliminate colonialism, especially British, and the third was to reduce the world population by between 1 and 0.5 billion individuals (such a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (ecumenism being nothing but the beginning of such an ultimate solution, and acquire such an ultimate power).
The method used by the clan of the richest families with the Rothschilds at their head is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order following chaos).
These solutions are false and still lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the Fed to prevent crises such as those they provoked in 1907).
After succeeding in triggering the First World War by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended abruptly with a German capitulation without economic and military justification (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For an easier outbreak of the Second World War, the bankers allowed the politicians to create a situation of latent conflict: on the one hand, they imposed on Germany a huge war reparations, thus generating the conditions for a radicalization of the impoverished masses (they then had to place a sufficiently energetic leader, showing the finger of the culprits, proposing the simple solutions).
In the late 19th century, the Rothschield inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches aspired to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration mentioned above laid the foundations for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first frictions with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
World War II broke out; it is difficult to appreciate whether Hitler broke the chains in which the international bankers had originally held him; or if everything he did was planned, the fact is however that the sufferings of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way that the war reparations imposed on Germany were the origin of the Second World War, the foundation of the State of Israel lit a fire pit that could cause a third World War.
If the international bankers succeed in starting this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like an immense laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but internationally (it is enough to see how people divide bitterly between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where one wrong causes another harm according to a circle of endless violence and where one finds, at the origin of everything, the greed of certain individuals and their desire to acquire power over the whole world?
Here we must distinguish between the simple citizens of Israel and their leaders, because, as in our country, the international bankers only propose to the people in the elections their own candidates.
The current prime minister of Israel is a typical example of a fascist, loyal global politician who is only 20% loyal to international bankers, who is doing everything in order to start a war with Iran, which could, due to the country's membership in the Shanghai cooperation organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc...) expand to become a world conflict and, given that Iran's control of the world
David Rockefeller once said, “The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order.”
In their view, the New World Order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of finance aristocrats are served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth an electronic chip making him a totally controlled being.
Let them compel all individuals, small and large, rich and poor, free and enslaved, to wear on their hands or foreheads a red-iron mark, so that they may neither buy nor sell the one who does not bear the name of this fierce beast or the number of his name.
It must be understood that he who has common sense counts the numbers of this fierce beast.
This number denotes the man and it is six hundred and sixty-six.”
The Argo movie: When everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a mob of protesters composed of Islamist students stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, which had been supporting his regime for several decades.
The situation did not offer the American administration a positive outcome, in fact it could not abandon the Shah, because it would have seriously undermined the trust of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to secure the release of the hostages.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, a blow further aggravated later by the fiasco of the attempt to release the hostages by force.
The abducted diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate aroused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment in the United States.
The Iranian debacle contributed greatly to Jimmy Carter's defeat to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo, by actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered a small victory to America.
Just before she was occupied, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After difficult journeys, they found themselves in the residence of the Ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran thanks to a rocky cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a film crew who came to make snippets for the shooting of a great sci-fi movie.
Combination of genres
The plan of exfiltration expert Tony Mendez required the collaboration of Hollywood.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized magazines reported on this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictional production company had real offices.
Details of the operation remained secret for a long time, the film being based on memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is an unusual combination of several genres.
It is a realistically conceived political thriller but also a "caper movie", the story of a successful stroke, a treachery - as, for example, in the Ocean's eleven, twelve and thirteen trilogy.
The atmospheres follow one another: documentary-style Tehran sequences (in the subtitled sequences are presented iconic photographs of the time of events and the way in which, thanks to these photos, these same situations have been transcribed in the film, there are no big differences),
lighter passages of Hollywood, treated with irony and a little exaggeration,
and then scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the hallways and on the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in a remarkable way.
As a ridiculed actor, he became a respected director and his acting has ceased to arouse ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the dark policeman "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The Town" (2010).
It's also Affleck's first film that doesn't take place in his hometown, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed his first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of atmosphere in Argo where the role of Tehran is "held" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, during the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the embassy fall is impressive by its clarity which also suggests confusion and unpredictability occurring when suddenly, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his collaborators get a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the fake film crew in the Tehran bazaar).
Too many actions in too many places
The director had to be content with a subject offering in fact few thrilling scenes, in the cinematographic sense of the term.
It does very well, it sometimes adds some elements to the reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at the airport in Tehran is dismissed by a phone call in America and the pursuit on the runway are quite pulled by the hair).
Argo's weakness lies in his dissipated character, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
While it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood co-operators, their characters would have deserved a bigger place and they are not, by far, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of dramatic tension, he lets himself be seen with moderate interest, appreciating the direction and retro style of the 70s.
He trains the spectator, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a story still, in a way, unfinished to date, and as an illustration of the exaggerated character of the portrayal of the secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, he does the job.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually conducts a public inquiry into the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to launch the settlement contest or ideas from the most absurd “EU workshop”.
“The fact that the EU has recently been considering adopting a 40 percent quota of women for the management of major European companies has led to our decision,” said the organiser of the survey, Patrik Nacher.
Among the absurdities mentioned, there is already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
Until now, however, women have benefited from life insurance rates because they objectively represent a lower risk for insurance companies.
People can report until the end of the year any other such incredible idea of the "EU workshop".
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Among the controversial EU regulations is, for example, the obligation to add bio components to fuels, which has harmful consequences for the environment, or the prohibition on the use of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of a dangerous substance or the directive on the size of chicken cages, which has led to an increase in prices.
Criticism has also been levelled in the past against a de facto ban on the use of the term "strawberry" or the withdrawal from the sale of conventional bulbs.
Quality bananas should be 14 centimeters in size.
The European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose demands are usually defended in Brussels by a state or a group of states (so the Czech Republic currently imposes the demands of its banks by threatening to use its veto).
The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, at the root of the fact that bananas in the Union must not be less than 14 cm in size or have an "abnormal curvature".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was only harmonizing non-homogeneous national standards that made trade more difficult.
Fruit and vegetable standards have been relaxed despite opposition from some states, claiming that existing directives result in food waste.
The first prize can be awarded in this survey to last year’s EU regulation that should feature on inflatable balloons a warning that children under 8 should not swell without adult supervision.
The EU referred to a U.S. survey that balloons are among toys the leading cause of choking deaths of children.
A similar restriction applies to children under the age of 14 when it comes to blowing in fair trumpets.
We have weird ideas here, too.
The following rule concerning the European officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this theme for Greece, anyone with an official function within the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and must instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the association "Laissez-Fare" of liberal economists, the Bankovnípoplatky.com server named in this investigation, in addition to some of the absurdities mentioned above, the EU regulation on the volume of food reserves in the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food stocks that could be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volumes fixed for canned mushrooms and risked a heavy fine.
The organizers of this survey found the idea of paying money to certain countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting grants to apply for grants interesting.
These ideas, however, did not originate from Brussels but from Prague.
“The fact that we don’t have a sea handicaps us.
We are going to ask the European Union for a refund," said Jaroslav Palas, Minister of Agriculture at the time.
He argued that because of our wheat production, and because of the so-called "interventionist" purchases, the State had found itself with full stocks that it had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from ports.
In the end, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech demand and organised a tender for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
The grants for grants were proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development led by Minister Pavel Näämec (US-DEU), which were, in practice, to be used to draft grant applications granted by Brussels.
The EU declares: "Odd regulations are rare".
While regulations are often criticised in Member States, many experts say, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the EU's functioning and overall development deserve praise.
More serious, for example, is, according to experts, the problem of using EU subsidies for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration, but which have been imposed by the Member States during budget negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other EU countries, must fight in Brussels for the right to use specific denominations for these traditional products (from which it does not always come out victorious) arouses strong emotions among the Czechs.
If at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomoucké tvar?ky", as for the name "Tuzemsk? rum" that goes back to us in the nineteenth century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzemák".
Only products based on cane sugar alcohol, and not on beet sugar, may bear the name rum.
In the official list of EU registered products, today we find together with world-renowned cheeses such as Feta or Gorgonzola ("Marzipan of Lübeck or Parma ham), cookies of Karlovy Vary ("Karlovarské sucary"), carp of Poho-elice and T-ebo-Po.
Pardubice Spice Bread ("Pardubick's perník") and cakes called "Ho'ice's Cornets" ("ho'ické trubi'ky") can also be proud of their community mark.
People want me to save the Republic, but I’m just an amateur, says Senator Okamura
Senator, how do you come up with the idea of running for president?
It's not being a senator or a president that matters to me.
If everything worked smoothly in our country, I wouldn’t be a candidate anywhere.
But I can no longer stand to see how the country has been looted for the past twenty years, that thieves are not under lockdown and taxes and retirement age are rising.
I didn’t have the ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something I don’t like, then I try to come up with a solution to make it change.
And since I am over forty years old and I am an independent member of no party, I have no other way to influence the situation than to run for office in the presidential or senatorial elections.
You entered the Senate but quickly set out for the Château (N.d.T.: seat of the presidency).
Do you not turn your back on those who elected you?
I've always said that I'll start the battle for the Castle according to the results of the Senate election.
Later, I made it clear that if I were elected senator, I would run for president.
My goal is not function, it is only an instrument that allows me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the widest mandate.
The problem is not only that we as a nation are laughing at the bar or in front of our TV set, but also that we are trampling on those who are trying to make change.
Added to this is the press that breaks people’s reputations and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, I have been told that I bribe journalists or that I was the adviser to Ji? Paroubek.
Let's come to your visions.
You have started the fight for the Castle with as a battlehorse the themes of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax declarations beyond twenty million [of CZK].
You have to change the law to that end.
As president, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose legislation.
How do you solve this problem?
When I, as a citizen, pressed for tourism guide activities to be a liberal profession, I won.
The problem is politics: when someone arrives from the left or the right with a good project, it is knowingly rejected and it delays the citizens.
As an independent member of no party, I am much more likely to get the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able, without categorization and dogma supporters, to take from each side the best for our country and implement it.
Do you see yourself as a man of the right or the left?
From a Czech point of view, I feel like people are putting me on the left.
For me, whether it’s a little left or right, it’s not really important.
The important thing for me is that we move forward.
What matters to me is not that people are on the left or the right, but to bring people together.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or the SDGs and I act equally impartially against bad ideas.
Do you get angry when someone says you are a populist?
But does not what you said prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have a certain optimal purpose and vision.
You're trying to get closer to it.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I’m talking about have been applied by the world and recognized experts have talked about it.
But without the support of parliament, you only have slogans left.
You won’t survive long in politics with that.
Do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, in imposing material and criminal responsibility?
I have no other choice.
I have to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to rally them to my side in order to impose it.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the presidents of parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
Maybe they should explain why they don’t want it.
When there is a strong personality who will identify the abuses, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take for example the election of the president by direct vote, it was obtained thanks to the pressure of public opinion.
I confess, without hesitation, to be an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I’ve just gotten into politics and I’m trying to get the majority’s support for my program.
I'm trying to move things forward on my own, and if it doesn't work out, I'll stop in six years and go back to the private sector.
It's kind of like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that one person can't make a difference, which is why I went to a number of personalities to ask them to run in the Senate as well.
I met Radim Janura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
I at least supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who revealed the oil frauds.
I introduced myself because people are really unhappy but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote and what they did did, for the most part, gave their voice to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are two independents.
People have elected a Senate that can hardly impose change.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example the direct election of mayors and prefects of regions.
Are you planning to start your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check if each potential member's past is spotless and then I don't have the financial means.
I also don’t have money for my presidential campaign, I only have twenty thousand on my “transparent” account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about tax returns, what's yours?
I estimate the value of my personal property at about 60 million.
I have in Prague a piece of land worth 25 million, an apartment worth ten million, another apartment worth eight million, a collection of works of art worth about ten million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Skoda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
By the way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a kid’s dream: I’ve always loved James Bond, who was riding in a car, being gallant with women and fighting evil and abuse.
You ride in Aston Martin, you have a fortune worth $60 million and you don't have money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you don’t want to invest your own money in it?
It's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for this campaign.
Should I be in debt?
I've already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my program does not attract much interest.
I don't have to pay for this campaign out of my pocket.
My campaign costs are generally covered by the remuneration I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn’t live on it, for example paying for my son’s English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If my only goal was to make money, I won't run for election.
Are you going to continue your business activities in order to live?
Didn't you say you'd put your activities under control?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I partially cut back on my activities.
For example, my assistant will take over the management of the travel agency in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live on something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I was winning and I continue to win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would end my business.

The architects of the MVRDV firm prove that real adventures are not just a matter of imagination. To convince themselves, it is enough to contemplate Spijkenisse and the newly erected mountain of books - 2 photos
“I think this building is funny, it’s very futuristic, finally something interesting to see,” says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by on the side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist at a large nearby company, tells us: "Yes, this building is indeed beautiful."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has Internet, an iPad and e-books.
Today, no one is willing to go to one of these lame libraries anymore, right?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory town that has nothing attractive at the gates of Rotterdam, holds a fairly special record.
The municipality of 80,000 souls has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to give back some neurons to the brains, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and to reproduce the seven fictional bridges that appear on the euro banknotes in the form of pretty small painted reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the cultural offensive remained limited.
This is how the city authorities realized that there was only one way to get hold of the statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, of the Rotterdam architects' office MVRDV, master of bold stick diagrams and creator of witty and often cynical buildings, accepted the project with his usual phlegm and ran for the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a laugh on his face.
And while the members of the jury were still looking at each other, bewildered and shrugging their shoulders, the brash Maas stacked his books of choice in order of size to make it a pyramid, and ended his speech supported by activist arguments by a: "common dear!"
Here it is, my proposal for the Spijkenisse mountain of books, or as they say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the €30 million mountain sprang from the ground.
The building is part of a revitalization project that also includes underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and adjoining houses for a total of 50 dwellings.
In early November, the mountain of books received the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This dull little town, which until today had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a town hall of haughty ugliness, whose white facades invite us to think that they are home to a dairy, has been enriched with contemporary architectural work.
Most importantly, Spijkenisse now owns the first public cultural building in its history.
The long road to reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under a cheese bell.
Admittedly, an elevator transports you to the heart of the massif, but the real joys of reading and architecture open to you when you step on the floor of the building to discover its topography.
The interior entirely made of glass is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floor and the elegant street lights speak unequivocally the language of the municipal public squares.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We are already looking at public benches, dogs and little boys and girls playing ball.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
“Normally, the library shelves are along the façade and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal,” Maas says.
We have completely disrupted the classic spatial configuration and opened up the reading spaces from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain of books has been aptly designed: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the center for the environment and the technical center of the building.
Of particular beauty lies in the black beams of the library, which are sometimes paneling, sometimes balustrades, sometimes stair railings.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even hardened architects and building engineers don’t want unknown materials.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” says Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
So one day we found an ad hoc waste from agriculture in a frizzy farm.
In the Netherlands, one millimeter thick synthetic membrane has been used for years as a substrate in greenhouses and fields.
It is cheap and we save time.
The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons, then it can be discarded.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, into plates with a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the effect of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and transforms into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, whose smell evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
At the end of almost 500 meters, the literary café offers a breathtaking view of the city, but also Dutch croquettes and ficus in pots.
The latter create an atmosphere, but they mainly contribute to the maintenance of the ideal level of air humidity of the literary mountain.
Gifts for the New Soul
“It’s incredible, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model project in terms of ecology,” says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is regulated by geothermal.
Although the mountain of books lies beneath a glass bell, the sun only lights up the interior for a short time, even on good weather days.
Thick wooden beams mounted crosswise with respect to the glass façade serve as a sunscreen, intercepting much of the rays.
The ambiance is very pleasant.
Fully automated blinds take care of the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the aforementioned septic computer scientist, has already risked entering the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was also there.
Cynthia Bogarde, a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even describes Boekenberg as Spijkenisse’s “finally found soul.”
A few weeks ago, at the inauguration, every citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This measure made it possible to fill the voids of the library that was not yet fully filled (now it has 70,000 books).
The concept is a success.
The rays are overflowing from all sides.
For architect Winy Maas, “there is nothing worse than a half-empty library.”
“I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between every citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it’s just for decoration.”
This is how MVRDV achieved the master discipline called, in professional jargon, "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse has written a new page of literary history.
She may seem young and uneducated.
Finally, it is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "Germans need to play a bigger role."
Germany chose to abstain in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian state.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-EU relations, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany announced its intention to vote against the Palestinians’ request to obtain observer status with the United Nations.
But then she chose abstention.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what the Israelis did in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be cautious as it has special relations with Israel.
But I also think it does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, but was not overly critical of Israel.
During the insurgency in Libya in March 2011, Germany also chose to abstain in the vote on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
Is Germany having difficulty adopting a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason for this is that Berlin is revising its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy so-called defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans are fighting on several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still trying to find this role, but they are on the path to a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as in France or Great Britain
What does the term “normal” foreign policy mean to Germans?
It shows a willingness to adopt positions independent of those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to national issues.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, therefore by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are, to a certain extent, different from those of the other great powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced Germany's position on the Middle East conflict and abstention from the United Nations vote?
Germany first has important opportunities in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to offend the public opinion, but also the elites of the Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a decisive factor.
However, I would not attach too much importance to this, as it is not an exclusively unilateral relationship.
But this is in any case a decisive element in German strategic thinking.
Does Germany undermine its relations with the United States by choosing abstention in important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think Europeans and Americans understand the German position perfectly.
That is why I think the fracture is not as serious as it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Maybe even Germany will be more respected.
Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, views on the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
However, the United States announced its veto with a clear voice.
Do opinions differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences because of the domestic American political scene.
I believe that the Obama Administration is secretly showing great understanding of the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, of course, the government cannot defend its position publicly.
I believe that the true differences of opinion are not so great as they always appear to be.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from overflowing with enthusiasm for Netanyahu’s policy.
Is Germany having difficulty reconciling its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners on the other?
I don't think that makes it easy for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little simpler for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, but today it is not.
They cannot therefore form part of a larger political line and must assert their singular position.
This is what they are currently doing on the issue of the euro.
In my opinion, Germany will in the future take on the role of locomotive and push Europe to adopt a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, especially because of its relations with Israel.
This question has always been a tricky one.
But in my opinion, the Germans are well aware that they must play a role that further marks their independence.
Does Germany play a leading role on the international stage, does Germany only want to play a key role?
Or does she still have difficulty taking on leading roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still struggling to play a bigger role.
If you look, for example, at the euro crisis, you notice that every time Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German sentiments are heard.
It doesn’t make things easier for the Germans.
In fact, it is always the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
It has to deal with very varied neighbors and opinions, and it is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European politics is only diminishing, but right now, the EU is not filling this void, so who remains?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
And even if they don’t like it, even if they don’t like it and they are less appreciated, it’s life!

'Mark Protection' in China: When Puma and Armani Suddenly Become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are well-known brands around the world.
Armani Polo... what is it really about?
Behind this name is a trademark officially registered in China, but which has nothing to do with the original company.
The trade mark thus enjoys such protection that the company bearing its name cannot file a complaint.
And even if she could, she's not sure she'd win.
“It’s increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China,” said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, a law firm specializing in property infringement in the Far East.
Every week, a new file arrives on my desk.
Imitators only need a few extra letters to register their trademarks.
Thus, instead of Gucci, we record Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, we record Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sports goods.
Pattloch opens a workbook in which the registrations made with the Beijing Trademark Office are located.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company registered the brand Zegna DF Puma, a name that the company artificially created by taking over part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a known fact that the Chinese have become the world champions of copying and intellectual property infringement.
In large cities, there are multi-storey shopping malls that sell practically only counterfeits.
Pattloch’s cases, however, are different: his constituents charge him with tackling the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office officially gives Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of "Bang Mingpai", a parent brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
It is with this term that are designated women who marry rich men.
Chinese officials say they have nothing to blame.
"It's bad for business, we have to fight this trend," Pattloch demands.
“The brand is sweetened, the singularity disappears, the damage to reputation is enormous.”
Financial losses and legal costs amount to millions for the sectors concerned, especially for expensive flagship products.
According to data from market analysis company CLSA, China is the third fastest growing market for luxury goods with an annual volume of 15 billion euros.
However, it is not easy to delete questionable trademark registrations and these procedures are expensive.
The latter can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch refers to the trials in which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long period of time, the denomination criticized had become a "market reality".
Pattloch explains that if the complainant is out of luck, he may even be forced to pay money to the plagiarist, as he would have harmed his brand in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle against construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the same company that had just bought concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
This is why the Chinese can use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
Geely, the purchaser of Volvo, used a blue-and-white logo that resembled that of BMW. The conflict was resolved and Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste fashion house had lost against plagiarists from Hong Kong and Singapore who had refocused the famous crocodile’s gaze in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
However, the CTMO brand office in Beijing admits to having experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
Last year, however, the office reportedly moved from an “emergency situation in the course of work to a rediscovered normality”.
Thus, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings would have decreased by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 such cases have reportedly been closed, representing a 75% increase over the previous year.
However, 81,500 cases remain outstanding at the Office.
Acting is Expensive
As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the office, this is a record and it means that China is for the tenth time in a row in the ranking for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also apply to the total number of legal trademarks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the Office reportedly recorded 1.8 billion yuan of registration fee.
In other words, each record earned an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, as illustrated by the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has been battling a Chinese plagiarist.
Of course, the Germans were able to get the illegal manufacture of vehicle components suspended.
However, the imitator was able to maintain its Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
“It’s our fault, because surnames cannot be protected in Germany,” says Hanno Wentzler, CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Trademark Office had therefore rejected the Munichers' objection.
Freudenberg certainly won the case in the next two instances, but the opposing side continues to fight to this day.
Vigilance is required
The case is currently pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, believes in a positive outcome of the trial and praises the professionalism of the judges.
Nevertheless, he adds: “the procedure is long, tedious and costs us a lot of time and money.”
It is also difficult to estimate internal costs, and the archives department even had to review the actions of the past 100 years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg even vainly proposed to the opposing party a “large six-figure euro sum” to settle the dispute.
“That’s what it means to us,” Wentzler says.
The dangers of the Far East even threaten to overflow to Europe.
This would be the case if imitators in this region ensured the exploitation of unprotected marks.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer wanted to file the name Freudenberg in Germany for a shoe and leather production company.
The company had long since abandoned this sector, but it was still able to prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "vigilance is necessary."
Pattloch and he advised German companies to exercise great caution in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, they say, to rely on international trademark law, foreigners should instead “register everything that is likely to be protected in China as well,” as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, the costs may be much higher than those of registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the last act of his legal drama, the company would have to pay license fees to the opposing party for the use of its own name, as Wentzler explains.
Otherwise, we would lose our place in the market segment in question.
World AIDS Day: kicking, singing, helping
The Imbongi choir repeats in Heidelberg, and the AIDS orphans of Swaziland rejoice in their coming.
Here is the story of a link that crosses much more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First, we hit the foot: cowboy boots, sneakers, shoes for ladies and moccasins for men look for the rhythm by hitting the ground of the foot. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then the vocals of the singers slowly amplify - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - they excite, bewitch and follow each other.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost loses his canvas shoes when he conducts the orchestra with his wildly flexible gestures.
It is Monday night, the Imbongi choir repeats a new song in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg.
Fifty singers aged 23 to 69 came, from human medicine geneticist to home man.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, every choruser has different words, all in a very exotic language: Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Being Helped to Help Each Other
UNAIDS, the United Nations’ AIDS programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are affected by the disease.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 people infected.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV-positive.
180 AIDS orphans from the village of Esitjeni have found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa".
Seventy of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros less, you can become a godfather.
This amount guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal at the gogo center.
Imbongi means in Zulu "storyteller" or "praise-singer".
No one can speak the Bantu language fluently in this region, but everyone can sing it.
For almost 10 years, the choir has been repeating songs in this foreign language that she has brought to Germany to now return it to her native region: South Africa.
At 8,733 kilometres from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
40% of people affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some living in modest straw or earthen huts and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans because HIV has taken their parents away.
In Esitjeni, the ailments in Swaziland are seen on a smaller scale: the highest rate of HIV infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
The population almost never accepts male circumcision, a measure that nevertheless guarantees a proven reduction in the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of the population of Swaziland carries the immunodeficiency virus and it is not uncommon to die in your mid-30s.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir was able to discover the village, especially the Imbongis saw many children in the street who lacked not only parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country without a school diploma, there is simply no prospect.
At first, it was only a few people who personally pledged to pay a few euros each year so that they could send a child to school and offer him a hot meal a day.
But barely a year later, the choir founded "Voices for Africa", an association that has since dealt almost professionally with AIDS orphans in Estjeni.
Facts about Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia, and blennorrhagia (or gonorrhea).
Common STIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
Pubic lice and scabies belong to parasitic STIs.
Which groups are mainly concerned?
Syphilis and blennorrhagia often appear in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that sexual contact between men causes at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia-related infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungal), blenorrhagia, and human papillomavirus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of HIV spread among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany, however, some 20% of new HIV infections are observed within this group.
In young people, the rate of chlamydia-related infections was significantly higher than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections are among young people aged 15 to 25.
In addition, in Germany, the human papilloma virus is common among young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of cases of syphilis has more than doubled in 10 years: from 1.967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has been decreasing.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one-tenth from the previous year.
What Are the Symptoms of Sexual Illness?
Infectious diseases can cause abscesses in the genitals, urinary pain, white discharge, lower abdomen pain as well as the appearance of pimples and warts.
However, they do not regularly cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect yourself?
Condoms can decrease the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason for this is that the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through lubricating infection or close body contacts.
Experts therefore recommend that anyone who frequently changes sexual partners take regular exams.
Most quickly detected STIs can be cured and late sequelae can be avoided.
Thanks to sponsorships, donations, but above all to the funds that the choirs raise thanks to their voices throughout Germany, the means are accumulating.
“In all, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni,” said Annette Lennartz, the association’s president.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman who always gets what she wants, manages money from Germany.
She also ensures that the orphans are well accommodated, for example in one of their grandmothers.
The gogos, as the old Zulu women are called, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them accommodate up to 14 orphans, provide them with a roof and ensure that they go to school every day in their uniforms.
The orphan who has no one else is welcomed in a safe place, at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as are the two cooks who prepare meals every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two henhouses. With the help of the American health organization PSI, the association organized an HIV test for many inhabitants.
This is not obvious, because even though the disease is clearly visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A King and His Fourteen Wives
“AIDS is a real taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it’s a topic that touches on sexuality.”
It's quite curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These state-sanctioned customs, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.
Yet condoms are found on every corner, adds Annette Lennartz, "but almost no one uses them.
Culture is different, flesh for flesh.”
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choristers travel together every two or three years to South Africa and sing songs full of nostalgia, courage, trust and black identity that many people from the tip of the black continent still know during the time of apartheid.
The bus filled with whites singing in the African language is a sign of recognition such that it not only generates good mood and joy, but sometimes also tears a few fearsome border guards.
The bus still takes them to Esitjeni, where the choristers visit their pianists.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni Valley.
"Go to Esijeni, you will find light there," say the people there.
And after an 8,733-kilometre bird trip back to Heidelberg, in front of these choruses who are kicking their feet in the Bergheimer Straße rehearsal room, we also find the light.
Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has reported evidence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet could be up to 20 meters thick.
The US space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is the closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published Thursday in the specialized journal "Science".
The Messenger probe has reported evidence of an ice cover in the region of the planet permanently plunged into the shadows.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters up to 20 meters.
The water probably comes from comets or possibly asteroids that would have hit Mercury.
However, no one makes a connection between the discovery of water and the hypothesis of a presence of life on the planet, explains the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help to understand how water and other life-saving elements arrived in other regions of the solar system.
Unseen by the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, like small interstices through which one observes infinity.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet," according to the new definition of the term from the International Astronomical Union in 2006.
This detail from an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a “family portrait” of the countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and the pink dots, more difficult to identify, are the “newborns” in the delivery room of the universe.
The Spitzer telescope has discovered this region where stars are born, called "W5", a very unromantic name, in the constellation of Cassiopeia, 6,500 light-years away.
NASA's Spitzer Telescope has photographed the flamboyant glow of a dying star.
The donut-shaped circle is made up of elements that the star projects when it dies.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope has photographed this galactic delivery room.
The Pleiades, star clusters also known as "the seven sisters", can be observed with the naked eye at night.
However, the telescope puts more emphasis on colors.
In this infrared photo, the Helix Nebula, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is 700 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius.
Its resemblance to a terrestrial continent earned it the title of North America.
The combination of normal and infrared photography makes it possible to observe a spectacular hue.
Only the Spitzer telescope’s infrared detectors were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest puzzles of astronomy is the creation of the rings of Saturn.
One theory is that the rings are the remains of a moon of Saturn that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without a trace.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs ever taken by the Hubble Telescope is that of the Tourbillon Galaxy.
According to the hue, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula in the constellation Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifide comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three trails of dust divide the glowing heart from the birthplace of the stars.
Astronomers have photographed the beginnings of a cosmic carambolage in the constellation of the Serpentary: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies rush towards each other, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble Telescope has observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname "southern fire wheel".
The Hubble Space Telescope photo shows a detail of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
The nebula is 1,400 light-years away and consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than common household dust.
This photo was developed from optical and radiographic images taken by different telescopes.
You can see the circle of black holes 430 million light-years from Earth.
The space telescope has photographed for NASA this group of galaxies called Arp 273.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The celestial cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These star clouds, which are connected by the Rosette Nebula, also permanently create young stars 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this galaxy with light rays and pierced by a small black hole, there is still no dust, there is only gas.
Scientists believe it was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was composed largely of hydrogen.
Our view of the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have continued to grow and thanks to them, it has been possible to see further and further into the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror in this image had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It makes it possible to observe the universe through two mirrors each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, in the Canary Islands, is immense, the mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to save money.
The diameter still reaches about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of the economic construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at the vertical angle.
Its particularity is due to its large capacity for collecting light.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is close to those of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists are listening to the universe for extraterrestrial signals using the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico).
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Anyone who owns a computer can help with the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) by leveraging the computing power of their machine.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO), in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope, an installation worthy of its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the average infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror is expected to reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will consist of almost 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the telescope will not be able to take pictures until 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, Keck's two telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They wore two mirrors with a diameter of 10 meters each.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observatory, which observes the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A gigantic new telescope should also be built on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration allows us to admire it.
However, the most important images of space come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has given us images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that it had found 1,235 planets candidate since the mission began.
This photo illustrates the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space at the earliest in 2018 on an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
The mission of the telescope will be to find light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that Mercury’s South Pole is also home to ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, as Messenger orbits much closer to the North Pole of Mercury.
Radar data has been showing the presence of ice on Mercury for decades.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now certain.
Drink butter daily, and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country, in which one is still relatively young at 97.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country, in which one is still relatively young at 97.
The trip to the Talysh Mountains is a romantic one.
At the turn of the many turns of the road, the small bus crashes along wooded hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, almost like in the Black Forest.
But here we are in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group named Talysh lives, about which little is known except that they speak Persian and Azeri perfectly and have very longevity.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small town plasteres with its overly aggressive architecture from the Soviet era that does not accord at all with the picturesque mountain scenery.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is far too difficult.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometers, because the road has only one path.
The province has yet to take advantage of the legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, 48-year-old Pilata Fatulayeva is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist spot.
“Bakou became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision Song Contest, and next year there will be the oldest people’s festival in the world here,” says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, the only museum of its kind in the world.
There you can discover the life of about eight dozen Talysh of the region that are over 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he has reached the age of 120.
Having a child at 136
But the museum’s controversial star is irali Müslümov, a 168-year-old shepherd.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And when one thinks that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, Müslümov’s age seems more than doubtful.
“He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973,” Fatulayeva said.
The man would have married three times and he would have had 23 children. At the age of 136, he would still have conceived a daughter.
Would it have been a mistake of a few decades to calculate his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard from him about the elderly man from Central Asia.
“Surprisingly elderly people also live in parts of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” Scholz says, “in Sardinia too, there are men who live incredibly old.”
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence due to the non-existence of the documents, besides the fact that there was no registry of civil status.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
It is nevertheless true that the people of the Lerik area often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
So what is the reason for the longevity in the South of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azerbaijani tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have particular genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, thinks it is a matter of food.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that Talysh high-calorie meals, which love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of which drink a glass of melted butter daily, are good for health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves people’s youth? In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see throughout the Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor next to a deck, beating the contents tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and one daughter, who have long been adults.
Two small children also walk in the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests served in typical armadus glasses in the shape of the belly.
Mirzayeva’s white teeth are perfectly aligned, and beneath her scarf lie long braids of a dark blonde that her son proudly reveals to us.
I’ve always washed my hair with milk, and that’s how I never lost them and they kept their color.
“I’ve never used shampoo,” adds Mirzayeva.
Monthly Retirement is Enough to Live
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In my entire life, I have never bought a single food item in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after the Second World War.
But everything improved when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took over.
The language of propaganda astonishes in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the cult of the father figure of the nation, a man who nevertheless ruled his country as a dictator, knows almost no limits in Azerbaijan
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham succeeded him.
In any case, the elderly in Azerbaijan do not experience distress.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manats (about the same amount as euros) monthly for her retirement, an amount that guarantees a good lifestyle in the region.
And perhaps Mirzayeva’s long-grown son is right: “the elders enjoy great respect in our culture.”
They are the center of the big family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
This is a good reason to live as long as possible.
The "rights of man" omitted in the Constitution
The revolution was revived in Cairo.
Rival demonstrations reveal the deep fracture of the country.
The draft constitution based on Sharia law is fiercely controversial.
The Egyptian president is not greedy for words full of emotion.
We need to make the transition.
"And this achievement is my responsibility to the people and to God," he told state television.
His speech was addressed to the entire people, but also especially to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secularists.
Because all members of the confused and desperately disunited opposition are afraid.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile at the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost apologizing, that he had temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his "in order to save the revolution".
However, the Egyptians and the world don’t really know what this 61-year-old engineer with a PhD from the American University of Southern California wants to save.
Will the judiciary be overthrown?
The 234 articles hurriedly drafted by the predominantly Islamic constituent assembly of 100 people during a fifteen-hour night-time tour of force are indeed worrying to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that the jurisprudence is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word “principles” really mean?
It was and still is a matter of interpretation, and there is good reason to fear that Islamists will use the vague wording and the resulting legal room to apply a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
In any case, it is suggested by a newly-introduced article stating that, with regard to all subjects related to Sharia law, al-Azhar University should be consulted. The institution is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its radiance shines on the entire Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but it does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative apparatus, which would result in the de facto entrustment of the judiciary.
Many points of the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation.
Another problematic aspect is the likely maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's reign, these courts worked to repress opponents.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were held by the military.
The government must also protect “the true nature of the Egyptian family” and “promote its morality and values.”
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that state institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
In other words, it would simply be censorship.
Moreover, no article expressly guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article prohibits offending or defaming the Prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
However, the article does not define what an offense is or how it should be punished.
Equally dubious is the wording suggesting that it is forbidden to "offend people".
Is it enough to draw a caricature of the president or to tell a joke to the detriment of a lawman?
Many points are therefore to be interpreted in the draft that Morsi puts to the vote and which, in his own words, will be "very soon" the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians.
"The Revolution Reborn"
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the numerical superiority of Islamists.
On Friday evening, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual chord in Cairo’s Tahrir Square, vowing to bring down the Sharia law before it takes effect.
“The revolution is reborn and we will win,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, who was third in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei said the draft Constitution is “to be thrown into the trash cans of history.”
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi’s supporters of wanting to foment a “putsch against democracy.”
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said opposition leader Jasser Said.
“We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet expiated,” said Khaled Ali, a politician and opposition member.
In addition, several judges have announced that they do not want to monitor the referendum, which would result in its nullity.
“The Qur’an is our Constitution.”
For its part, the well-organized Muslim brotherhood called for a counter-demonstration not in Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other bank of the Nile, where a large prayer was held in front of Cairo University.
The veiled women and supporters of the Salafists, who participated in it in large numbers, chanted: "the people demand the application of the law of God."
"Clean our country!" they asked Morsi, claiming that "the Qur'an was their Constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tharir Square, where everything began, would soon have engendered a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, this is what Morsi’s supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that opponents of the draft Constitution, like its supporters, had spoken loud and clear.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide by the ballot box the direction the country must take.
The Islamist project will certainly win the majority.
“Human rights are not mentioned once.”
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this imposed constitutional process that should have lasted until February and encompassed all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood while in prison or in court under Mubarak.
He did so not because he shared their view of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
That is why he was beaten, tried and imprisoned.
"And now the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution," he regrets during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are blatant violations of the rules of democracy and will engender a new dictatorship in Egypt.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, the president de facto takes away all his powers,” Saeda said.
Yet a democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels neglected, including by the international community, who looks at the battle between different political ideologies on the Nile’s edge with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
That could be paid.
A protester on Tharir Square warns: "You give birth to a monster that you will no longer be able to control."
Norway's rakfisk: is it the most odorous fish in the world?
The five million people who inhabit Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret to the success of the country be linked to the appetite of the locals for an extremely odorous fish?
Get some advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty football clothes.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway’s most popular dishes.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours from Oslo.
It snows, the landscape is spectacular - and this smell, ubiquitous, soaks the air.
Rakfisk consists of trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in water for a time - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - which can go up to a year.
When the darkness settles and it is cold, Norwegians gather en masse to attend a festival that takes place here in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary specialty.
“You eat raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit,” says Havard Halvarsen, a full-time local firefighter who is also called “Rakfisk General,” who is responsible for managing the festival.
Around us, people swallow small pieces of fish and put on a large amount of drink.
“Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk,” Havard adds.
Drinking kills the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If you can avoid getting it under your nose, it's not bad - it reminds you of a sushi that would have spent long hours on a bus.
Rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, fish was immersed in airtight water barrels, then salted in the fall.
Then, during the winter, once well fermented, the fish came out and - without a doubt with the senses diminished by alcohol - ate.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, emigrating mainly to the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high salaries and a comprehensive health system.
The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was not so long ago richer than Norway, cross the border to come to work.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important, a vital, albeit odorous, element of Norway's past.
This is one of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you 10 € each.
Norway does not often talk about it in international news, which is not to displease it.
Here, people are unwilling to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing extremist racist who shot and killed 77 people, including women and children.
When they talk about this killing, they are talking about the "July 22 incident".
The Norwegians find it difficult to accept that in their peaceful country, one of their own could have committed such an act of barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway has owed its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the largest in the world.
“But oil is not the only reason for our success,” explains Anna, our waitress, with blond hair and piercing blue eyes, the image of Nordic well-being, with a rakfisk tray in her hand.
We are – as you say – cautious people.
His English, like that of most of the people who live here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we don’t like to be noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - everything, except a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries threw the money out the windows, in the years that led us to the international financial crisis, Norway managed to keep the strings of its stock market tight.
“As long as you can ski in winter and hike in summer, we’re happy,” says Anna.
"Not to forget the rakfisk," she adds in a carefree laugh.
I stand in the snow and queue to buy myself something to eat - I got my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a hamburger composed of momentum, a real discovery, it is excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel in which I stay is one of the many places where rakfisk is served for dinner and where one can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the most odorous of them.
There is a TV show where the presenter wears a butterfly knot, surrounded by rakfisk plates.
It looks like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score did you give to the best fish, in the Thor-Juergen mountains?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit.
Or maybe it's because of the fish fumes.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto has a difficult start.
As incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, Will Grant of the BBC is interested in the difficulties ahead and the expectations of the people, which are numerous.
Road traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city where traffic jams are normal, a safety barrage has been in place since Monday, blocking several key road accesses in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
Nevertheless, the objective was not to prevent people from going to their work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, Mexico’s new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarf to become the nation’s new president.
A complicated task awaits him.
Mexico’s economy is doing well, thanks to outgoing president Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already claimed the lives of about 60,000 people in six years.
“My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,” Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before joining the U.S. president, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the state of Mexico.
A very populated and sprawling state that encloses the capital. On its favorite land, opinions about this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the bucolic municipality of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of everyone.
The locals attribute to it the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new highways of M Pena Nieto, a significant improvement has been made to these roads, once bumpy and full of crevasses.
Plates bearing its name are hung outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
“We are counting on him to bring about lasting change,” said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of Congress and the party of Mr Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and the economy in particular, we hope for a real change that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects criticism from opponents who accuse the new president of lacking charisma.
He is an entire man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He is an excellent statesman and, above all, he knows how to listen.
However, this is not always the image that people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more egregious.
Hidden beneath the highways, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called to the rescue to fight neighborhood drug gangs, and violence against women is particularly serious.
In a disaster area, the bodies of dozens of women murdered in the past two years have been found on the verge of landfilling.
More than 1,000 women were killed in Mexico while Pena Nieto was governor, a far higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez – a place infamous for the number of innocent women killed there.
Critics of Mr. Pena Nieto, say that at best, he failed to stem the problem of murders against women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to see reality in the face.
In a concrete house, typical of this dilapidated neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold back her tears when she shows me pictures of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version mentions a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
“When I arrived at her house, it seemed to me that her body had been washed,” says Señora Buendia.
Signs indicated that it had been beaten, and the corpse stiffness had already begun.
While her mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana dresses up the wall, next to a cross with the word: Justice.
However, this is exactly what the family was refused.
The authorities treated me as if I were an old gossip, a troublemaker, a mourner.
They want us to accept what they say and shut up.
“But it’s not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions,” she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives her scarf on Saturday, she will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has pledged to make it his priority during his tenure.
"I hope he will be as good as he was when he was governor," said Olvera in Valle del Bravo, a congressman.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, prosecutors say.
Prosecutors are trying to counter claims of abuse that Bradley Manning allegedly suffered during the detention.
The trial involves Manning’s detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants to close the case on the grounds that Manning's kidnapping took place under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to prove on Friday that Private Bradley Manning -- accused of being behind the largest leak of confidential information in U.S. military history -- has missed many occasions to complain about the ill-treatment he claims to have suffered during his military detention.
During a cross-examination with Manning during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Attorney Maj. Ashden Fein said that recordings of weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine-month detention in Quantico, Virginia, revealed no complaints about his treatment.
The cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defence filed a motion requiring Manning's dismissal on the grounds that the seizure was under very difficult conditions and was sufficiently severe punishment -- occurred one day after Manning testified to his desire to commit suicide during his detention.
The military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was their source.
During Friday’s hearing, Fein examined with Manning the forms that the officers had completed after their meeting with Manning, during his detention in Quantico military prison, where he was subjected to maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein recalled the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment his guards gave him was “excellent” and that the treatment he had received in the prison was overall “very professional.”
The forms did not report any complaints of ill-treatment, although officers directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had orally expressed concerns about some issues and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would address them, but they did not record the issues raised.
"They wrote 'no problem' (after addressing the concerns), and yet it didn't mean I didn't raise any problems," Manning said.
Military Justice Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment in a January 2011 interview with the special commission that had met to discuss the suicide thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning responded that his intention during the meeting was to have his restrictive status changed indicating a “risk of injury.”
The military said they had assigned him this restrictive status -- a level below close surveillance for risk of suicide -- for his own protection and the safety of others.
“I wanted the staff to know that I was doing well, and I wanted to be removed from that status... so I could have a better quality of life from my point of view,” Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at Marine Corps Base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he considered committing suicide when he was in Kuwait and fainted once because of the heat.
He added that not being kept abreast of what was going to happen to him or what was going on in the rest of the world was very distressing.
“My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to this cage,” Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Once at Quantico, Manning said he had spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only items he had were a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothes and his glasses.
He tried to stay in motion, because sleeping or lying down during the day was against the regulations.
Manning also said that when he was trying to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards could not see his face when he turned at night, they would wake him up so they could see his face.
Manning’s lawyer filed a formal complaint for Manning’s treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also on Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation reported in his testimony Thursday -- that after being forced to sleep naked all night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other detainees one morning during the appeal.
Manning testified that at no time was he allowed to cover himself with a blanket during the call.
During the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said he had deduced from his guard's order that he had to drop his blanket that could have concealed his nudity, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before, as he allegedly tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning reportedly told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his underpants or flip-flops to injure himself, but that he had not.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, flip-flops, and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account his experiences during his detention and that he will significantly reduce his sentence if he is convicted before a court martial, a trial that is expected to take place early next year.
The defense said Manning plans to plead guilty to the least serious crimes and fight for the abandonment of other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend, with prosecutors arguing that conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has confirmed that Manning has been incarcerated in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees in Quantico.
Charges against Manning include theft of public goods or documents, collusion with the enemy, resulting in the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of national defense information.
If all charges are brought, he will be sentenced to life in prison.
The Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says many were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind Mexicans of difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says that the Mexican-Americans find themselves caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, arriving in the lobby, in front of the customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Signs indicated two ways: one for the "Mexicans" ("Mexicans"), another for the "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood still for several seconds, not knowing which queue to turn to.
I grew up in central California, where I've been called the "Mexican" my whole life.
This is an ethnic qualifier, just like the one my friends in Boston use when they call themselves "Irish," or my friends in New York when they call themselves "Italians."
Then I became a Mexican-American.
But here it was Mexico.
And on the earth where my grandfather was born, there is no need for a special qualification or a bond of union.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to handle an interview in either language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of an aboriginal, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and headed to the "Foreigners" queue.
I thought about that time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their favorite themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons Mexicans stay in Mexico rather than risking it in the United States.
He wants to ally with the United States and Canada, and create a Union for Trade modelled on the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, although he has not provided further details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give up half of their territory in writing at the tip of the rifle.
But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and not minutes, memories are everywhere.
So as soon as a U.S. official makes any criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how Americans undermine their neighbor's sovereignty.
And the children of Montezuma are looking for a fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is the one that the country has with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans who live in the United States.
Do you want to talk about bitterness?
There's a lot of them.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not.
The only reason that explains the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point in our family tree, a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And more often than not, this person matched a typical profile -- dark, uneducated skin coming from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we're living the American dream right now, we've gone to good schools and we've got good situations, we should never lose sight of the fact that it's the American dream we're living, not the Mexican dream.
Our identity is sometimes disturbed, but our loyalty is obvious.
We grant it to the United States.
Moreover, we know that a part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not like us.
The feeling is reciprocal.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they cough us up as if we were individuals of inferior strain and not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn’t failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we wouldn’t find ourselves stuck on the right side of the fence, living comfortably in the United States, but like lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are frictions between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, because Mexicans claim their identity more firmly and Mexican-Americans are upset.
Although she is a U.S. citizen, she feels like she is part of two countries.
Besides, many Mexican-Americans I know don’t feel like they’re part of one country or the other.
We love the music of the Mexican band, Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we are considered Americans.
In the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And now, to further complicate the relationship, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as fortune ambassadors for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a superb country that must be visited and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
It won't happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And, considering the ubiquitous wage inequalities, corruption and drug-related violence, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to do it yourself, amigos.
That's normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet willing to forgive the United States the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexican Americans still want them the way their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexicans" than I thought.
Old quarrels, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such a hope is in vain.
While the same futile arguments persist for who started, dozens of buildings have been reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza have landed near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while Israelis and Palestinians seem stuck in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in full swing.
The Arab Spring has shattered everything, and whether we like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in this regional upheaval.
Perhaps their struggle will intensify even further.
Yet there is every reason to think that it could help them get out of this deadly deadly deadly impasse.
A war that makes no loser or winner
At first glance, it seems difficult to be optimistic.
While the November 21 ceasefire continues, this week’s fighting has strengthened supporters of the force on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will boast of forcing the Israelis to give up, even though Gaza has suffered a landslide.
Having killed some of its leaders and driven the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza into one of the most miserable and overcrowded corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their Fatah rivals, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders might say that time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is growing stronger, and Hamas has made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a burgeoning regional power, once Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has taken a stand for Hamas; as has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Hamas members jubilate and say the Islamist crescent bends around Israel, from Lebanon in the north, where the Hezbollah militia exercises its dominance, through Syria, where Islamist rebels can overthrow Bashar El Assad, and to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And most importantly, on Israel’s southern flank, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and central Arab country, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas, and their leaders rely more easily on public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important player that can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, supporters of Israel’s hard line will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas has been put back in the box.
The missile interception system dubbed Iron Dome has proven its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
Israelis will be able to sleep on both ears – for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America is renewing its unwavering support; and many European countries have blamed Hamas for being behind the latest wave of violence.
But most importantly, Israel prospered, notably under Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who totally ignored the peace process.
Although the Gaza rocket fire has killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared the suicide bombings, notably thanks to the separation barrier that encroaches on the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and that protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illegality in international law.
Mr Netanyahu, whose Likud party has merged with an even more warlike party, that of leader Avigdor Lieberman as the 22 January election approaches, has the good side.
Why pamper these damned Palestinians by giving them a state?
If they ruled the West Bank, would they not launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is best to keep them behind that wall and hit them as soon as they come out the head.
Maybe the hardliners will win; but the Arab Spring may change the game.
Even if the Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere appreciate little of Israel, their priority will be to tackle problems in their own countries.
Israel’s defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to fix their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a ceasefire, which is a good omen -- and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder keg that is bound to one day explode in the Israeli-occupied territories – much like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics exacerbate this problem as the Arab population grows.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to ring Hamas will have a diplomatic price.
Both sides need to be pushed by those from the outside.
The answer remains that advocated by reasonable people on each side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a cession of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
One hope, small and short-term, is that the ceasefire will give outsiders an opportunity to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now work to end the flow of arms to Gaza, like Turkey and Qatar, is better positioned than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with exchanges of land and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside countries should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming proposal of a pseudo-state at the United Nations.
Mr. Obama also has an interest in Israel agreeing to negotiate.
During his first term, he did not present his own peace plan.
Back in the White House, he seems equally reluctant to establish one.
It is a very narrow vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This is through a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Laws for neutral cigarette packs came into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of diseased organs cover dark green packets that are all the same, regardless of brand
This law came into force in Australia is a world first, logos and colors have been replaced by a dark olive green and horrible pictures of sick organs and depictions of children and babies whose diseases were caused by smoking their parents.
Apart from the different photos and sanitary warnings, the only difference between the packages, since this Saturday, is the brand name, printed in small print on all packages.
This is the strictest tobacco packaging regime in the world.
The Australian federal government said the goal was to deter young people from smoking by removing any glamorous representation.
Studies have shown that if people didn’t start smoking before the age of 26, there’s a 99% chance they’ll never start.
“Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image,” Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek said, citing studies that revealed, for example, that children associated the crown of a logo with a princess.
Although Australia has the lowest smoking rate in the world and these changes have little impact on multinational profits, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has been lobbying against this law.
Tobacco manufacturers said it would revive the black market trade, which will give easier access to cheaper cigarettes.
“Dangerous consequences will follow from this legislation,” said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Forgeries in China and Indonesia will sell far more counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others said that this law had boosted their activity.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said the demand for cigarette cases, including silicone to mask horrific packaging, has risen sharply two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost to Australia's high court.
He said Zico has sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is awaiting stock renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only annoyance, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the segment of the population targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banning TV ads, sports sponsorship and the obligation for retailers to hide cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned web advertising by businesses and local sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so.
“If you work in tobacco marketing and you only have a small showcase to promote your products, the Internet is the place to be,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman has noticed an increase in contributions from some lambda citizens in favor of brands on social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We have to ask ourselves if it is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and who has bothered to make a video, or if it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry is focusing on the new regulations in place rather than marketing.
Industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new court rulings – these countries have told WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries has had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected to be taken in the course of 2013.
Plibersek said the government had held discussions with other countries regarding similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make warning pictures mandatory on packaging in 2001.
At present, these warnings are present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Stricter laws are currently being studied in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The photos don't bother me.
I ignore them.
“You take a cigarette and you pack,” Victor El Hage said when buying a package with a picture of a tumor in his mouth.
To be honest, the only reason I'm gonna get arrested is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack Tobacconist" in central Sydney, said uniform packaging made it difficult to store packages on shelves.
"Before, it took me an hour to unload a package, now, it takes me four hours," Yu said.
"The government only had to ban them once and for all and we would have said OK, okay, stop and put the key under the door," he added, raising his arms to the sky.
In a constantly connected world, it can be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during the Thanksgiving period because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had enough time to think about the issue of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight is boring enough, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not to mention duty-free shops).
But more and more, some academics and experts specializing in child development praise the boredom.
It’s perfectly normal for us – and our kids – to get bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to take interesting paths, even nurturing creativity.
And since we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Yeah.
No, I don't.
But I'll come back.
First of all, like many people, I thought boredom was a fairly recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greco-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
“The boredom goes back a long way,” he says.
On the walls of Pompeii are Latin graffiti that evoke boredom, they go back to the first century.
Then there is the definition we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined, and debated, in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After going through numerous publications and submitting the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experiment that consists of “wanting to do something but failing to get into a satisfying activity.”
What differentiates boredom from apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task even though they would like it.
With apathy, he says, there is no desire to do anything.
What is at the heart of the boredom, he said, is “the interruption of the attention process, associated with a bad mood and the feeling that time passes slowly.”
Boredom can strongly resemble depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while the two can be linked, people who get bored tend to think the problem comes from the environment or the world, while depressed people think the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we think that we are bored when it is actually a problem of concentration.
As part of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," which was published in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an older experience in which participants listened to tape, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard, from the next room, the too high sound of a TV show that had no connection, others just heard the TV show, and the third group did not hear the soundtrack at all.
Those who heard TV at a low noise level said they were more bored than the other two groups - they struggled to focus, but didn't know why, and attributed this problem of concentration to boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult or challenging task, an interruption of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study’s authors.
On the other hand, when you perform a boring task, “like looking at objects on an assembly line, music can help you not get bored.”
In fact, he says, now we know that when you twist or scratch, these gestures, often seen as signs of boredom, are actually a good way to stay physically alert.
“Studies have shown that children who are allowed to giggle learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stay motionless,” Fenske said.
We all get bored one day or the other - the delay of my flight, a speaker with a monochord voice, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a "Scale of Predisposition to Boredom" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements such as, “Among the tasks I do, many of them are repetitive and monotonous,” and “I have so many interests that I don’t have time to do everything.”
Using such a scale, the researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a psychology professor at the University of West Florida, and especially need numerous and varied stimulations.
But in general, teenagers are quickly blasé.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of individual and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He found that 32 percent of teens reported being bored at school and during homework, while 23 percent reported being bored when they were not at school.
In contrast, 3% of parents reported being bored.
Professor Larson said he didn’t know whether today’s boredom percentages, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that “adolescence is a time when boredom reaches its highest level,” especially because children and teens don’t have much control over what they want to do.
If I ask my question: is boredom right for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can cause people to take absurd physical risks, make bets or abuse certain substances to pass the time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers evoke a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
“Annoyance is the way the brain has found to let you know you should do something else,” said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at the N.Y.U.
But the brain doesn’t always know what is the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won’t get bored anymore, but he won’t have learned to take care of himself or self, says Professor Fenske.
And “this self-regulation moves from one situation to another,” he says.
Your child doesn’t just learn to have fun, he gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify boredom.
Just as I don't think we should criticize him either.
Feeling comfortable outside the constant bubbling that activities and technology generate is the goal we should aim for.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
“We need to get bored more often, but boredom awakens an acute and frantic desire to be connected to something that makes sense,” he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and appreciate downtime.
“In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated,” he added, “it’s hard to find ways to get into something when the noise stops.”
In Colorado, no directives for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19, a college student and soccer player in Colorado, is charged with something that will soon become legal in his state: possession of marijuana pellets and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said that one day in September, he and a few friends were in a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a subpoena for possession of drugs and equipment that could be used for his use - minor offenses, each accompanied by a $100 fine - and a date of appearance.
“We are treated like criminals,” Orozco said.
But is there one?
During the weeks of uncertainty following Colorado’s vote to legalize the use of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on the place than the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving marijuana use have been dismissed without consequence.
Police have stopped charging adults 21 and older for minor possession of marijuana, as the law will come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado’s more conservative ridings have called for speeding up existing marijuana cases and continue to indict people who own it.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains are currently voting to prevent the opening of state-approved marijuana stores in their neighborhoods.
“Things are changing so fast that I don’t know what the future holds,” said Daniel J. Oates, Aurora Police Chief, east of Denver.
Washington state regulators are also asking a lot of questions.
They are seeking guidance on how to install a permit system, authorizing to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the December 1, 2013 deadline.
They say that Colorado, whether we like it or not, is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana, first of all in terms of therapeutic use and now in terms of personal use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, and it’s a good indicator,” said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, Smith admits, can do more than suggest what works.
“There is no real precedent on which we could base ourselves,” he said.
The Washington law, which is called I-502, takes effect on December 6, leaving a year-long legal vacuum during which the permit system will still not exist, while marijuana possession will be legal.
Meanwhile, practical questions remain: how to balance the state’s mandate that ensures proper access to licensed marijuana and prohibits the installation of cannabis outlets within a 30-km radius around a school, park, playground or crèche.
“There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to set up an approved cannabis sales business, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the newly formed Cannabis Legalization Center.
On November 21, the chief of police, Oates, in Aurora, sent an email to his officers announcing that the “City Attorney” would no longer prosecute people 21 and older who possess small amounts of marijuana, and that the police should stop charging people for this type of offense “with immediate effect.”
Chief Oates said police would enforce new court rulings that regulate the activity of those who grow marijuana for medical purposes, and that he would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, the district attorney, Ken Buck, embodies a stricter vision.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to handle marijuana possession cases, primarily to pressure users to get detoxified.
Currently, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are subject to other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to prosecute those people who committed a crime that, at the time of the acts, was a recognized offence," Buck said.
Reactions have been complicated even in rural areas such as Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative in favor of restricted marijuana use.
Police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, no longer show adults for possession of limited quantities.
County Attorney General Pete Hautzinger supported the decision, but also decided not to file all marijuana detention cases.
“I don’t feel like I’m wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes,” he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, providing a legal and governmental framework appropriate to personal marijuana use is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in different U.S. cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana.
“This is a cultural barrier” with prosecutors, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents people accused of marijuana use and who speaks as a local spokesperson for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
“They’ve spent a good part of their lives suing people who used marijuana, so do they find it hard to accept that it’s legal,” he said.
As the first states to treat restricted marijuana use at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and the state of Washington are on track to become a case law for drug legalization.
While advocates and state officials are planning a new legalized sales frontier, they are anxiously awaiting guidelines from the federal government, which still views the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates of marijuana legalization hope the Department of Justice will give in.
Despite some publicized arrests of medical marijuana patients and vendors, the federal government has mostly allowed medical marijuana stores to operate in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
While it’s true that police aren’t likely to push doors to seize small bags of drugs, there’s a strong chance they’re opposed to authorized marijuana stores for personal use authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former policy adviser to the Obama administration.
Many Colorado cities have not waited for federal authorities to act.
Long before the vote, some local governments approved moratoriums on the creation of new marijuana sales outlets, even though this is only a one-year delay.
Last week, the city of Montrose obtained a six-month moratorium, and is expected to impose this ban next week.
“We don’t want to end up in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then we’re faced with a federal problem,” said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community rather than the vote of the state.
Many questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: I was mistreated and excluded from Oxford because I was a Tory.
It’s not just today’s students who are attacked for their opinions.
As far back as I can remember, I always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in what was for me an eminent place of knowledge, a kind of modern-day Greek amphitheater that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
Yet, two weeks after I moved to Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to pack my bags, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started crying.
My friends were confused.
The L'Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I left this university because I objected to the fact that undergraduate students had sex in the room next to mine.
Author A. N. Wilson stated facetiously that I was gone after being forced to drink from broken cups.
The truth was less funny.
I'm gone.
Yes, I fled because I had been bullied and constantly bullied.
Not because of my rather outrageous name, nor because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for only one reason, and in this cradle of so-called knowledge, I was the victim of racist and barbaric behavior: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why talk about it today, you might say.
Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of center-right students are experiencing the same type of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford is such that last week, some of them demanded protection of their rights, as well as those of gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College’s student hall (JCR) said they were “often isolated, personally attacked and felt unwanted” because of their political views.
They want there to be a representative on the University Equal Opportunity Committee so that their views can be expressed freely.
Their situation was not facilitated by the recent BBC Two documentary Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right, devoted to student politics, which portrayed the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
Among them was student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who travels in Rolls-Royce, wears a silver suit and travels with a chrome-headed cane.
In other universities, conservative students say they are treated as scapegoats of setting up higher tuition fees.”
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper "that there is a growing left bias in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi who has proposed a motion for more protection, says such a climate is "uncomfortable," and Stephanie Cherill, 19, president of the OUCA, says there has been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members towards people who are center-right.
“This is a barrier to the freedom of intellectual debate, as well as the well-being of members,” she said.
I was the only one to think that way during my first weeks at Oxford.
I entered in September 1986, when I was 18 years old and paralyzingly shy.
The Conservative Party’s hatred was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted to refuse to grant Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary degree, because of the reduction in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere was charged with Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the host week, when new students got to know each other and the teachers, I had a taste of what was going to happen next.
I discovered that teachers not only participated in the sarcasm of Tory students, but also enjoyed it.
It was as if the policy of miners strikers, privatization and government opposition to apartheid sanctions in South Africa was engraved in the woods of classrooms.
The first sarcasm of which I was a victim concerned an English translation of the French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared for it.
“Miss Wyatt,” said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), “please translate the first paragraph.”
I've lost my foot.
Pitt, a small man with a pustulous face, easily ran away.
"Are Thatcherists refusing to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
Tears burned my eyes.
"I suggest you take French lessons in your spare time - finally, if you're not too busy making friends," he said.
I went back to my room, inconsolable.
At dinner that night, I sat alone and then felt a slight tap on my shoulder.
He was a second-year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
“I know who you are,” he said, gently.
I'm afraid that's the way it is.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is targeted.
It's already hard enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even harder for you.
Most Tory youths claim to be Labour (workers).
Later, at the local pub, I cowardly tried to hide.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Mrs Thatcher said.
This ploy has failed.
A first-year student of philosophy, political science and economics who, ironically, had studied in Eton, said, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students took up the chorus.
I was perverted, dirty.
“How do Tories make love?” asked one of them.
They are hitting each other, aren’t they?”
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the sixties.
Could I have lived a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Should I become Labour and renounce my views?
The next three years were going to look like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who taught at my university.
He was hated not only because he was conservative, but also because he was Thatcher's foreign policy advisor and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as its adherence to the Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a teaching position at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You won’t be happy here,” he said.
I started commuting between Oxford and my parents’ home in London, finding refuge with my family and more open-minded city friends.
I told my dad I hated Oxford and I explained why.
He was incredulous.
During his studies at Oxford, in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
“But it’s the best place in the world,” he said patheticly.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city with the dreamy bell towers.
Even my communist friends had impeccable ways.
He had tears in his eyes.
Give them a chance.
I'm sure it's to tease you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired of my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and renounced his convictions.
During a work session the following week, when another history professor suggested the world’s most serious, that I was “an enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Inwardly red with shame, I admitted to being a victim of my parents’ brainwashing and called them “old fools.”
The respite was short-lived.
It was my father who stuck the last nail in my Oxford coffin.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch’s press each week.
My door was locked.
I stayed clapping in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I've never been back.
You can call me a wet crying chicken.
But no 18-year-old should be the victim of such bullying in a school.
The most tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but also enjoys an unwavering reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of Couture", inaugurated this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian couturier.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The couturier recognized him at the inauguration of "Valentino: un Maître de la Couture", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 haute couture models created for his couture house over the past 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the highlight of a story whose only protagonist is "il Signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, we find an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exposes his personal memories as the trophies of his social rise: from the modest couturier of the northern Italian city of Voghera to the idol of the international jet-set.
There is nothing wrong with loving royalty.
“At least they don’t crush their cigarette butts on your beautiful carpet like some pop stars do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and welcomes with generosity and elegance.
“We all loved being invited to her cottage in Gstaad,” says the ex-wife of “Heini” Thyssen, an intimate friend of past beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentine model, Valeria Mazza, has also not forgotten the couturier’s charisma.
Several years ago, after a parade on the Spanish Steps in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
There were about 20 of us, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We could see and feel his spirit in every detail of his apartment, in the decoration, the food, the music.
"With him, every guest felt important and appreciated," recalls the "top model", who began working with him during the Haute-Couture week in Paris in 1995.
“He will never go out of fashion, because his creations are works of art,” she concludes.
Nobility lineage parade
Garavani’s life is not a story of obsessions but of shared loves.
He loves well-educated people with the greatest titles and they love him too.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous podium of sixty meters wide that offers to exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and has to scroll on the podium to admire a "public" dream carrying the main creations of Valentino, like the tailor that Jackie Kennedy had chosen for his wedding with Aristote Onassis or the costume that No
Among this audience of models are names such as Sybille of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophie of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Couturier in 2006
Many of its customers say that the first Valentino clothes are like the first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember it perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a "gillette" vest and a jacket from the autumn-winter 1971-1972 collection.
“It’s a gift he gave me,” said Naty Abascal, one of the seamstress’s muses.
“I prefer him to everyone else for his femininity, his great love of women, and because he sublimates our beauty,” adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors he uses, they are bright and brighten the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashionista Patricia della Giovampaola of Arenberg cannot forget the first time she wore a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager living in Italy, she dreamed of being the age and the opportunity to wear one of her evening gowns.
Eventually, this was possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edward of Linea.
It was a red evening dress, with a ruffled skirt, a draped bustier and a décolleté to fall off.
“It was a dream come true,” said Rodrigue d’Arenberg’s widow.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with the timeless,” explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess of Arenberg keeps the dresses of the dressmaker with the greatest care, because an evening dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories that it carries.
The "Kings" of Fashion
The grand finale of Somerset House's exhibition is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller worn during her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (the seamstress calls his seamstresses) to make this ivory silk dress with inlays of pearls, twelve different kinds of lace and a trail of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of haute couture of the end of the 20th century, "the return of customers of high society".
Obsessed for years by the "know-how" of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any spouse of its clients.
“His refinement, his calmness, his neat and perfect appearance have always come to my attention,” says d’Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.
"He was impeccable, the years have no effect on him."
If it's a princess who says so...
The hardest job in the world: the human mules by Kawah Ijen
For four euros, carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulfur through the steep stone trails.
There are people for whom work is hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who make their living carrying sulphur from Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It has to work every day to the bottom of the crater, where sulfuric gas emanating from the bowels of the earth solidifies in contact with air.
After collecting large sulfur rocks, which weigh in total about 70 kilos, he installs them in two bamboo baskets that he loads on his shoulders through the steep trails.
There are only 250 meters to the summit of the volcano that peaks at 2,386 meters above sea level, but exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb that distance, at a turtle’s pace, keeping their balance and measuring their steps so as not to stumble and fall into the precipice.
They know that a misstep could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed deadly into Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for each kilo of sulphur extracted.
Once at the top, they make their way among the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus animals, and carrying the heavy baskets, they walk the 3 kilometers until the balance that a mining company has installed a little below 1,850 meters above sea level.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, you could say, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) per kilo of sulphur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry since this ore is very present in everyday life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even used to whiten sugar.
“As we carry about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip,” explains Anto, who usually travels three times a day.
It takes him 3 hours and he finishes exhausted, but this allows him to earn 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is three times what he would gain in the fields.
“Miners’ income is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros),” says the porter who once worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, her salary was 75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) a day and the job was not so difficult, but Anto returned to her family in Banyuwangi, a village close to the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as sulfur: "I married a young girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I converted her to Java."
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At 27, he spent three of his life challenging the danger on the Kawah ljen, but sulfur has already begun to make him pay the bill although he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases released by the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to pursue his dream.
"I'm going to work another two years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
Misled by life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waiter or receptionist in a hotel, but instead he does the job of a mule.
It shares an unsanitary wood mast with other bearers, rises every day at two o'clock in the morning as the sulphur does not cease to sprout at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the middle of darkness.
Defying the darkness, Anto descends into the crater lighting up with a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers load the sulfur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable benefits, the mining company has not mechanized sulphur extraction to save costs and does not provide any equipment to carriers who work on their own and are paid by weight.
In addition, they do not receive a sub of the 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) increase per camera, in addition to the entry of 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros), which the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This work is done for the beasts, not for humans,” protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old corpulent carrier who has been working in Kawah Ijen for thirty years, since he left college.
Able to carry up to 110 kilos, he assures that he will not stop working "as long as he can", because he needs money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18 years.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although sulfur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the miners in the thick columns of smoke that come out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of suffering from serious diseases... to which obviously are added their usual breathing problems, osteoarthritis, pains in the knees and shoulders, deformed by the weights.
By balancing the basket on its back, the 53-year-old Unainik can only load 50 kilos.
Every day, he and his companions extracted 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks transported to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away by a weed-infested goat trail.
“I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life,” Unainik said, opening his mouth, revealing several missing teeth.
The eldest of his five children, aged 30, also works as a sulfur carrier.
Time passes, but perpetual misery from generation to generation is one of the most difficult jobs in the world: the one done by the human mules of Kawah ljen volcano.
Singapore looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame this lack of children for the career, stress and cost of access to property.
“Singapore’s population needs to grow.”
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, let us fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem implausible that these words come from an advertisement for mint pellets, but in spite of this, or perhaps thanks to this, the video spread like a powder trail on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The lyrics come from a rap group that uses local references such as "Let's put a polychinel in the drawer" to mock Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency behind the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way thanks to this advertisement.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill “their national duty.”
It is intended only for the Internet, so we were able to make it entertaining and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of birthing, so we felt that it was a topic that we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried several things like throwing perfumes at pheromones or hosting speed-dating parties.
Many of these ideas were creative but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we said to ourselves, what could be more creative to solve this problem than making it into a rap song?
1.2 children
Singapore’s government doesn’t take it so lightly.
He spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage his citizens to have more children.
A government measure in favor of marriages and fathers grants up to $15,000 per child, lengthens maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this had little effect.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for its leaders’ conservatism and strict social controls.
Singapore ' s birth rate, according to its national population distribution, is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2, considered the renewal rate, was in 1976.
So why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policies at the National Population Division, says it’s due to “better education” and “a wider choice of career opportunities.”
“It has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and family formation,” she says.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of singles and to delay marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counteract population decline has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that abound with barely disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, especially Chinese who are accused of pulling wages down and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore’s ruling party last year had its worst election results since independence.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the introduction of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the drop in the birth rate has known effects on a country’s economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore’s example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to prevent the construction of many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe boxes", that can be built in specific areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers wishing to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, managing director of real estate company EL Developers, says its “shoe boxes” sell much faster than larger housing units.
They are more popular, in the sense that these homes are built much faster than larger ones.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our cash.
However, he admits that the new standards give clearer instructions to developers, who were previously put sticks in the wheels if they wanted to offer too many small housing units in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
If these new regulations can be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, by talking with Singaporeans working in the financial district of the center, it seems that they are not going to have much effect.
“People are very stressed, homes are expensive, and so is education, which is why people postpone it,” says one young executive.
Other people can have children.
“But for me, it’s important to be able to have my money and my time,” another 20-year-old told us.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and the cost of access to property and education as the reasons preventing them from having children.
So, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, it is the Singaporeans themselves who have the final say.
What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy, this is the quality of the private domain or "the domain of private life that we can protect from intrusion".
What is the private domain for children under 16?
How to apply this definition in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to by broadcasting events on the Internet that he would certainly not share offline?
The newspaper elPeriodico interviewed five young boys, aged between 10 and 15, frequent users of the web.
In four of the cases, they associated the term "something very personal" on a personal level and "the password and username" when they applied it to social networks.
“I’m not going to reveal my most personal secrets in a post,” Jorge, 10, says when trying to explain the meaning of the term private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had an account for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother can know them but not everyone," he said.
On FB, I post cool images or games.
I also talk to my friends.
“I’m not going to share one of my photos or someone who would do the stupid thing,” he says.
The boy acknowledges that it is wrong to post obscene photos, naked people, crimes or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge says he knows his 35 friends on FB as well as his nine Twitter followers.
The majority are family.
Her mother is part of it, she knows the password to one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if they answer me, I just post them,” he adds.
“Social media is fun, I can talk to distant relatives or friends quickly,” he says.
He said he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
Nor will he trust someone who would recommend a stranger to him.
The case of José, 14, is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits not to know 20 of the people on his list of friends.
“It doesn’t bother me because we have something in common, like music,” he says.
According to the boy, no one made any advances or asked him for his address or phone number.
“If they put pressure on me or demanded it, I would simply remove them from my account,” he admits.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we know today as cyberbullying are not foreign to the young boy.
A close friend of mine was sacked on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
“He never knew who it was,” he said.
The victim, according to José, did not close his account.
"He only went privately."
He then explains a series of manipulations to configure his account in a secure way.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if I was angry or angry.
“Even though I know it’s cyberbullying,” he says.
Key Issues
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and graduate in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents, we must understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a way to search for information, but with the emergence of these sites, the rule of the game has changed," she said.
Porras reports that academician Marc Prensky, who holds a master’s degree in pedagogy from Yale University and author of the book “Natives and Digital Immigrants,” uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are the ones who are born with technology.
“We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them there, while we are learning ourselves,” she says.
He adds that the theme is complex, "because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what it is appropriate to disclose, publish or say at an age where they do not have the maturity to do so."
“We also ask them to be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” she added.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach privacy to children and adolescents is to use questions that make them think.
“Their saying not to do it is useless,” she says.
Next, Porras lists a few examples: there are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like them to post a picture of you like that of a friend you posted?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you identify party photos, do you ask others for permission to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you’re doing at every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they have to act online as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
“Outside the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, it must be the same on social media,” she said.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary teacher and education advisor, says it is essential that parents read the terms of use of social networks carefully.
By understanding each of the terms, they will have a solid foundation for discussing with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
“For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish,” he says.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children not to talk to strangers.
The UNASUR Summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration being made public, although it was previously announced and theoretically adopted by the seven proxies present.
Efe has repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the VI Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially indicated that it would be leaked after the summit closed, then claimed that it would be published at any time on the Peruvian government website.
When asked about the text, they reported that its content had been exposed by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief statements to the press.
Journalists’ access to information about the summit has been constantly restricted.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, restricted audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The little information that circulated among journalists was that given by press attachés of some of the governments of Unasur who were attending the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document leaked during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some unease among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media outlets who demanded more important information.
Later, Peru’s presidency sent an email to the media with the summit’s “final statement,” but it was President Humala’s speech and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd Summit of South America-Arab Countries (ASPA) and, on that occasion, although it had been requested by the press, it had also not issued the declaration also called the Lima Declaration, as previously announced.
On the ASPA official website, it can be verified that the document was published last March.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to put in place safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they limited the collection of information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment from the Hague Court that cuts a different border between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the regional meeting and said they would respect the ICJ’s decision to hear the pleas of both parties in the trial that Lima filed against Santiago and that begins Monday in The Hague.
“We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes that we bring to this international court today,” said President Humala.
“Chile has always been, and will continue to be, a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of controversies, treaties and international tribunals,” Piñera said in a statement.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ came after Colombia this week denounced the Bogotá Pact by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of that international tribunal, following a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered to be gravely wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the impeachment of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was tasked with opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
He read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action for 31 projects had been established between South American countries for a total of $17 million in investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of Unasur would set up "significant steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship by developing agreements on residence permits".
He informed that actions would be put in place to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions for better access to medicines, low-cost Internet access throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters."
With Europe in crisis, “the economic consolidation (of Latin America) must not have a triumphalist matrix but must help increase our productive matrix and envision a better future for our populations,” concluded President Humala.
“We have decided to prioritize a group of 31 iconic projects that improve the connection of South American spaces, especially in rural and border areas ... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits,” he said in a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five concerned Peru and were located on the transversal axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador although he did not give further details.
Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that this country's electoral process will allow its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and with good relations with its neighbours, is another theme discussed at the summit.
In this regard, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico City to calmly discuss the maritime dispute through a ICJ judgement requested by Bogota.
“It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday) I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega,” Santos said.
“We will review all these routes, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua that will ask for a discussion with this country,” he said.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will deal with this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos said.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City where they plan to attend the seizure of power of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, in the context of the summit, the bloc’s defence ministers will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of UNASUR, although UNASUR is suspended.
Peru holds the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
“South America needs to learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship,” Correa said.
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa said today that the creation of a common citizenship was an objective for which "South America, in this case, should take an example on Europe".
President Correa, who participated in the VI Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), located in Lima, told state TV, TV Peru, that Europeans "were intertwined during World War II" and other conflicts, "but they were now almost a homeland".
In this sense, he defended the project of establishing a South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of Unasur.
“We must achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case for the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to make belong to the past,” he warned.
In addition, the Ecuadorian president has expressed support for the reconstitution of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account the signatories of the San José Pact on human rights.
Those who are beating our ears never compromise anything, on the contrary, we South Americans have all signed it.
“It’s incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under U.S. funding,” he said, referring to Ecuador’s political asylum for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa says he does not regret his decision, because he himself did not betray his principles, but instead respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, “there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected.”
He also criticized the Swedish court, which demanded that he submit to an interrogation on his territory regarding an alleged sexual offence, while “swedish legislation itself allows it to be done by videoconferencing, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London.”
Correa said there was a risk that Assange's mental and physical health could deteriorate.
“I haven’t spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious,” he said.
It is possible that his physical and mental health deteriorates by being locked in a small space without being able to exercise outdoors.
“It affects anyone’s health,” he concludes.
Correa reports that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, which would be the attribution of a safe-conduct that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and he points out that he had discussions in London to find a solution to the wiki’s founding.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
“The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a whole series of proceedings before different European bodies,” he said.
And he thinks that “if Britain were to grant safe-driving as early as tomorrow, it would end.”
And if Sweden, as its legislation fully allows, and as it has already done in other cases, were to question Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, or question him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and he specified that what he did not tolerate was "mediocrity, bad faith and lies that harm freedom of expression".
“The greatest enemies of press freedom are not the evil or perverse politicians but the bad journalists on the payroll of greed, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
From this point of view, he welcomed the fact that he was not such a journalist “neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate in Ecuador” and, rather than highlighting his re-election, “would deepen the revolution to pursue the path and chart the right path.”
Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto on Paraguay within Unasur until at least the next election, arguing that the body “should be firm and not tolerate opportunism and covert coup attempts,” because in reality, it “destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy.”
Moreover, the Ecuadorian president considers as "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of The Hague, which will strengthen the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua.
At the moment, this judgment is not respected.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to move forward together.
We need to solve them as a whole in order to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he said he was confident in the good resolution of the maritime border dispute between Peru and Chile in the same court and said it was "beneficial that Latin America should seize international forums if both countries agree to accept a judgement as firm as it is."
Referring to the possibility of his nomination as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador for a third consecutive term, he pointed out that he saw this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult".
Correa assured that if he lost the February 2013 primaries, he would withdraw from public life.
On a personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as those in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be resolved through political power.
“My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed this possible victory but we must accept this responsibility,” he said.
If I won, it would be my last presidential term and then I would retire from political life.
If we ever lose, I will too.
"It's my decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a relapse in President Chávez's health," he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with a call for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the test result: HIV-positive.
“It’s as if the sky had fallen on my head,” he said, referring to the moment of the announcement, which the doctor had tried to make “less painful,” in vain.
The young man hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness on his own and began to learn about it and his hardship was such that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), in which he found himself in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, where there were many doubts, few treatment choices and more stigmas.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye “because he was speechless.”
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, “exhausted” their immune system and become victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first reported cases, "the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who has started treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same," said the head of the HIV unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and he takes as reference that this scientific information was validated in April of this year in.
Infectiologist and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depended on the level of immune system involvement that patients presented at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those who do not consume drugs.4
To put it simply, it means that for someone who would be diagnosed with HIV-positive at 25, “as long as he remains under control, he will be able to live without problems up to 75 years,” the scientist said.
In order to put this progress back into context, it is important to know that the average life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years.
While mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of AIDS-related deaths has increased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the annual UNAIDS report), but it is also true that, since the onset of AIDS, 60% of patients on the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there have been 187 deaths as of May this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
So why are there still deaths?
I don’t think the problem is with access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
In the last 12 years at least, we have never lacked drugs, the problem is that patients arrive at very advanced stages because they do not know that they are infected, or they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
He gives us an indisputable fact "nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what is needed to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and, for this, we need to offer screening tests in a massive way, to all people who ask for it".
The specialists and members of the State AIDS Prevention Council of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on his proposal, as do the patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who had to do his screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done it and despite his young age, he was already an AIDS carrier and suffered from Kaposi sarcoma.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and don't want to know anything.
“If I’m going to die, I’d better have sex three times a week,” they say.
The change was beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medications.
To date, his parents only know that he has cancer.
I have a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but co-responsible, I pay attention to myself and to the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his privacy with Milenio Jalisco to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the World AIDS Day march.
That they do the test, if they have taken risks, the sooner they will know if they are HIV positive and the better it will be, and if they already have the diagnosis, they need to know that we can live like everyone else, being responsible for it.
His message sums up the slogan of the battle against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms on the counter
There are many gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has embraced the cause of HIV.
And the biggest one is prevention.
In all the places dedicated to this, "we have actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we are given packs of a hundred, it's very good, but it results, that even today, some do not have access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question, "What are you going to do with it?", sarcastically asked by social workers, counselors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that teenagers don't want to hear.
It proposes to redirect this inefficient distribution; that condoms not only be sold at the counters, but also be found in public toilet dispensers and in places frequented by young people.
It is not about encouraging promiscuity.
Nor is it about paying them the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González had replied when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
"This is not how sexuality works, the best thing is to provide condoms to people who are already sexually active," he said.
Numbers in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The State is the 4th state in the number of new and cumulative AIDS cases and 13th in the number of HIV patients.
92% of infections are sexually transmitted, 6% are bloodborne and 2% are perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, since for each recorded case, there are 4 or 5 people who do not know about it.
A U.S. court-approved judgment ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group’s debt through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, setting a detrimental precedent for all domestic companies with branches in the neighboring country and solvency issues.
Therefore, it seems that the procedures for the survival of companies authorized by Mexican laws are not valid in the country with the star flag, contrary to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, Judge Harlin Hale’s June 15 ruling on the Northern Texas Bankruptcy Court leaves Mexican companies defenseless of the possibility of embargoing their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow Mexico’s leading glass maker to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court based on three inconsistencies.
First, while the case judge points out that creditors must register under the U.S. Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal, sitting in New Orleans, claims that the main proceeding is commercial bankruptcy formalized in Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Commercial Law was created for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment establishes that without the intercompany vote, recognized in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, the debts incurred by Vitro's subsidiaries towards the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan.
Here are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, which the Federal Institute of Commercial Bankruptcies had secured debts.
Moreover, what is certain is that, since there were the votes of the subsidiaries, in any case the creditors of Vitro who fought against this in the courts of the United States, that is to say the "valorite" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the majority.
The vote would have been 45 votes to 37.
A data omitted by the appeal court.
On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation he has faced since 2008 without stopping at the serious economic crisis facing the United States, affecting costs in the country.
For now, the González Sada family company will appeal to the same appeals court for the vote to take place in its entirety, i.e. with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
The insurance claim will claim non-prosperity and require review of the trial by a higher court, in this case the U.S. Supreme Court.
The most serious is that the court ignored a document sent by the Mexican government on behalf of the amicus curiae (“friend of the Court”) detailing Vitro’s proceedings under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act, noting that this freed him from agreements signed by both countries to level it up with paragraph 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, he noted that the country had adhered to the United Nations Commission on International Trade principles, i.e. rules for cross-border insolvency, which ensured fairness for debtors and creditors.
Two-part carambolage: they assume Vitro and they assume the country.
General assessment
The complaints of the unions of the Mexican Aviation Society against the former boss of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, have been ignored for several months, he was accused of fraudulent administration, the Association Syndicale des Pilotes Aviateurs has already encountered problems.
The court, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Values Commission, which is accused of obstructing justice.
According to him, the inspection authority has consistently denied providing information to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the contractor to withdraw from the F/589 trust of IXE bank 198 million pesos on behalf of the Mexicana de Aviación.
The funds would have been used for the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Administration.
As everyone knows, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They besiege the dragon mart.
Gathered over the weekend in a Caribbean University amphitheater, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, university professors, entrepreneurs and civil society members approved the creation of a broad opposition front at the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the Great Wall Country, with a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had managed to unite the governors of the Southeast area to oppose the monumental project, which is partly on protected areas and represents the greatest of all threats to the industry.
ACTA is dead
The government put forward a Senate requirement to explain under what terms and circumstances Mexico’s ambassador to Japan had signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by its English acronym ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already ancient history.
As everyone knows, it was a good thing that the Senate itself condemned this possibility, as it was considered an attack on freedom of expression on social networks.
Long-term homex

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes "Basketball is my whole life"
Basketball globetrotter "Hetin" Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life relating to the field and, thanks to him, has traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as much knowledge of the history of local basketball as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason for this is that before a brain hemorrhage sentenced him to wheelchair use in 2008, Reyes was immersed in this sport for over 60 years, whether as a lower league player, national basketball team player, manager and leader of the national team, the BSN, with the Bayamón Cowboys or as president of the basketball federation.
“I’ve worn several caps in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, like when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the national team and president of the federation during the 90s,” Reyes recalls during a visit by Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his loyal wife for more than 50 years.
“Basketball is my whole life.”
Reyes doesn't exaggerate when he makes that claim.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and souvenirs reminiscent of his unusual itinerary, testify to this.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, the ones he loves most are those that remind him of his time as a player on the Cowboys team in the mid-1950s until 1982, after spending 15 years as a co-manager or manager of the team.
“This has been my best years, the ones I’ve enjoyed the most because I’ve had the chance to compete in eight Cowboys’ championships since 1967, whether it’s as a manager, co-manager or manager.
This is a lot of years of satisfaction, including the five championships played from 1971 to 1975.
I then retired at the championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took over the team," Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had been a leader here and was at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, telling me, "I have a strong player for you, he's two meters tall.
Do you want it?"
That’s how Mincy started, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gasse, who was naturalized and who was one of the best shooters.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Gausse would help us try to win another.
He was pleased with the Cowboys' championship with Gausse, but only at a distance since in 1988 he was already the great manito of the federation.
At that time, he preferred to take advantage of his and Mincy's duties in the national team.
I remember when we first won it in the United States at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico City in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we got 4th and where we should have won the bronze medal if this Canadian judge hadn't made us play the last game again, Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you’ve ever seen?
She is one of the best, as well as the one that beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite is the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and we put a scrape on the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that won bronze at the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there were also the young (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the World Cup of 90 because of a knee problem.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and great joy at the pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended by the imbroglio of the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won gold against all forecasts.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, this is Piculín Ortiz.
His statistics at international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level like Piculín has.
And this without taking into account his trajectory in the different leagues for which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I really like the work that Leo Arill does.
For you, what is your greatest achievement within the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What do you have to do?
There are things I would have liked to have put in place, such as the regionalization of minor categories.
For example, Ponce boys only play in their area and only face teams from other corners of the island during national playoffs.
Today, young people travel and play too much when it’s not necessarily necessary.
I have at least seen the advantage of mandatory certifications and courses for executives, field staff, and referees.
It makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, watch music videos from my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren, and occasionally attend basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became known worldwide for the lead role of John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he played an unscrupulous, fearsome and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as unscrupulous oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the TV series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, passed away.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday night of complications from cancer, according to a family statement sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., the production house of "Dallas."
“Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, again playing the ironic role he loved the most,” the family said.
Larry’s family and close friends were with him in Dallas on this Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original series and in the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, his press secretary Jeffrey Lane said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and I will miss him very much.
“He was an exceptional person and he was living life to the fullest,” Gray said in a statement.
Doctors had diagnosed Larry Hagman with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and he had admitted to drinking heavily for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant liver tumor and had undergone a transplant.
Several years before "Dallas," Hagman had made himself known on television as an ordinary guy in the NBC series "Jinny of My Dreams" from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered an alluring genius, played by Barbara Eden, and brought her home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among his film roles are roles well received by critics in "The Band", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of the deliciously detestable J.R. that Larry Hagman enjoyed his greatest success.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and their relatives ran from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who Killed J.R.", invented to sustain the suspense around an episode full of emotions in which the character of Hagman is almost murdered, has generated speculation around the world and millions of dollars played in bets.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series reached an audience record at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screens and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who had shot him.
J.R. had made her pregnant and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave town, but other people also had reasons to assault her.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who was trying to get his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) interned.
“I know what it would take as an epitaph for J.R.,” Hagman said in 1988.
One should write: "This is the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only part he has lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled this Friday of Hagman as a "huge man, both on the small screen and in life".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of all of us who have had the chance to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were aired a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The five-episode recording is already finished for the second season and a sixth is underway, the channel said.
At the moment, neither Warner nor TNT have commented on how Hagman’s death will be integrated into the series.
Originally from Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who became famous with classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 when she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He made his first steps on the stage in New York in the early 1950s and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
It was there that he met the young Swedish interior designer Maj Axelsson and married him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life."
“I didn’t write anything in this book that could hurt anyone or affect them in any way,” he told reporters at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active organ donor and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist worried patients.
“I advise them, I give them back their trust, I come with them when they come for surgery and after,” he said in 1996.
I’m trying to offer them some comfort, like “Don’t be afraid, it won’t be easy for a little while, but it’s going to be okay.”
He has also been an anti-tobacco activist and has participated in several campaigns.
A course on the "End of the World" has just begun
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Charme decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was throwing there an irresistible hook: the end of the "great count" of the Mayan calendar, on December 21, which many people refer to as proof of the impending end of the world.
But Professor Charme had no idea what awaited him in the coming months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a fiscal rift that some have dubbed the “Debt Armageddon” and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where end-time Christian theorists thought the apocalypse would set off.
“I didn’t realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I’ve ever known,” Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey.
If we analyze what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we were telling it, it was a very good time.
And we must remember that what is bad is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.
And he's not the only professor to teach about "the end of the world" this semester, which will be, in theory, the last in history.
At Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker teaches the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We’re analysing this because these ideas proliferate over time,” he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios guides some human behavior.
If nuclear weapons were to fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared with real-life examples.
“I tried to inform my students about what was possible, probable, credible and impossible,” Vacker said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History Professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, teamed up to give a course, simply titled "The End of the World."
“We’re adding ‘2012’ to have the opportunity to teach the course again, in case the world doesn’t disappear,” said Professor Restall.
Despite the "imminent disaster", students must study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work “until the very night of the supposed end of the world,” Restall said.
The classes proved to be quite popular.
“It was complete in two hours,” Restall said of his course for high-level students, consisting of 35 students.
We received emails several weeks before the start of the semester from people asking if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“I’m fascinated by what people are able to do to comfort themselves,” says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers-Camden University.
For the fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, claims to have watched all the apocalyptic films.
“I had never heard of a course that taught this subject,” he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students interviewed, let alone a professor, told us to believe in the end-of-the-world date of December 21.
“Our first project was about the Mayan prophecy, and in some ways we discredited it,” said Julie zegle, a 21-year-old senior student at Temple and a native of West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world, it’s just a key date on the calendar, Restall said.
But I concede that there is an apocalypse-related anxiety in Western culture, dating back several centuries, that makes people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has sparked an upsurge of such speculation.
“In other parts of the world, people don’t think about it,” he said.
This is mostly the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a religion professor at La Salle University who is teaching in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew we were teaching here about “the end of the world.”
“The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world,” he replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall notes that over the years, there has been talk of the many supposed dates of the last judgment, and he says that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing about the fact that December 21 marks the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date lightly.
Many told us that they thought they were going to "end-of-the-world" parties.
“Sometimes I call friends and we laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
