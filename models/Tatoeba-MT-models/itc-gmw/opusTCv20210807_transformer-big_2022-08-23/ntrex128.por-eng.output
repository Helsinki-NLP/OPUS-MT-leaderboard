Members of the Assembly of Wales fear 'passing through Marretas'
There is a dismay on the part of some Members of the Assembly of Wales (AM) regarding the suggestion that its title be changed to MWP (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
The source of this controversy is in the plans to change the name of the assembly to "Welsh Parliament".
Some members of this assembly, from all political backgrounds, fear that this will make them look ridiculous.
A labor ministry said the group is concerned that "the designation rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For non-Welsh readers: in the Welsh language, "twp" means "idiot" and pwp means "excrement".
A Plaid AM stated that the group as a whole was “not happy” and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative MP said the group was "open-minded" about the name change, but said the MWP designation was verbally very close to Muppet (Marreta).
In this context, the letter w in Welsh has a similar pronunciation to the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Committee, currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, stated: "The final decision on how Assembly Members are appointed will obviously be made by themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave its assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which found widespread support for the proposal to designate the assembly as the "Welsh Parliament".
On the issue of the title of the AMs, the Commission favoured "Deputies of the Welsh Parliament", or WMP, but the MWP option was more favoured in a public consultation.
Apparently, the AM are suggesting alternatives, but the effort to gather consensus may be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to table a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes to how the Assembly carries out its activities, such as rules on the disqualification of AMs and the configuration of the commission system.
When they debate the legislation, the AM will have the final say on the question of how they should be designated.
Macedonians will vote to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with neighboring Greece, which integrates a province with the name of Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor constitutes a complaint about its territory, having repeatedly objected to its requests to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is nothing more than the price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin’s Bells Shut Down as Harlem Churches Struggle for Survival
“From a historical perspective, the seniors I spoke to told me there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Mr. Adams said.
"Today, there is neither one nor the other."
The disappearance of the bars, he said, was understood.
“People socialize differently” today, he said.
“The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly head.”
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned about the possibility that the money earned from the sale of wealth will not last as long as the leaders expect" and that sooner or later everything will return to exactly the starting point."
Churches, he added, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums inhabited by the kind of people who will not support the neighborhood’s remaining shrines.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and so it will hasten the arrival of the day when these churches will all close, as it is unlikely that most of those who move to these complexes will join these congregations."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left here in the 1930s.
The building was later taken over by a black congregation that held their services nearby.
St. Martin's was occupied by a black congregation under the auspices of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem that resisted the hiring and promotion of black employees.
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged. However, when they made plans for its reconstruction, Father Johnson's parishioners commissioned the carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the chime "the bells of the poor."
The expert who rang the bell in July called it something else: “a cultural treasure” and an “irreplaceable historical instrument.”
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also said that it was the first bell in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who moved to the largest bell at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather stated that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has happened at St. Martin’s in recent months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July, expressing its concern that this “would try to pass on the costs”, despite the fact that it was not involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old in California Lobster Scuba Diving
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday during a California lobster dive on the first day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack occurred shortly after 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour as he heard the boy scream for help, having then rowed in his direction with a group to help him out of the water.
Hammel claimed that he initially thought it was just enthusiasm for catching a lobster, but later realized that the boy was shouting "I was bitten"!
I've been bitten!
The entire area of the collarbone was torn, Hammel described what he observed when he reached the boy.
"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was transported by air to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted to critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said in a press release that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but was deemed not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper trunk.
Authorities closed access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours, for investigation purposes and for security reasons.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-style cosmetics, backed by expert assistants.
As part of a substantial initiative to gain a share in the UK cosmetics market, valued at 2.8 billion pounds, which has continued to grow as sales of fashion and household goods recede, these larger cosmetics sections will be tested in 11 stores across the country and rolled out in more stores next year if their success is demonstrated.
This investment in cosmetics stems from supermarkets’ demand for ways to use exhibit space once used for TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury’s said it would double its beauty catalog by offering up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing L'Oréal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges will also get more space with store-like brand areas like those of Boots.
The supermarket network is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that most products obey vegan precepts, something increasingly demanded by younger shoppers.
In addition, the perfume shop The Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week. The second, in Selly Oak, Birmingham, is expected to open near the end of the year.
Online shopping and the shift from food shopping habits to small daily quantities in convenience stores has led supermarkets to now have to do more to persuade customers to visit their stores.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said the stores will increasingly resemble department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight off discount stores Aldi and Lidl with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury’s has been installing Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, having also installed a number of Habitats since it acquired both chains two years ago, and claims that this has boosted grocery sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The company’s previous attempt to renovate its cosmetics and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenue from health care stores in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its 281-point pharmacy business to Lloyds Pharmacy owner Celesio three years ago for 125 million pounds.
It was said Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury skin care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the look and feel of our cosmetics sections to provide our customers with a more pleasant environment.
We also invest in specialized training of colleagues, who will be available to advise the client.
Our range of brands is designed to adapt to every need. On the other hand, the inviting environment and practical locations make us now an irresistible point of sale of beauty products that breaks with the old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby quit 11-million-pound deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones was “furious” after TV host Holly Willoughby left an 11-million-pound business with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for branding Truly household goods and accessories.
The deal had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning announced on Instagram that she would leave the partnership.
Holly Willoughby left the Dragons star Den Peter Jones in the limelight by abandoning the lucrative brand at the last minute to focus on her highly profitable new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources say Jones was “furious” when the gold-minded TV girl admitted during a tense meeting last Tuesday at her business empire’s headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new businesses (which could be worth 1.5 million pounds) meant she would no longer have time to devote to her Truly household goods and accessories brand.
The deal was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby’s fortune, estimated at 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, was announcing on Instagram that he would leave Truly, Jones was taking a plane to one of his holiday homes abroad.
A source said: “Truly was by far Holly’s top priority.
It would mean the resolution of their long-term future and would be financial support for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left everyone absolutely amazed.
No one believed what was happening on Tuesday... it was so close to launch.
There's a warehouse full of ready-to-sell items at headquarters in Marlow."
Experts believe the departure of This Morning’s presenter, who is among Britain’s most lucrative stars, could cost the company millions, given the company’s huge investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and household items, and the potential for further delays from launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, with three children, and husband Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the project as president in March.
The couples take vacations together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby is about to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV’s I’m A Celebrity show.
A source close to Jones said last night that "we do not intend to comment on his business."
Hard talk "and then we fall in love"
The US president jokingly mentioned criticism that he would be targeted by the media for making a comment that some would consider "unworthy of a president" and for revealing such a positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in so much?
Trump said in his fake voice that he was a “newscaster”.
"I didn't give in to anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, noting that it would be a big step in North Korea’s denuclearization.
However, negotiations for denuclearization are dragging on.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a “corresponding response” from the US to the first steps toward North Korea’s disarmament.
Instead, he said, the U.S. is pursuing sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his speech at the rally.
"It's going very well with North Korea," he said.
“We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this excellent relationship.”
Trump said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results: an end to rocket tests, support for the release of hostages and the return to the country of the remains of U.S. military personnel.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach when talking about relations with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be worthy of a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this overcrowded arena, we would have about 200 people standing right here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly in front of him.
Tsunami and Indonesian Earthquake Cause Devastation on Island, Killing Hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok had been evicted, it was not declared a national catastrophe, a prerequisite for channelling international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they were clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it becomes a bit difficult,” Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is organizing a team that will head to Palu, there is still no guarantee that foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster response agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Despite the constant earthquakes suffered by Indonesia, the country remains terribly unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although they were built in Aceh, tsunami shelters are not commonly seen on other coastlines.
It is likely that the apparent lack of a tsunami alarm mermaid in Palu, despite the validity of a warning, had contributed to the loss of life.
In the most favorable times, traveling between the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of this new calamity.
President Joko Widodo, who made improving infrastructure decrepit a centerpiece of his election campaign, spent huge amounts on roads and railroads.
However, the funding shortage has plagued Mr. Joko’s executive as he faces re-election next year.
The president is also under pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using catanas, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge makes a long shot to tie goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with a 89th-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal, with his team losing 1-0.
He gave a tap to his left before making a shot toward the second beam.
In the attempt, the ball flew high over the large area as it headed to the upper right corner of the net.
In the end, the ball fell on a Kepa Arrizabalaga in flight and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to reach that position, to go to the ball, and players like Shaq are moving forward as much as possible, so I was just winning as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I touched him, and I didn't think too much about it.
Chelsea won 1-0 in the half after scoring a goal in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In that move, the blue forward took a heel pass back to Mateo Kovacic before unmarking near the midfield and making a sprint towards the Liverpool area.
Kovacic made a quick pass to midfield.
He then made a beautiful shot that crossed the opposing defense, leading Hazard to the big area.
He overtook the defenses and scored against the second-beam net with a left-footed shot that passed Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool face Naples in the Champions League group stage at three o'clock on Wednesday afternoon at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at three o’clock on Thursday afternoon in London.
Death toll in Indonesia tsunami rises to 832
The death toll in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami surged to 832, the country's disaster response agency said on Sunday.
There are reports of a large number of people trapped in the wreckage of buildings that collapsed during the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday, which triggered waves that reached 6 meters high, the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the rubble of the collapsed buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man on Suspicion of Murder After Stabbing Woman to Death
A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. with gunshot wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged the area's population that they may have witnessed something to give information.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to appeal to everyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and who witnessed something suspicious contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone who may have obtained images with apron cameras, particularly taxi drivers, to contact us as they may have information crucial to the investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was located inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the victim went to the scene to inquire about where she had been found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, with police saying they are currently informing the victim's close relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to access his apartment, but was told by police that entry or exit from the building is prohibited.
When he was told what had happened, he was speechless.
Residents are now being informed that they will only be able to return to their homes in hours.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene bathed in tears.
He repeatedly says, "It's so horrible."
At two o’clock in the afternoon, two police vans were inside the cordon and another was parked in the immediate outside area.
A number of police officers were deployed inside the cordon to guard the apartment building.
We ask anyone who has information to contact by DM ?MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 indicating registration 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue of Parliament became the latest monument swallowed by the contention of "historical revisionism"
Its removal would constitute an act of poetic justice for its destruction, reminiscent of that perpetrated by the Taliban, of so many English cultural and religious artifacts, and which was carried out by their fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick’s suggestion as “crazy” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that, in the current debate over the removal of statues, Oliver Cromwell’s figure at Westminster Palace would become a target to be shot down.
The iconoclasty of English civil wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed for the acts of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a testament to nineteenth-century opinion and part of historiography regarding a figure that many still believe to be worthy of homage.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more so in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures, in his case, of the monarchy.
Whether or not this constitutes an entirely accurate description is the subject of a continuing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-seventeenth century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and that Cromwell is a figure with individual notoriety representing one side of that division.
His successes as Lord Protector are also worthy of homage and celebration.”
Pig Assassin Attacks and Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his nickname "Yuan", was found dead, with a cut artery and covered in blood, near a puddle at the market in Liupanshui, in Guizhou province, reads Sunday's South China Morning Post.
The pig farmer is preparing to inject vaccines into pigs in a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, he travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered a door to an open nearby puddle.
In that pit, he said, there was a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, weighing 227 kilograms, had attacked the pig farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were covered in blood and crushed," said the cousin, referred to by his nickname "Wu," according to the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been closed to prevent it from attacking other people while police collected evidence at the scene.
Reports say Yuan’s family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of attacks from pigs to humans have been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig immobilized a Welsh farmer against his tractor until the woman managed to frighten the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the smell of blood can function as "stimulus."
"They're just kidding.
They like to pinch, they're very curious, they don't want to hurt anyone.
We just need to show them due respect,” he said.
Remains of Hurricane Rosa likely to bring widespread heavy rain to southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, it will bring torrential rain to all of northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
At 5 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday, the Rosa caused bursts of 137 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane, located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
As it approaches the Baja California peninsula, the Rosa, now a tropical storm, will begin to push strong tropical humidity northward in the southwestern part of the US.
On Monday, it will cause precipitation that can reach 25 mm in certain areas of Mexico.
At that point, tropical humidity interacting with the looming depression will produce widespread heavy rainfall in the Southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 mm of rain could cause dangerous flash floods, littered with debris, and possibly desert landfills.
The strong tropical humidity will cause rainfall that can reach 5 to 7 mm in point areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 mm of precipitation is expected in areas of the Southwest, especially over much of Arizona.
Sudden flooding is possible with rapidly worsening conditions due to the dispersed nature of tropical rains.
It is highly discouraged to walk in the desert on foot with the threat of tropical rains.
Heavy rainfall can cause gorges to turn into brave rivers and thunderstorms will bring strong spot winds and dust clouds.
The approaching depression will bring with it heavy precipitation over parts of Southern California’s coastline.
Total rainfall of more than 12 mm is possible, which can cause small floods of debris and slippery roads.
This could be the first rainfall of the wet season in the region.
Some dispersed tropical showers will begin to occur in Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more dispersed late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
The month of October may experience strong temperature variations across the U.S. territory as the Arctic cools down. However, tropical areas will remain fairly mild.
Sometimes, this leads to drastic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is an excellent example of drastic temperature differences across the central U.S. on Sunday.
There is a difference of nearly 11 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the persistent summer heat will tend to increase and widen again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to experience a warm beginning in October, with widespread temperatures ranging between 27 and 30 degrees from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures occurring in the eastern U.S. by the end of the first half of October.
More than 20 million people attended Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million people watched yesterday on six television stations the sweeping testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court nominee, and the woman who accused him of alleged sexual abuse in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued, with stations disrupting regular programming due to a last-minute twist: an agreement drawn up by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he is absolutely certain that Kavanaugh groped her while drunk and tried to strip her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an inflamed testimony, stated that he is absolutely certain that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, a figure Nielsen found on Friday, attended the hearing.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of the other stations that broadcast it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen generally has difficulty measuring audiences of those who watch programs in offices.
To give some perspective, this is a level of audiences similar to the final of an American football game or the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators gave their strong support to Kavanaugh’s nomination, led all television stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long audience, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
Next comes CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement saying his vote would be in favor of Kavanaugh, the senator was caught on CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being verbally attacked by protesters as he tried to get into an elevator to address a Judiciary Commission hearing.
The senator remained motionless looking down on the floor while being criticized live on CNN cameras.
“I’m here before you,” said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
She was told that "you have power while so many women have no power."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said before the elevator door closed that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
Cable and broadcast stations were all covering the event live hours later, when the Judiciary Commission was voting to make Kavanaugh’s appointment proceed to a Senate plenary vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee over the next week, something the Democratic minority had been demanding.
Flake was partly convinced after talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and later with a few other senators, he made his decision.
Flake's choice was decisive, as it was evident that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May accuses critics of “doing politics” with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “doing politics” with Britain’s future and harming national interest, in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson bolstered his attack on what is known as the minister’s “Chequers Plan” for Brexit, saying a proposal that envisions Britain and the EU covering the other side’s tariffs is “totally absurd.”
Wayde Sims Homicide: Police Detain Suspect Dyteon Simpson From LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect in the deadly shooting of Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, with police saying Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered them at the scene and said they had found Simpson’s DNA in them, reports WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, police said he had fatally shot Wayde with a gun.
A bail of $350,000 was established, the lawyer said.
The forensic office of the parish of East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head that extended to the neck.
The department said the collaboration of the Louisiana State Police Action Group, the State Police Criminal Lab, Southern University Police and local residents who collaborated in the investigation led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the area’s authorities for their “diligence and effort to obtain justice.”
Sims was 20.
The 1.98-meter-tall forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
His average was 5.6 points and 2.6 bounces per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“That’s what we’re constantly worried about,” Wade said.
Volcano Ejects Ashes in Mexico City
Ashes emanating from the Popocatepetl volcano hit the neighborhoods south of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Sunday advised Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after a resumption of activity in the crater, which recorded 183 gas and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The center detected numerous deaf noises and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of gray covering car windshields in Mexico City neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have recorded an increase in activity from the volcano, located 72 kilometers from the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Confrontations between Catalan police and separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between pro-independence protesters and intervention police, as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing Catalan referendum on secession.
A group of masked separatists, caught by the intervention police, struck her with eggs and threw powdered paint, creating dark clouds of dust on streets that are usually full of tourists.
There were also clashes later, in which the police resorted to batons to contain the conflicts.
For a few hours, pro-independence groups chanting “We don’t forget, we don’t forgive” faced unionist protesters, shouting “Long live for Spain.”
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests, local media reported.
Tensions remain high in the independence-leaning region, a year after the October 1 referendum that was deemed illegal by Madrid but which was held by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly chose independence, although the turnout had been low, with a majority boycott of those opposed.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to block the ongoing vote at polling stations scattered throughout the region, resulting in violent clashes.
The pro-independence groups had camped out overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration of support for the national police.
Although it was held, this manifestation was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped Catalonia would become independent.
“Last year, we had our best moments.
I’ve seen my parents cry for joy at being able to vote, but now we’re blocked,” he said.
Despite achieving a vital but tangential victory in regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with their best-known leaders in voluntary exile or detention awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was recording the protest in support of police with his phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders detained awaiting trial since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament in next year's elections.
“To stand as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression that we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car crash into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage occurred to the gates and the building itself.
At some point, someone may have also shot a beast at the car.
Menga's attack gives Livingston a 1-0 victory over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston, promoted to the first division, shocked the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard the second loss of only two in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's attack made a difference as Gary Holt's team changed levels, with Hibernian second.
Gerrard’s team, which continues without a first-division home win this season, faces the Hearts leaders with eight more points on Sunday.
Prior to that, the Rangers will face Rapid Vienna at home in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has extended to six games its succession of unbeaten matches in the division, with head coach Holt not losing a single time since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston Loses Opportunities Against Stupid Visitors
Holt's team should have advanced on the scoreboard long before the goal, as the incisive character of his game was causing all sorts of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but was dragged in front of the goal and then Alan Lithgow only managed to direct his effort away after sneaking to find Craig Halkett's header over the goal.
The home team was pleased to let the Rangers play in front of her, knowing that it could cause problems for visitors in the stop ball moves.
And that’s how the crucial goal came about.
The Rangers gave a free and Livingston got an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson coordinated to make the pass to Menga, who gave a touch and scored from the center of the big area.
At that point, the Rangers dominated possession of the ball, but faced an impenetrable home team defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no major problems.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly into a defense.
Scott Pittman was thwarted by the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow took a tap away from another Livingston stop ball move.
Crossings to the large area of Livingston continued to come, which were successively settled, and two large-penalty claims, one after Halkett's takeover of substitute Glenn Middleton and the other after a hand, were refused by the referee.
Livingston "fenomenal" - review
Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception, continuing to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
His playing style and staff have changed little since his return to the big teams, but it is necessary to praise Holt for the way he galvanized the eleven since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was colossal, getting an extremely well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall doing their best throughout the game.
In any case, the Rangers revealed little inspiration.
Despite the excellent quality shown at times with Gerrard, the team fell far short of these standards.
Their final move was little inspired (only once they managed to open the home team), constituting a kind of warning for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan is ambiguously welcomed in Cologne
There was a smile under a blue sky on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, whose goal was to repair relations between NATO allies.
The dispute involved issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey’s access to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a gigantic new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of its country.
Police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of more than 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, were also heard, condemning both the president’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The antagonistic protests reflect the divisive character of a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist died in a collision involving a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, near 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and a rescue team intervened, but the cyclist died at the scene.
This collision comes months after another cyclist died in a leaked collision on Childers Street, about a mile from Saturday’s crash.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were trying to identify the person and inform their relatives.
Barriers and detours were placed for buses, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Agents Wounded in Riots
Six prison officers were injured in riots in a high-security male prison, the Prison Office said.
The riots, which are still ongoing, began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m.
Special agents "Tornado" were summoned to solve the problem, which involves eight inmates and is restricted to a ward.
Officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesman for Prison Services said: “Specially trained teams have been used to resolve the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it should be clear that the names of those responsible will be communicated to the police and they may spend more time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, intervention police officers were summoned to resolve a serious disorder in which personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rose Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with Sudden Floods (Drought Affected Areas May Benefit)
It’s rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that’s exactly what is predicted for early next week, when the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa crosses the Southwest Desert, implicating the risk of flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday, for southern and eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct trajectory over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a state of tropical storm or depression within 300 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed 60 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 mm of precipitation, with isolated amounts that can reach 15 mm in Arizona’s Mogollon Rim.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, may receive 3 to 5 mm, with the possibility of isolated totals that can reach 10 mm.
For those unaffected by the risks of flash floods, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, some of this precipitation may be beneficial as the Southwest is currently being affected by drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second most serious category.
First, Hurricane Rosa will reach the mainland mass crossing the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa, still in hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with winds at top speeds of 137 km/h, lies 619 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it's weakening.
Thus, it is expected to hit the coastal zone in Mexico with tropical storm strength in the afternoon or at nightfall on Monday.
Heavy rainfall may occur in parts of Mexico, posing a significant risk of flooding.
"Total rainfall of 8 to 10 mm is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with 25 mm maximum possible," weather.com said in a statement.
Rosa will then head north, crossing Mexico as a tropical storm before hitting the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then head south to Utah in the late evening hours of Tuesday.
“The main hazard expected from Rosa or her remnants is the very high precipitation in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the Southwestern U.S. Desert,” the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to produce sudden flooding and flooding of debris in the deserts, life-threatening, and flooding in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three male teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with sharp-gun wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the area of the Excelsior Terrace of Midsomer Norton, near 4 a.m.
He was transported to the hospital, where he remains "stable".
A 17-year-old teenager, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area during the night, police in Avon and Somerset said.
The agents appealed to everyone who could own cellphone footage of what happened to them to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh “was a victim of the malice and anger” of Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the relentless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh “was a victim of the malice and anger” of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, having vigorously and emotionally denied an accusation by Christine Blasey Ford that she had sexually abused her decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on his claim.
The president said on Saturday that “the American people witnessed Kavanaugh’s brilliance, quality and courage” on that day.
“A confirmation vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote by one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a brilliant public service curriculum,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred to Kavanaugh’s nomination laterally when he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not competing, but I’m actually competing,” he said.
“That’s why I’m everywhere fighting for great candidates.”
Trump argued that Democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.
The Senate's first procedural vote on Kavanaugh's appointment is scheduled to take place no later than Friday, a senior deputy in the GOP leadership told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami; number continues to rise
At least 384 people have died, many of them dragged by the giant waves that hit the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday, when waves up to six meters high hit the beach in the evening, dragging many to death and causing a trail of devastation on their way.
The tsunami occurred in the aftermath of a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still in their activities on the beach and did not immediately flee, having been victims of what happened,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster relief agency (BNPB) said in a statement in Jakarta.
“The tsunami did not move on its own: it dragged cars, logs, homes, it hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving in the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before reaching the coastline.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges warped and broken down, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The coastal city continued to be rocked by aftershocks on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
Indonesia’s Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s massive quake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have amplified the dimension of the tsunami, the statement reads.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage may be deeper along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, an area named Donggala, closer to the earthquake's epicentre.
Communications "were totally disabled and there was no information" about Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 inhabitants in the area,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for failing to report that a tsunami had hit Palu, although authorities said the waves emerged at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur footage posted on social media, you can see a man on the top floor of a building shouting frantic warnings that the tsunami was approaching, to the people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water crashed into the coast, dragging buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an extensive power outage that disrupted communications in the Palu area, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities. However, the evacuees still desperately need food and other commodities.
The city’s airport has been reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to the evacuation centers in Palau on Sunday.
Indonesia’s tsunami death toll is rising exponentially to more than 800.
It's too bad.
Although he managed to get safely to the city of Palu, where employees are housed in canvas shelters mounted in the courtyard of their offices, the staff of World Vision Donggala went through scenes of devastation on his way, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's too bad.
Even as relief groups began to begin the grim tasks of assisting the victims of the disaster, some complained that the highly experienced foreign aid workers were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and personnel can only have access to the site if it is declared a “national disaster zone”.
That hasn't happened yet.
“This is still at the level of provincial catastrophe,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says ‘OK, this is a national catastrophe’ we can open the door to international assistance, but that status does not yet exist.”
As the second night fell in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and relatives of those still missing still held out hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that attenuate the dark headlines of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was removed from a sewer.
On Sunday, first responders released a woman who had been trapped in the rubble for two days beside her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandon, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of his missing athletes for the Asian Games, which were concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others of those imprisoned at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As a senior paragliding practitioner, I have to carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon said that in the hours after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel began to circulate among the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu sportsmen who were attending the beach festival.
However, their messages produced only one gray check mark, rather than a pair of blues.
“I think that means the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Thieves take 26,750 USD during ATM refueling in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was refueling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a statement from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was emptying an ATM in the amusement complex and preparing to introduce more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was busy, another man “came up running after the Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of cash that was meant for a delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but police did not specify the number of those involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
In announcing this change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “Being formerly known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has long been nicknamed Ye and used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The move comes before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
This intervention is intended to replace that of singer Ariana Grande, who canceled it for "emotional reasons", said the creator of the show.
At the same time being an abbreviation of his current professional name, the word has a religious meaning for him, according to West.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you,’” West said earlier this year when commenting on the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m us, it’s us.
It comes from Kanye, which means “the only one,” to just Ye – being just a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was alternately known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
Former West collaborator, JAY-Z, also used variations of his name with or without hyphen and capital letters.
In Mexico, AMLO pledges not to resort to military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel López Obrador has vowed not to use military force against civilians as the country nears the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
López Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza "never to use the army to repress the Mexican people."
Militaries fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, resulting in a death toll that may have risen to 300 when leftist student movements were deployed across Latin America.
López Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving them monthly grants to students and opening more public universities.
The president said unemployment and a lack of educational opportunities are dragging young people into criminal gangs.
U.S. to double funding for artificial intelligence
At a time when China is stepping up its artificial intelligence activity, the U.S. is expected to double spending on AI research, said Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several U.S. government departments made AI-related announcements, even though the country does not have a formal overall AI-related strategy.
However, China laid out its plan last year: it intends to lead innovation in AI by 2030.
“Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the U.S. and we are in pursuit of the new AI revolution,” Lee said.
Doubting funding could double the chances of the next big AI hit being achieved by the United States, Lee told NBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, a company that invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated the top-ranked American player from Othello. Later, he held executive roles at Microsoft Research and was president of Google's branch in China.
Lee credited previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Department’s Robotics Challenge for Advanced Research Projects and asked when he would be next, in order to help identify the next visionaries.
U.S. researchers often have to make a big effort to get state funding, Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s stealing academic leaders; it’s companies,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired luminaires from universities to work in AI.
Lee said changes to immigration policies could also help the U.S. boost its AI efforts.
“I am of the opinion that green cards should automatically be granted to PhDs in AI,” he said.
The Chinese State Council presented its Next-Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in a manner similar to that used by the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations to fund researchers in the United States. However, the quality of academic work is inferior in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is intended to engage industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Restricted Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
However, U.S. legislation that intended to create a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not progressed in months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the country's name
Macedonians voted on Sunday to decide whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia," an initiative that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked its calls for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is part of a province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbour represents a complaint about its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would be a blow to the ethnic identity of the predominantly Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether the voter turnout will be enough to meet the 50% needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question in the referendum was: “Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to continue the efforts to admit bodies with the EU and NATO to Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live free under the auspices of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," Olivera Georgijevska, 79, said in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The National Election Commission said there had been no reports of irregularities until one o’clock in the afternoon.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to the 34% obtained in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters showed up to vote.
“I came to vote for my children; our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter from the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in the referendum on the change of name of the country, which would open the doors for their accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and putting chairs in front of the tents set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our head up and not through the service door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said joining NATO would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favor, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after giving his vote.
According to him, a “yes” would be the “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published Monday by Macedonia’s Political Research Institute revealed that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70% said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, the turnout must be over 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first major flaw in the policy of the pro-Western government since taking office in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City crosses all of Brighton's defense towards the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling obliterated Brighton's defense in the 2-0 win against Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy on his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward received a halfway pass at the start of the game.
He sprinted between three Brighton defenses before cutting to hit open field.
He was surrounded by four green shirts.
Fake a defense before neutralizing in the race more others on the edge of the great area of Brighton.
He then made a pass to his left where Sterling was.
The English forward used his first touch in the big area to return the ball to Aguero, who, with his right boot, defeated Brighton Mathew Ryan's goalkeeper with a shot on the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with some foot problems," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We said he would play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial lead in the Premier League confrontation.
That goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball right into Brighton's territory in this move.
He made a pass over the defenses along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
This gave some touch before driving Sterling towards the second beam.
The Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net immediately before sliding out of the bounds of the field.
City face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make life harder for the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the final, there was not much reason to force another start.
However, the ever-competitive Scherzer has hopes of entering the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications for the final for the Rockies, who have a lead in a game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies were at least lucky with a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but they still intend to secure their first division title.
"Even though we're playing for nothing, at least we can get on the field knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd, the other team will probably play at the highest level I could face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete in those conditions?”
The Nationals have not yet announced the title launcher for Sunday, but some say they are inclined to allow Scherzer to make the launches in this situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, had a bullpen session on Thursday and would launch into his normal position on Sunday.
The right-handed Washington player goes with 18-7, with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The president laterally referred to the situation involving his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while mentioning the importance of Republican influx in the midterm elections.
“Everything we did is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
“This is one of the big, big ... I’m not competing, but I’m competing and that’s why I’m everywhere fighting for excellent candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You’re seeing this horrible, horrible group of radical Democrats, you’re seeing it happen right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all means necessary.
They don’t care who they attack, who they have to go over to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, and we’re not going to give them.”
Democrats, he said, have a mission to “resist and obstruct.”
“And they’ve seen that in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “aggressive, bad, sordid and liars.”
The president named Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, after having received loud voices from the public.
"Remember your answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, I, wait, a--that was really bad body language--the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer inclusive.
He is intolerant of those who openly give his opinion.
When Momentum activists from my local party organization voted to censor me, it was no surprise to me.
At the end of the day, I am the latest in a series of Labour Members of Parliament who have been told that they are not welcome - all because we openly express our views.
My colleague in parliament Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she resolutely faced anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East labor notice on Friday mentioned that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a local labour representative in parliament, the General Committee meetings were just that.
Unfortunately, today it has ceased to be the tone of many of the meetings and the promise of "kinder and gentler" policy has long been forgotten, if ever it has come true.
It has become increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and that every opinion is judged on whether or not it is acceptable by the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy took the lead, as colleagues with whom I thought he shared a similar political perspective began to expect me to turn around and take positions I would never agree with – either on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public (and it doesn’t really matter what I say), there follows a torrent of insults on social networks that call for “dismissal,” denouncing the center’s policies, telling me that I shouldn’t belong to the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only one going through this.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments addressed to me tend to be of a political nature.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a barrage of sexist or racist insults every day, but who never back down from them.
One of the things that disappoints me the most in this era of politics is how these levels of insults have become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we have ceased to be inclusive, and with each motion of “censorship” or change of the rules of selection the party narrows its views.
I have received numerous advice over the past two years urging me to keep my head down, so as not to be so expressive, and so "it would be all right" for me.
But that's not what I came to do politics for.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, driven by the neglect of Thatcher’s government that left my comprehensive school classroom literally in rubble, I have sought to fight for better public services for those who need them most, whether as mayor or minister in government.
I never hid my policies, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been somewhat confused about my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I have to say is that when the country heads for a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our utilities, I don’t understand the desire to waste time and energy on the issue of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: the unbeatable Ayr goes to the top
Two late rehearsals somehow sent out the result, but there’s no doubt Ayr deserved to succeed in this incredibly interesting Tennent’s Premiership game of the day.
The team is now at the top of the table, the only one of the ten without defeats.
In the end, it was a superior defense and better management of the risks that made the home team take better, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested in our games so far and we’re still unbeatable, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "The merit goes to Ayr. They manage the risks better than we do."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute rehearsal, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, ceded to the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to give expression to the numbers, having Jason Baggot taken advantage of an unconverted rehearsal.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a big penalty, before, just before halftime, he scored and then converted a solo rehearsal to put the score at 17-5 for Ayr at halftime.
However, Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's rehearsal, converted by Baggot, reduced the draw to five points.
A long break followed due to a severe injury from Ruaridh Knott, who was transported by stretcher to the outside and, after the restart, Ayr strengthened the lead with a rehearsal by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain, Blair Macpherson, then received a yellow card and, once again, Melrose took advantage of the numerical advantage with an unconverted rehearsal of Bruce Colvine at the end of an intense rush of pressure.
However, the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for knocking down Climo without the ball, in the penalty throw, MacPherson put the ball on the ground behind the maul in Ayr's progress.
Climo converted, as he had done almost immediately after the reboot, after Kyle Rowe had picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent the Gregor Henry wing to the fifth rehearsal of the home team.
Still Game Star Ready for a New Career in the Restoration Business
Ford Kieran, the star of the Still Game, seems ready to enter the catering industry after learning that he has been appointed director of a licensed catering company.
The 56-year-old actor portrays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and performs with longtime comedian partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that season nine, coming soon, will be the last in the series, and it looks like Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source at Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was intending to engage in the “flowering Glasgow restoration business.”
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, a landlocked country, hopes that the court will restore a path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a rope-covered naval base in La Paz.
Public buildings carry a navy blue flag.
The naval bases of Lake Titicaca for the Amazon bear the motto: “The sea is ours by right.
Retrieving it is a duty.”
Across landlocked Bolivia, the memory of a lost coastline to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still alive, as is the longing to sail once again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps at the highest point in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, a positive outlook on the outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the TIJ’s sentencing on giant screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will rule in favor of their country’s claim, so that after decades of uncertain negotiations, Chile will be forced to negotiate, granting Bolivia a sovereign exit into the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous Bolivian president facing a controversial re-election battle next year, also has a lot at stake in Monday’s ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," the president said in August.
However, some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will rule in favor of Bolivia, and that little would change even if not.
The United Nations body, based in the Netherlands, has no power to assign Chilean territory to another country and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the IJC’s sentence was handed down just six months after the hearing of the final allegations indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And far from promoting the Bolivian cause, the last four years may have harmed it.
“The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric undermined some residual Chilean goodwill, he suggested.
At some point in the future, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult to maintain the dialogue after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision process was unusually fast.
Next Monday will give Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The sentence is an opportunity to understand that we have to go beyond the past.”
North Korea Says There Will Be No Disarmament Without U.S. Reliance
North Korea’s foreign minister Ri Yong Ho said his nation would never give up its nuclear weapons if it did not trust Washington first.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
In his speech, he urged the United States to fulfill the promises it made during a summit in Singapore among the leaders of rival countries.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart stalemate nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after Singapore's summit with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was an “impossible dream” to consider that continued sanctions and U.S. objections to a declaration putting an end to the Korean war will ever bring the North to its knees.
Washington is afraid to accept the declaration without Pyongyang taking the first significant steps toward disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang really intends to reduce an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest line of huge hats on their way to a store near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, you don’t need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the catwalk a series of extravagant and oversized hats for their spring-summer 2019 collections, which stunned the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram was flooded with very impractical hats and these designers sent these amazing creations to the catwalk.
Valentino’s most prominent piece was an extravagant beige hat adorned with a wide feather-like flap that flooded the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jewellery-sewn watermelons, a sorcerer’s hat, and even a pineapple, though they weren’t designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks... even in time for the carnival.
Many of the colorful masks had cooked lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One of the creations resembled diving gear, with tube and glasses, while the other looked like a molten ice cream cone.
And if you want to continue this immense fashion statement, you're in luck.
Styling observers predict that these huge hats are on their way to a store near you.
The oversized hats appear effervescent on the path of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 61 cm flap that has been worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the very impractical hat that spread through social networks sent another great creation to the catwalks: a straw beach bag almost as big as the model in a bathing suit that carried it.
The raffia bag in burnt orange, adorned with raffia fringes and with a white leather handle, was the highlight of Jacquemus’ 2019 La Riviera spring-summer collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I’m looking forward to seeing great hats and beach bags hit the stores next summer. Since the designer had such an impact, it would be hard to ignore the search for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland benefit from a curriculum of academic excellence, and this trend continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam results, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community initiatives.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to get the best level of service for both students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further study and access to universities, as well as for the career they have chosen and to take their place as global citizens.
Since this is an educational sector capable of designing and implementing a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and sought-after topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If we speak to a man in a language he understands, we can get into his mind.
If we speak to him in his own language, we can get into his heart.”
This quote reminds us well that we can’t just rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of this year’s recent exams, we found that languages are at the top of the table, with the highest rates of use of independent schools.
A total of 68% of the students who studied foreign languages reached the maximum grade of A.
These data, collected in the 74 schools under the SCIS, show that 72% of students obtained the maximum grade of A in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This demonstrates that Scottish independent schools are favouring foreign languages as vital skills that will unquestionably serve children and young people in the future.
Languages, as an option, are now viewed in the same way as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) topics in the curricula of independent schools and beyond.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills found that, among the reasons for employers’ difficulty filling vacancies, 17% were related to language skills shortages.
Therefore, knowing other languages is increasingly an imperative to prepare the young generation for their future careers.
With more potential job opportunities requiring language proficiency, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of your chosen career, if you have learned a second language, you will have a tangible advantage in the future with a life-style aptitude like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, with French being the only language spoken by a double-digit ratio of 15%.
Investing in language learning is important for children today.
Multilingual skills, particularly in developing countries, will give children the best chance of finding a relevant job.
In Scotland, every school differs in the languages it teaches.
Some of them will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages considered the most important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be a set of languages of choice in independent schools, supported by teaching staff specialized in the area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a pedagogical environment that prepares children and gives them the skills they need for success, whatever the future holds for them.
It is undeniable that today, in a globalized business environment, languages continue to be of fundamental importance for the future of the country. Therefore, it is necessary to reflect it in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to make this option available with diversity and excellence to young Scots.
It has to be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron starts at the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is coming to an end for fans looking to see LeBron James kick off at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, head coach of the Lakers, announced that James will be playing in Sunday’s preseason opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, how many minutes you will play is still to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers journalist Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game schedule in the preseason.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to be ready,” he said.
Time and YouTube channel of the Trump rally in West Virginia
President Donald Trump begins a round of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s the first of five rallies scheduled for next week, which include stops at friendly locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the conformation vote on hold for his chosen Supreme Court vacancy, Trump intends to bolster support for the midterm elections to be held soon as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress following the November vote.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. Eastern Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s West Virginia rally online below in a live stream on YouTube.
Trump will likely address this week’s hearings of Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court nominee, who have become tense over allegations of sexual abuse. The Senate confirmation vote will be on hold for a week as the FBI proceeds with investigations.
However, the main goal of this torrent of rallies is to help Republicans, who face tough elections in November, gain some momentum.
President Trump’s campaigners have said the five rallies next week are meant to “energize volunteers and supporters at a time when Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majorities they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Congressional control is so critical to the president’s agenda that he will visit as many states as possible as we approach the turmoil of the campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman said.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the early evening rally could attract supporters “from Ohio to Pennsylvania and get coverage of the Pittsburgh area media,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday marks the second time this month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate nominee Patrick Morrisey to a disadvantage in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to help him with the polls," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team demonstrates strength to fight to keep hope alive ahead of Sunday singles
After three uniform sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes could be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
Pendulum momentum swing is a fully invented sporting concept, but it’s one that players truly believe in, and never more so than in competitions like these.
So where would you say the momentum will come now?
"They had a six-point lead and now they're four, so we're looking at it as a bit of momentum, I'd say," Spieth said as he was leaving the field at the end of the day.
Europe is ahead, of course, with four points ahead and twelve more at stake.
Americans, as Spieth claims, still have some spare energy and plenty of reason to feel encouraged, especially given the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them scored three points in four.
Spieth has been deadly from tee to green and is leading by example.
Those festive guttural cries became louder as the round went on, with a crucial putt that made the fourth match an all-square when he and Thomas were two holes behind in two.
His putt who won the 15th game produced a similar scream, of the kind that reveals he still believes the American team remains in the competition.
“We just need to focus and worry about our own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all that’s left for each of these players.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup reveal.
The European pair, improbable but adorable, is four in four and can't go wrong.
The "Moliwood" was the only duet not to do a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning back nine.
In this series, and given the way their energy seems to flow from and to this turbulent crowd, the idea is consolidated that they are the players beating on Sunday, and that there is no player more popular to seal a potential European win at the Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both simultaneously in different holes.
However, the discourse on the glory of Europe remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of this morning's fourballs, when teaming up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine put the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they were never close to leaving.
However, on Sunday, there is no one to help them get out of it.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to see up close because of the interactions between partners, the advice they give or not and the way the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better in a team so far and gained a significant lead on the final day, but this foursome session has also shown that the US team has the stomach for the fight that some, especially in the United States, doubted it had.
Europe with a 10-6 lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a head start after exiting the fourballs and foursomes of Saturday’s games with a 10-6 lead against the United States.
The inspired duet of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to reach the four-point Le Golf National standings so far.
Thomas Bjorn’s European team, struggling to keep the trophy he lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an unsuccessful American team in the morning fourballs, winning the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes with two wins, but failed to shorten the draw.
Jim Furyk’s team needs eight points on Sunday’s 12th singles to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to earn four points in a row when he and Molinari, who have been dubbed "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend are only the only duet to earn four points in their four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they superbly consolidated the lead, defeating a powerless Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who crawled during two games on Saturday, revealed occasional bouts of genius, but has already lost 19 of the games he played in fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, first and third ranked in the world.
However, on this pleasant day with a light breeze southwest of Paris, Europe didn’t always get the best.
Jordan Spieth, three-time winner of the major men’s tournaments, and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for Americans with two points on Saturday.
The duet scored a brave 2&1 win over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain, and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes, having lost both opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team reversed a four-point draw before singles, though Furyk’s title-holder team only needs to tie to keep the trophy.
After two days in second position, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be beyond his ability.
North Korea says 'never think' of unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were aggravating distrust of the United States and that there was no way the country could unilaterally dispense with its nuclear weapons under those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant goodwill measures” last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test center, and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies.
"However, we do not see any corresponding U.S. response," he said.
“Without trust in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances there is no way we can proceed to our disarmament first.”
Although Ri has recycled already-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” approach to denuclearization, under which North Korea would be rewarded as it made gradual steps, his statements appear to be significant in that they do not limynarily reject unilateral denuclearization, in contrast to Pyongyang’s previous positions.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to work toward “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump offered security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States claims that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on “denuclearization first” and raises the level of pressure with sanctions to reach its goal coercively, opposing even the “declaration of the end of the war,” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an impossible dream of people who know nothing about us.
However, the problem is that prolonging sanctions is compounding our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that had been referred to by the U.S. leader at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: “If the stakeholder in this issue were South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this impasse.”
Still, the tone of Ri’s speech was drastically different from last year when he told the U.N. General Assembly that steering North Korea’s rockets toward U.S. territory was inevitable after “Mr. Bad President” Trump called Kim the “rocket man” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps toward disarmament, but said much remained to be done and sanctions would have to continue until North Korea's denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a timetable for it, saying “whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The enforcement of Security Council sanctions must proceed vigorously until denuclearization is complete, final and verifiable.”
The Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to strangle funding for North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, though North Korea later denounced him for "making gangster demands.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear complex if the United States “takes corresponding action.”
Pompeo said Kim had told him that the “corresponding measures” they sought were Trump’s security guarantees in Singapore, as well as initiatives to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course that teaches them how to get enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year has put all its students to sleep more, in an initiative to combat the sexist culture of studying in caffeine-soaked “directs.”
One professor concluded that students at this university at the top of the world rankings often had no idea about the most basic concepts about caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, was the author of the course, which he believes to be the first of its kind in the United States.
The inspiration for the course came after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"In the end, a girl came to me and said, 'Why are you just telling me this in the last year of the course?'
She said no one had ever mentioned the importance of sleep to her, which surprised me,” she told The Telegraph.
The course, first taught this year, explains to students the essential concepts about how good sleep habits contribute positively to academic and athletic performance, as well as to the improvement of overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the institution decided to introduce the course after concluding that some students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a dormitory where students click on coffee mugs, curtains, shoes and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, and about how athletic performance is influenced by sleep deficiency, and the importance of a routine to collect to bed.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risks of stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then, a campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know it won’t change the behavior of students instantly.
However, we believe they have a right to know, as we all have a right to know the health effects of the smoking option,” added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in “doing direct” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students makes this a growing problem.
Ensuring that we get enough and quality sleep should be a “secret weapon” for students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid getting fat, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of physical biology and chemistry, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year at Harvard.
The course opened his eyes and inspired him to encourage the creation of a campus-wide course, he said.
The next step, according to their expectations, is to ask all postgraduate students to attend a similar study program before entering the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to consider using an alarm when going to bed, as well as when waking up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can deregulate the circadian rhythm and lead to problems falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal knocks down Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another bout of sadness away from home when Dolly Menga's attack caused Steven Gerrard's disjointed team a 1-0 loss at Livingston Stadium.
Ibrox's team was looking to score their first victory on their way since a 1-0 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team ultimately inflicted Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, leaving his team eight points behind unbridled Scottish First Division leader Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the end of the first part and the uninspired Rangers collective never seemed to be able to match.
With the Rangers now descending to sixth position, Livingston rises to third, and only behind the Hibernian for the goal difference.
And even more problems could arise for the Rangers after Chief Prosecutor Calum Spence received treatment for a head injury caused by an object apparently thrown from the visitor’s area.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that surpassed Ayr in the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, meanwhile, used the same eleven from Livingston who stole a point from Hearts last week, and will have been delighted with how his well-oiled team suffocated opponents on every move.
The Rangers may have dominated possession, but Livingston did more with the one he had.
The team could have scored within two minutes, when the first pass sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder wasted his big opportunity outside.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs went to meet Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow managed only to finish out towards the second beam.
The Rangers managed to regain control, but hope was greater than belief in their game in the final third.
Certainly Alfredo Morelos thought he should have been given a big penalty to the quarter-hour with his collision with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson refused the Colombian appeals.
The Rangers only got two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to worry about Lassana Coulibaly’s header and Ovie Ejaria’s weaker shot.
Although Livingston’s goal in the 34th minute may have been contrary to what was expected from the game’s development, it is undeniable that the team deserved it, let alone its tenacity.
Once again, the Rangers failed to deal with a Jacobs long stop ball play.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher made a pass to Scott Robinson, who kept calm when he chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard moved in the interval, having replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and this trade almost had immediate impact when the forward side moved to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly sprinted from his line to effect the blockage.
However, Livingston continued to force visitors to play exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett making long passes behind long passes.
Holt's team may have increased their lead in the final stages, but McGregor held out well, defending against Jacobs before Lithgow finished out in the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton again claimed a large penalty when he embarrassed Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored the request.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Almanac "Sunday Morning": On September 30, 1882, it is today 136 years old and continues to tell ...the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A fundamental piece of science since then, the accountant Geiger has also become a central element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" in which the unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans participated:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like a uranium.
When we put these headphones on, we can even hear the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity on the minerals.”
Evans: "Look, it's really cracking now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention to which he gave the name still endures.
New Cancer Vaccine Teaches Your Immune System to “See” Harmful Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Teaches the Immune System to “See” Harmful Cells and Kill Them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their alteration in the laboratory.
These cells, which can “see” a protein common to many cancers, are then injected back into the body.
An experimental vaccine is producing promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their modification in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2. These cells are then again injected into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “controls the growth of various types of cancer,” including those of the breast, ovary, lungs and also colorectals, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and “teaching” them to attack cancer cells worked in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarks on a diatribe of support for Trump wearing a MAGA hat after his appearance on the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was busted in the studio on Saturday Night Live after an incoherent performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump, saying he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his song of the night, under the name of Ghost Town, in which he wore a hat "Make America Great", he started a bravado against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So many times I talk to a white guy and he says, 'How can you like Trump?
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL began with a satire with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star twisted Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee over allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it had not been broadcast, the scene of West's bravado was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to mock West when he did it.
In addition, West had complained to the public that he had had a bad time behind the scenes because of the hat.
“They intimidated me behind the scenes.
They told me, "Don't go there with that hat."
They intimidated me!
And then they tell me I’m marginalized,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see marginalization?", saying that "I'd put on my superman cover, because that means no one tells me what to do.
Try love."
His comments sparked public outcry and SNL participants appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported, with someone from the show telling the newspaper: "The whole studio was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had passed away a few days ago.
West confused many with the performance of the song I Love it disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West received a rally of support from conservative TPUSA group director Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of our bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR FIGHTING TURBA.”
Interview show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply “being what it is, and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But I chose NOT to reward someone (buying your music or supporting your ‘art’) who I believe is welcoming and propagating harmful ideologies to the community.
He's free.
And so do we,” he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he was now “the one formerly known to Kanye West.”
West is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper Snoop Dogg once used the name Snoop Lion, and of course the missing musical legend Prince changed the name to a symbol and then to "the artist formerly known as Prince".
Prosecution of attempted murder after stabbing Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to be brought before the Belfast court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the prosecutor.
Star of the War of Thrones Harington Kit Attacks Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his fencing role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series, War of the Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor attacked the sexist hero's stereotype, saying that such on-screen roles make boys often feel they have to be tough to be respected.
In a conversation with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said she believes “something went wrong” and wondered how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the ?MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married her 31-year-old war of the throne colleague Rose Leslie, has admitted that she has a “quite strong stance” on addressing the problem.
“I have a pretty strong personal stance right now: what went wrong with masculinity?” he said.
“What have we been teaching men when they’re growing up in terms of the problem we’re seeing now?”
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued, “What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes young people feel they have to belong to this particular form of masculinity?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time: how can we change that?
Because clearly something went very wrong for the young people.”
In the interview, the actor also admitted that he would not enter any prequels or sequels of the War of the Thrones when the series ends next summer, noting that, for him, the "battlefields and the horses" were over.
Starting in November, Kit will be taking part in a reissue of Sam Shepard’s True West, which is the story of a movie producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he believes finding his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of the War of the Thrones.
“I met my wife on this show, so somehow she gave me my future family and my life from now on,” she said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple gave the knot in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie’s family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases result from transmissions through sexual intercourse, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to virtually zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in terms of annual homologous variation, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is said to be frequent.
Studies have estimated that due to conservative values in the country, 70 to 90% of men who have had sex with other men end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of disease stem from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leak of information about Republican senators by her collaborator and attacks "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her team posted personal information from three U.S. Senate members on lawmakers’ Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the accusations were being promoted by opinion leaders and “ultra-right” websites.
"Lies, lies and more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information allegedly includes the addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a hearing with a Senate panel on allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court nominee.
The leak came some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was associated with Waters’ office and published the data of a Waters staffer, The Hill reported.
“This groundless accusation is utterly false and an absolute lie,” Waters said.
“My collaborator, whose identity, personal data and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations, had no responsibility for this leak.
This groundless accusation is utterly false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly drew criticism online, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is choleric,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests she doesn’t have the temperament to be a congresswoman.
When someone is accused of something that is not their responsibility, they cannot become angry.
You can't have a challenging posture.
You can't question the accuser's motives.
You have to show calm and serenity.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by critics of appearing too choleric during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who will run for Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“It’s very serious if it’s true,” he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted “competent authorities” to these fraudulent allegations.
“We ensure that the culprits will be revealed and will be legally held responsible for all their acts, which are destructive and dangerous to any and all members of my staff.”
Review of Johnny English Returns to Attack - Weak Espionage Film Parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now fashionable to look for connotations with Brexit in any new film with a British flavor, and this seems to apply to the new edition in the Johnny English comedy-action film series, begun in 2003 with "Johnny English" and brought back to life in 2011 with "The Return of Johnny English".
Is the ironic self-satire about being so bad the new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his squeaky eyes and an overly elastic expression, obtained his license to create confusion, renewed a second time - with his name to signal, above all, that it is a comprehensive comic creation aimed at non-English-speaking moviegoers.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretensions to a soft glamour, has a bit of Closeau, a hint of Mr. Bean, and something of that guy who contributed a single note to the theme of the movie "Moments of Glory" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
In addition, his character is originally based on the international traveler and mysterious man whose role Atkinson played in the TV ads for the Barclaycard, which left chaos in his wake.
There are one or two interesting moments in this latest edition of JE.
I loved the scene where Johnny English approaches a helicopter winging a medieval armor, with the rotor blades briefly making a chime noise against the helmet.
Atkinson's talent for comedy is evident, but humor sounds weak and strangely superfluous, especially given that "serious" film editions like 007 and Mission Impossible now confidently propose comedy as an ingredient.
We get the idea that humor is directed at children and not adults and, in my opinion, Johnny English’s bizarre misadventures are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s silent film numbers in Bean’s character.
Now, the premise, always current, is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker infiltrated the super-secret British spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground to the dismay of the service agent, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the last straw for a prime minister who embodies a pompous and conflicting figure, already suffering a total dislocation of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this role that reminds the character of Theresa May, but the plot doesn’t give much material for big flights.
Her secret service advisors inform her that once all the agents in the asset have been compromised, she will have to take someone out of retirement.
And that someone is the disgraced Johnny English, now working as a teacher at a chic school, but giving unofficial lessons on how to be an infiltrated spy: there are some interesting numbers here, because English offers us a spy academy in the style of the film "Rock School".
English is quickly taken to Whitehall to receive emergency instructions and rejoin his long-suffering assistant Bough, a role played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, strapped to a submarine commander, a quirky character in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
Thus, the Batman and Robin of Her Majesty's Secret Service catastrophe are back in action, facing off against the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, the role played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being dangerously bewitched by the charismatic tech billionaire he claims can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ludicrous acts: disguised as clerks, setting fire to a French restaurant, creating confusion by penetrating like clandestines on Volta’s luxurious yacht, and English unleashes pure anarchy as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta’s house.
All the stops were certainly created in view of this last sequel, but as nice and tempestuous as it is, the set has plenty of children's TV.
The result is pretty median.
And just like in the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help wondering: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that will do justice to his talent?
Workers deny they are making a plan for Britons to work four days a week, but get five.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party may be considering a radical plan to provide the British with a four-day work week, but with five days’ pay.
Reports suggest that the party wants employers to pass on savings with the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers, granting them an extra day off.
Workers would get a three-day weekend, but keeping the wages.
Sources say the idea would “adjust” to the party’s economic program, which reorients the country in favor of the workers.
The move to a four-day work week garnered the favorable opinion of the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changes in the economy.
A senior Labour official told The Sunday Times: “We look forward to announcing a policy review before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an aspiration adjusted to the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of the worker, as well as the party’s overall strategy for the industrial sector.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party had already proposed a four-day work week during its campaign for the 2017 legislative elections.
However, this aspiration is not favored at this time by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesman for the party said: “The four-day work week is not part of the party’s policy and we are not considering it.”
Shadow finance minister John McDonnell used the party conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from the hands of “faceless executives” and the “speculators” of basic services companies.
Their plans also include failing to recover the full shareholding of current water companies, given that the Labour Party may make "deductions" based on the perception of illegal conduct.
McDonnell also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create Inclusive holding funds that transfer 10% of the private company’s share to employees, who will be able to pocket annual dividends that can amount to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could make them change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week, raising questions about whether the findings could lead Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview to air Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
"I said when I was going to the hearing, I said, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
Did I call him after this happened, when this allegation came up, and ask him, "Did you do it"?
He was resolute, determined, unequivocal.”
Graham's vote, however, seems unassailable.
"I am determined about Brett Kavanaugh and an explosive charge would be needed," he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett made a vigorous denial,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And everyone she mentioned couldn’t confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Did you do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive list of stars who will perform on an equally impressive mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
Already in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will welcome tens of thousands of people in the Great Lawn of Central Park, not only to attend performances such as those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to reinforce awareness for the true goal of the event: to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket) viewers have had to perform a number of tasks, or “actions,” such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, a phone call, or any other meaningful ways that contribute to raising awareness for the goal of ending poverty.
However, how successful has Global Citizen been in achieving its goal over the past 12 years?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way of persuading them to demand action, or is this just another case of “cliquetivism” – do we think it makes any difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters that have put pressure on it to achieve a range of different goals.
These actions, according to the organization, have contributed to world leaders announcing commitments and policies valued at more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its shares, with at least 10 billion dollars related to them already disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the funds obtained so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership bringing together investors and implementers committed to “helping children reach their full potential,” which has pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help end undernutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like all of us, we can make social injustice of undernutrition a footnote in history,” Tracey Ullman, an ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told a crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 pressure actions on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced that it would fund a project, Power of Nutrition, which will cover 5 million women and children, with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the site’s frequently asked questions, “What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responds: “It’s been a long and tortuous journey – sometimes we’ve fallen and failed.
But like the big civil rights and anti-apartheid movements that preceded us, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US May Use Navy as 'Blockade' to Put Obstacle to Russia's Energy Exports - Home Secretary
“If necessary,” Washington can turn to its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria, in particular, where it intervenes at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to mediate energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the belly to the south of Europe,” he said.
And, according to the ruler, there are ways and means to prevent it.
“The United States has the capability, with its navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, to blockade to ensure that energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed participants at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that calls itself “the voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
In his speech, he went on to compare Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, saying they are effectively the same.
“The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to leverage and replace fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as a “one-trick magician” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is on a mission to increase natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is the far cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including the president himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the “inadequate” Nord Stream pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stated that the US$11 billion Nord Stream pipeline aims to double existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is motivated simply by economic reasons, being an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument for exerting pressure and that consumers should have the ability to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position prompted a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, the head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “deeply analyze” the possibility of running for president in 2020, said the Massachusetts Senator.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would “deeply analyse” the possibility of running for president in the aftermath of the midterm elections.
During an informal public debate in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed he would consider applying.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington to repair our dysfunctional government, and that includes a woman as the top official,” she said.
“After November 6, I will look deeply at the possibility of running for president.”
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the informal debate, saying he was “leading the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has been a vocal critique of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said that “of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll conducted on Thursday revealed that most of Warren’s own constituents do not believe she should run for president in 2020.
Fifty-nine percent of Massachusetts’ “likely” voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Center for Political Research.
Thirty-two percent support their candidacy.
The poll revealed superior support for a candidacy by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favor of a potential candidacy and 48% against.
Other prominent Democratic Party names debated over a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin’s post-traumatic stress at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq following his enlistment in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident.
“What my own son is going through, what’s going through after he’s back, I can identify with the other families who feel the ramifications of the post-traumatic stress and some of the wounds our soldiers actually come back with,” he told the audience at a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the detention "the elephant in the room" and stated that his son and other veterans "come back a little different, come back hardened, come back asking if there is that respect for what his fellow soldiers and airmen, and all the other members of the armed forces, have given to the country."
Track Palin was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman and possession of a gun while alcoholic, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are backing a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from all 18 states and the district sent an amicus curiae statement Friday in Washington in support of an asylum seeker who is challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name in the Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner “and their children, members of a violent gang,” abused her, but U.S. officials turned down her asylum application on July 20.
The complainant was arrested in Texas.
Public ministries supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of asylum seekers in the U.S., as nations facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Council on Immigrant Resources that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all applications for asylum be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances underlying them; this prohibition violates this principle,” the amicus curiae statement reads.
Lawyers also argued in this statement that the police ban on immigrants’ entry negatively affects the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “available the necessary labor.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs in June.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their country due to persecution or fears based on ethnicity, religion, nationality or belonging to a specific social group or with a certain political opinion,” Sessions said in his policy announcement on June 11.
Asylum has never been intended to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in a time trial to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
“The environment is very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, 35, the mother of a febrile male baby, as she comforted him at an evacuation center in the shattered city of Palu.
“Every minute, an ambulance brings more bodies.
There is a shortage of clean water.”
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes to try to save everything they could find among their water-soaked belongings.
There were hundreds of injuries and the hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, such as Dwi Haris, who fractured the ribs and shoulder, rested outside Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated abroad due to the strong aftershocks that continued.
His eyes were bathed in tears as he reported how he felt when the violent earthquake shook him in the fifth-floor hotel room where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time for us to save ourselves.
I got stuck in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife cry for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of “Intimidation” with “Propaganda Ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred on Wednesday to China Daily’s paid supplement to the Des Moines Register, Iowa’s most widely circulated newspaper, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 congressional elections, an accusation denied by China.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked the beginning of what U.S. officials, in statements to Reuters, designated as a new phase in Washington’s growing campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently waging an increasingly intense trade war that has seen both sides apply tariff waves on imports from the other.
China’s retaliatory tariffs in the early stages of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states that support Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts say.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an op-ed in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “is now setting foot in the accelerator of this intimidation with the publication of propaganda ads in our free press.”
“With the spread of this propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America’s cherished tradition of free speech and press by publishing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad said.
“In contrast, in the booths here in Beijing, we find very few dissenting voices and we will never see a true reflection of the disparity of opinion that the Chinese may have about their country’s worrisome economic trajectory, as the media are under the firm control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers has declined the offer to publish" his article, although he did not mention which one.
Republicans alienate female voters ahead of midterm elections over Kavanaugh disaster, analysts warn
At a time when many top Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that this could elicit a negative reaction, particularly from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions around the case have been very strong and most Republicans have already publicly stated that they intend to move forward to a vote.
These things have no setback,” he told The Hill Grant Reeher, a political science professor at the University of Syracuse’s Maxwell School, in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that last-minute pressure from Sen. Jeff Flake for an FBI investigation is enough to appease outraged voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow or in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is at the door!” as they demonstrated in the Senate atrium, given that Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee chose to move forward with Kavanaugh’s nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will break all records," Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst with no party affiliation, told the news website.
“People say it’s already tall; it’s true.
But it may be even higher, particularly among undecided voters in suburban areas and younger voters, ages 18 to 29, who, while they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony describing his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that a negative reaction could occur if Republicans moved forward with confirmation.
“This has become a mess for the Republican Party,” Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote, or whether Kavanaugh will take over as a judge, it’s also about how Republicans handled the matter and how they handled it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans appear to be somewhat divided about who to believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority aligning with the first.
A new YouGov poll revealed that 41 percent of respondents believed in Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh had likely or absolutely lied in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake’s proposal, the FBI began an investigation into Ford’s allegations as well as another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford said under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had sexually molested her as an alcoholic when she was 17.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals when the two attended a party during their time at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web intends to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, has created a startup that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary tech persona, Inrupt, is a company that leverages Berners-Lee’s open source platform, Solid.
This allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly stated that Inrupt’s underlying intention is to “dominantly dominate the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data warehouse,” or POD.
This may contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
What is unique about personal online data storage is that it is up to the user to decide who has access to what type of information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to John Bruce, is to provide the right resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some internal programmers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology makers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a total change in which all of their business models are turned upside down overnight.
"We're not asking for permission."
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to create commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new Web created with Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on internet neutrality.
Even as he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: A tribute to a cleric decorated with the Victoria Cross in the First Great War
The only clergyman in the Church of England to receive the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a fighter was honored in his hometown after 100 years.
Lt. Col. Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 with the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he received the highest British military honor.
His two grandchildren unfurled a commemorative plaque at a stop in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was “brilliantly symbolic” that the plaque had been presented exactly 100 years after the feat that awarded the award to his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "in a very thick fog and under closed fire with portable weapons and machine guns."
He then ran into the line of fire and, "with the greatest courage", led the line forward before attacking a cannon alone and shooting down three soldiers from the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I could never match, but also a lesson in humility.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, laid a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the bravery of a genuine hero is being demonstrated through the support that will be given by many people."
Mixed martial arts fans woke up all night to see the Bellator 206 instead watch the Peppa Nut
Imagine this: you stay up all night to see the Bellator 206, full of stars, and at the end, you are prevented from seeing the main event.
The San Jose series included 13 matches, with six from the main group, and was being aired live overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At six o’clock in the morning, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for the confrontation, viewers in the UK were astonished when the cover switched to the Peppa Nut.
Some were not impressed after waking up until dawn especially for combat.
A Twitter fan described the move to children’s cartoons as “a kind of bad joke.”
“Government regulation says the content is not suitable for six o’clock in the morning, so they had to switch to another schedule,” said Dave Schwartz, a marketing and communications administrator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Poor Peppa, yes."
Bellator president Scott Coker said the company will adjust its broadcast schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
“I think when I think about repetition, I think we can solve the problem,” Coker said.
“But it’s six in the morning on Sunday there and we won’t be able to resolve it until our time on Sunday, which is Monday at British time.
But we're working on it.
I’m not lying when I say that when the programming changed, there were a lot of messages exchanged and none very nice.
We're trying to fix the problem, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn’t: it was a government problem.
I promise next time it won't happen.
We’ll reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we normally do. We tried to exceed the expectations of the fans and we exaggerated.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt ‘inferior’ to his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but that gave him motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he entered high school that “not everyone is like me.”
In an interview with the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, she said she had spoken out in favor of gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also claimed that becoming a father made him worry less about winning the Olympics.
The show’s longtime regular host, Kirsty Young, took a months off due to illness.
Appearing as an outcast on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "inferior" to everyone else because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
“To this day, this impression of feeling smaller and different has been the real reason that has given me the power and strength to achieve success.”
His goal was to prove he was “someone,” he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they discovered his sexuality sooner or later.
The Olympic bronze double became a prominent LGBT activist and used his participation in this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
According to him, he manifested himself because he felt happy that he could live openly without consequences and intended to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, “took me by surprise.”
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, though he said the age difference was never a problem.
"When we went through so much when we were so young" - his first participation in the Olympics was at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said, it's hard to find anyone the same age who has gone through similar ups and downs.
The couple had a son last June named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "his whole outlook" had changed.
“If they had asked me last year, all that mattered was to win a gold medal,” he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medalist is Robbie.”
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets to the London 2012 games because he wanted to be in the front queue.
"I couldn't tell him you're not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad," he said.
“I was holding him in no hand when he stopped breathing and it was only when he really stopped breathing and died that I finally recognized that he was not invincible,” she said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I was fully aware that it was what I had dreamed of all my life: diving in front of a crowd of compatriots at the Olympics ... there was no better feeling,” he said.
All this was also the inspiration for his first choice of song - Proud, by Heather Small - with which he had identified himself during the preparation for the Olympics, and which still gives him chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m.
Mickelson down on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record for his 47th Ryder Cup match on Saturday, but will have to regain his form to prevent the milestone from symbolizing an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, playing at the biennial event for the 12th time, a record number of appearances, was sent to the bank by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has so often been in the teams of the United States, the five-time winner of the main men’s championships divided the day between the role of supporter and the work in his game on the field, in the hope of rectifying what afflicts him.
Having never kicked straighter even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not ideal for the Le Golf Nacional course, where long rough usually punishes errant kicks.
And if the field alone wasn’t intimidating enough, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, will face precise British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood, winning all four matches for them this week.
If the Americans, with a four-point disadvantage starting the 12 singles games, get off to a good start, Mickelson’s game can prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but not that he could say much more.
“He fully understood the role he had today, he slapped me on the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a respected champion who has given a lot to these teams in the past, and also this week.
I probably hadn't seen him play two games.
I thought about more, but that's how it happened and that's how we thought we'd have to move on.
He wants to be in the game, like everyone else.”
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo’s record for the most games played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never matched the successes of your individual resume.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, though Furyk has said his presence has created some intangible advantages for the team.
“He’s sarcastic, funny and witty, he likes to play with people and he’s a great person to have in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players had fun messing with him this week too, which was fun to see.
He gives a lot more than just playing.”
European Captain Thomas Bjorn Knows His Great Advantage May Disappear in a Nutshell
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that his lazy lead on entering the last singles day of the Ryder Cup can easily become a bumpy ride.
The Dane had his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros retained a five-point lead over the Americans, but crossed the finish line with the narrowest of the margins, winning by 141-2-131-2.
“We always tried to remember that we had a considerable lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but narrowly,” Bjorn said in the picture after watching the 2018 class win 5-3, both on Friday and yesterday, to lead 10-5 at Le Golf National.
So history has shown me and everyone on this team that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow, give your best.
Go in there and do everything right.
This doesn't end until we have the points on the scoreboard.
We have a goal that is to try to win this trophy and that’s where the focus should stay.
I’ve always said I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we’re well aware of who’s on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Delighted by the performance of his players on a tough golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never get ahead of myself in this.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What matters tomorrow is individual performance and that involves a different task.
It’s great to be there with a partner when things go well, but when we’re there on our own, our skills as golfers are tested to the fullest.
This is the message that needs to be conveyed to the players: tomorrow, give your best.
Now they will abandon their partner and he has to go and give the best of himself as well.”
In contrast to Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will seek to have his players perform better individually than as partners, constituting the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have earned three points out of four.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of these big twists on the last day, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before eventually losing when Europe pulled the "Miracle in Medinah" out of the box.
“I remember all the words,” he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, motivated his players to the final day.
“We have 12 important starts tomorrow, but you’d like to get that quick start like what you saw in Brookline and what you saw in Medinah.
When this momentum is directed to one side, the pressure is too great in these middle starts.
We’ve arranged our staff accordingly and ordered the players the way we feel, you know, that we’re going to try magic tomorrow.”
Thomas, on a mission to try to lead the counterattack, faces Rory McIlroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the first half of the order.
“I chose this group of players in this order because I think it covers the entire journey,” Bjorn said of his choices for the singles.
New German warship once again postponed
The latest German navy frigate should have entered service in 2014 to replace Cold War-time warships. However, it will be necessary to wait until at least next year, due to systems prone to breakdown and an exponentially growing cost, according to local media.
The entry into service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the command ship of the brand-new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper citing a military spokesman.
The vessel should have joined the navy in 2014, but disturbing post-delivery problems have undermined the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels that the navy had ordered in 2007 will be used to replace the aged Bremen-class frigates.
It is known that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, as well as a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies such as reducing radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer periods between maintenance, which would allow the most recent frigates to be sent on missions with a maximum duration of two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the continued delays have meant that the state-of-the-art warships, considered as a way for Germany to project power across borders, will be outdated when they enter service, reports Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German navy refused to put it into service, having returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
This was the first time the navy returned a ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cites a series of crucial "hardware and software defects" that would render the warship useless if used on a combat mission.
The shortcomings of the software were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the contingent needed on the oldest Bremen-class frigates.
It was also known that the vessel is excessively heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the navy to install additional functionalities in the future.
The 7000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to have twice the weight of similar-class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the price of the entire project, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that this will have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros, an increase from the 2.2 billion initially budgeted.
The problems plaguing the latest frigates have become particularly important in light of recent warnings that German naval power is weakening.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, leader of the German parliamentary defence committee, acknowledged that the navy is currently running out of ships capable of being used.
The politician claimed that the problem grew exponentially over time as older ships were put out of service without any vessels to replace them.
In the end, he lamented that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates were able to join the navy.
National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
Further investigations are underway at a property in the Scottish Highlands to reveal how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
The results are expected to shed some light on the behavior of these singular flying mammals and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The study, conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common bats and fruit, as well as long-eared chestnuts and Daubenton bats in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations scattered throughout the property to follow bat activities throughout the season.
Mobile studies will also be carried out by NTS staff and volunteers with portable detectors.
Expert analysis of all recordings will assess the frequency of bat calls and what each species is doing.
A habitat map will then be produced to create a detailed picture of their behaviors at the territorial scale.
Rob Dewar, NTS’s conservation adviser, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as grassland creation, as well as how best to maintain forests for bats and associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the UK have declined considerably over the past century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development work that affects dormitories and makes habitat scarce.
Wind turbines and lightning also pose a threat, along with fly-killing papers and some chemical treatments of building materials, in addition to attacks by domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, given their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo locating technique to identify insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the region, takes bats very seriously.
The organization has ten trained specialists who regularly carry out studies, inspections of dormitories and sometimes rescues.
It also created the first reserve in Scotland dedicated exclusively to bats, on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of Scottish bats.
The property’s director, David Thompson, says it’s the ideal territory for them.
“Here in Threave we have an excellent area for bats,” he said.
“We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and all this good habitat.
However, there’s still a lot about bats we don’t know about, so the work we’ve done here and at the other properties will help us know more about what they need to flourish.”
He stressed the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance on the properties, as the unintentional destruction of only one maternity dorm can lead to the death of up to 400 females and young animals, which could eradicate the entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, disturb them or destroy their dormitories.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to participate to help.
“We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we just don’t know how their populations are avenging.”
Ronaldo denies rape charges as his lawyers prepare to sue German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo characterized the allegations of rape against him as “fake news,” claiming that people “want to promote themselves” using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The forward of the Portuguese national team and Juventus was accused of raping an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that he then paid $375,000 to keep the alleged victim silent about the accident, reads Friday's Der Spiegel.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were released, Ronaldo, 33, characterized the reports as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news," the five-ball gold winner told the chamber.
"They want to promote themselves at the expense of my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but that's part of the profession.
I’m a happy man and it’s okay,” the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they characterized as “an inadmissible report of suspicions in the field of privacy,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for moral damages in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the offense, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly violated her on an anal basis, according to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga alleges that Ronaldo got on his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99%" "a good guy", harmed by the "one percent".
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she addressed the police and had photographs of her injuries taken in a hospital, but that she later agreed to enter into an extrajudicial settlement because she felt “terrified by the prospect of retaliation” and was concerned about the possibility of “being publicly humiliated.”
The 34-year-old woman now says she intends to cancel the deal as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid, leaving Manchester United, at the time of the alleged aggression. This summer he moved to the Italian giants Juve in a deal of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK 'would regret forever' losing automakers
Britain would “repent forever” if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said Secretary of Business Greg Clark.
Clark also said Toyota in the UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90 percent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My perspective is that if Britain leaves the EU disorderly at the end of March, we will see production stoppages at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer in Burnaston.
Other carmakers in the UK have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how to operate cross-border transactions, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close its Minis factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what manufacturers claim to be supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is managed on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from both UK and EU suppliers for custom-made cars.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be border disruptions, which the sector says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day’s stock at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would have to stop.
Clark said Theresa May’s “Chequers Plan” for future relations with the EU was “precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks.”
"We want to have the best deal that allows, as I said, not only the current success, but also the opportunity for us to take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today.
“The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers points out that we absolutely need to be able to proceed with what has been a highly successful set of supply chains.”
While it could not give an estimate of downtime, Toyota said that in the long run, the increased costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and could, sooner or later, lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at the Burnaston plant for 24 years and coordinates the Unite union there, said its members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, if they are lost, these jobs will never return.
A government spokesman said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “another week postponed” given there is still no understanding as to whether Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated for the Supreme Court, would have been able to do so, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of legal adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump’s advisers and Russia, and the possible obstruction of justice by the President.
The fact that Trump may be preparing the firing of the deputy attorney general, thus jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of covertly recording conversations with Trump and the possibility of deposing the President through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he went to the White House, with reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would “prefer not to fire” Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid overlap with a Senate Justice Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the final Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary Sarah Sanders took part in Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "The date has not yet been set, it may be this week but it may also be postponed another week, in view of everything that has happened in the Supreme Court.
I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would disagree with such a claim: Sanders hasn’t held a White House press conference since Sept. 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the shortage of press conferences was not due to an aversion to the “stardom” of television reporters, although he said: “I wouldn’t disagree with the fact that they like the lead.”
He then hinted that the direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president does more question-and-answer sessions than any previous president," he said, adding, without gathering evidence: "We've looked at these numbers."
Press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that’s infinitely better than talking to me.
We have tried to do this often and have seen that we have done so in the last few weeks. The fact that they can talk to the President of the United States replaces any press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences, when welcoming foreign representatives.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week the President showed why in New York, appearing in a relaxed and sometimes bizarre way before the journalists present.
Health Minister writes to EU workers at Scottish National Health Service about Brexit fears
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service to express the country’s gratitude and request that they stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent the letter less than six months after the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to pay for applications for resident status for EU citizens working in the country’s decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: “Throughout the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal have continued, with decisions expected this fall.
But the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible no-deal exit scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reaffirm at this time how much I value the contribution of each official, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering head injuries
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering head injuries in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tigers' Mike Organ said.
Tennessee coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before the break.
"He approached the sideline and practically fainted," Reed said.
The technical team and medical staff placed Abercrombie's oxygen in the sideline before laying it on a stretcher and transporting it for further evaluation.
A team representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information yet about the type/severity of the injury" and that the team is trying to find out when it occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, suspended his studies during the first season with the Tennessee State Tigers after an Illinois transfer.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, raising his season total to 18 tackles.
Higher stamp duty will be levied on foreign buyers when they acquire property in the UK
The Conservative Party has announced plans to levy a higher stamp tax on foreign buyers who acquire property in the UK, with additional revenue to be invested in homeless aid.
The move will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract the younger electorate.
The increase in stamp duty will affect buyers who are not taxed in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance hopes to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
A higher stamp tax rate will be levied on foreign buyers who acquire property in the UK, with additional revenue to be invested in homeless relief, Theresa May will announce today.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract the younger electorate, with promises to make housing more affordable and tax higher incomes.
The tax hike will focus on people and businesses who are not taxed in the UK, with additional revenue boosting the government’s campaign to offer a roof over the homeless.
The surcharge – added to the current stamp duty, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for second homes and purchases for rent – could amount to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to raise up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are acquired by non-UK residents, driving up prices and making it difficult for first-time homebuyers to access the market.
Many of the country's prosperous areas - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a stamp tax cut to help young people acquire their first home.
She accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by grabbing unused land, requiring Mrs May to abandon quotas on affordable housing to solve Britain’s “housing woe.”
Mr. Corbyn announced an appealing set of housing reform proposals, including rent controls and an end to evictions “without justification.”
It also wants to give municipalities expanded powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I stated that I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream that living conditions should be improved for each new generation.
And that means solving the problem of our real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not certain that it is as easy to buy homes for people living outside the UK and for foreign companies as it is for resident British workers.
For too many people, the dream of owning their home has become too distant, and the shame of those who sleep in reluctance remains too real.”
Jack Ross: “My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland”
Sunderland coach Jack Ross said his "last ambition" is to become Scotland's top coach.
The 42-year-old Scot has been successful in the challenge of bringing new life to the Northeastern club, currently third in the Premier League, three points ahead of the lead.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding the St. Mirren on their return to the Scottish First Division last season.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player.
But I only got a B internationalization,” Ross told the BBC’s Sportsound.
“I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden with my father and these are some of my best memories.
But this opportunity will only arise if it succeeds in managing clubs.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland coach include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach says he was not afraid to succeed such established names at such a large club after rejecting invitations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, at the moment success is all about ‘Can I take the club back to the Premier League?’
Considering the structure and facilities of the club, his place is undoubtedly in the Premier League.”
“It will not be easy to take the club back, but I will only consider that I was successful here when I reached that goal.”
Ross’s coaching career is only three years old, after a stint as assistant coach of Dumbarton and 15 months on the technical team of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and led St. Mirren from the threat of depromotion to the championship title the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Taking care of Alloa “was a real crossroads,” he recalls.
“I’ve always seen myself more in the role of a coach than in the role of a player.
It seems strange because it went well, I earned a living as a player and had some high moments in my career.
But playing can be very hard.
We face a lot of challenges every week.
I still face them in terms of the stress and pressures of the position, but I feel great as a coach.
I’ve always wanted to train and now that I do, I feel more comfortable than I’ve ever felt in my adult life.”
You can listen to the full interview on Sportound on Radio Scotland on Sunday, September 30, between 12:00 and 13:00 BST.
The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, according to a study.
The summer heat wave filled British pubs, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
The restaurant groups recorded a 2.7% growth in sales in July, but restaurant occupancy declined 4.8%, the statistics show.
Peter Martin of CGA, who compiled the statistics, said: “The continuation of England’s good time and longer-than-expected career in the World Cup has set the standard for June, when pubs recorded a 2.8 percent increase in sales, if repeated in July, but restaurants have experienced a setback.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant sales in June worsened in July.
Pubs and bars with the beverage-based business fared better, with growth more than offsetting the decline in restaurants.
Pubs with the meal-based business also encountered difficulties, though not as dramatic as those of caterers.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink.
In directly managed pubs and bars, beverage sales rose 6.6% over the course of the month, with meals down 3%.
Paul Newman, RSM leisure and catering analyst, said: “These results prolong the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social and sporting events remain the main factors influencing the sales of the food market away from home.
It comes as no surprise that the catering groups continue to face difficulties, although the annual fall in sales of 4.8% is especially damaging when added to the prolongation of the cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not come at a worse time for operators with the business based on meals. Only time will tell if the milder temperatures we know in the month of August will provide the much desired relief."
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launches.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the industry indicator of sales of British pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of more than 9 billion pounds, being recognized as the industry benchmark.
One in five children hides secret social media accounts from their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, has secret social media accounts hidden from their parents and teachers, a study has revealed.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a growth of “fake” pages on Instagram
The news aggravates fears about the publication of content of a sexual nature
Twenty percent of students say they have a “main” account to show their parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – creates social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth of “fake” accounts on the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news aggravates fears about publishing content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of students claimed to have an innocuous “principal” account to show their parents, while simultaneously owning private accounts.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account found that the teen was inciting others to “rape” her.
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent Schools Directors’ Conference (HMC), found that 40% of young people between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, half of which admitted to maintaining private accounts.
HMC Director Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Council at the regulator’s Annual General Assembly.
Doyle is Scotland’s most awarded athlete. President Ian Beattie described the nomination as an excellent opportunity for sport regulators to leverage their extensive experience internationally over the past decade.
“Eilidh is extremely respected throughout the Scottish, British and world athletics community and we are confident that Scottish athletics will have a lot to gain from her presence on the Board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I’m excited to be able to act as the voice of athletes and I look forward to truly contributing to help guide the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200- and 400-meter races at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and a total of four Olympic gold medals, and who is currently a regular commentator on the BBC, has stopped walking after suffering a transient ischemic vascular accident.
As he wrote on Twitter: “I suffered a stroke a month ago today.
I couldn't walk anymore.
Doctors said only time would tell if he could recover and to what extent.
It’s been hard work but I’ve achieved a total recovery, I’ve learned to walk again and I’m already doing agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouragement messages!”
Milk pump ad compares mothers to cows, sharing reviews online
A milk pump company has shared reviews online with an ad that compares nursing mothers to cows on milking.
To mark the launch of what is described as the “first portable silent milk pump,” consumer technology company Elvie has released an ironic ad inspired by music videos to highlight the freedom the new pump gives milk-extracting mothers.
Four mothers dance in a hay-filled cage to the sound of a song that includes verses like, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If you haven't noticed, I don't have tits, these are my breasts."
The chorus goes on, "Pump, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, I'm milking my girls."
However, the announcement posted on the company’s Facebook page generated controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it alleviates the “horrors” of the dairy sector.
“It is a sad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only their babies are stolen from them a few days after they’re born.”

Another commented: “Comprehensively traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise an extraction pump for mothers who can stay with their babies?"
Someone further said, "An advertisement with a huge lack of sensitivity."
Others defended the ad, such as a woman who admitted to finding the song “hilarious.”
“I think the idea is great.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
The extraction made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy but it makes perfect sense.
This product is brilliant,” one of the women wrote.
Another commented: “It’s a fun ad aimed at mothers who extract milk (often in the bathroom or at work) and feel like ‘cows.’
It’s not an ad to praise or judge the dairy sector.”
At the end of the video the group of women reveals that they were dancing with the discreet bombs housed in the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on information that many women who pump milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly inside a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move around, pick up their babies and even leave the house while they extract milk.
Ana Balarin, a partner and Creative Director at Mother, commented: “The Elvie bomb is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between milk-extracting women and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight all the challenges of milk extraction, while presenting in a fun way that people can identify with the incredible sense of freedom provided by the new pump.
It wasn't the first time the Elvie bomb was in the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two paraded on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Discreetly Displaced to Texas Border Camp
The number of detained migrant children has peaked, although the monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to sponsor children.
Traditionally, most “parents” are undocumented immigrants themselves, fearing they will compromise their own possibility of staying in the country by offering to sponsor a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adults integrating their households would have to register their fingerprints, the data being shared with the authorities that regulate immigration.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Service, testified before Congress that the service has detained dozens of people who have applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The service later confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no criminal record.
Nearly 80% of sponsors or members of their households are illegal in the country, many of them foreigners with criminal records.
So we will continue to persecute these individuals,” Mr. Albence said.
In an effort to speed up the processing of children, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within one month of the date of detention, rather than 60 days, the previous rule, according to foster care officials.
Many are present by videoconference, not in person, to defend their application for legal status before an immigration court judge.
Those considered ineligible for assistance will be promptly deported.
The longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which can lead to attacks of violence or escape attempts, according to reception center officials and reports produced by the system in recent months.
Immigrant rights advocates say these concerns are exacerbated in larger facilities such as those in Tornillo, where the large size contributes to children’s signs of disruption being ignored.
They add that the transfer of the children to the camps without leaving time for their emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends aggravates the trauma that many already struggle with.
Syria demands immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish ‘occupation forces’
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for the return of Syrian refugees home, despite the war in the country being in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would “be treated as such.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, in a war that has left millions more displaced.
He said Damascus would “continue to wage this sacred battle until we liberate all Syrian territories” from both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said conditions for their return were in place, accusing “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational fears” that led the refugees to stay abroad.
“We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid to rebuild Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a security zone in Idlib’s last major rebel stronghold has created an opportunity to insist on political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement established “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including Al-Qaeda-associated Al-Nusra Front fighters, who would “be eradicated.”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria, setting the stage for elections.
Moualem established conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, stating that the panel’s work should be limited “to reviewing the articles of the current constitution” and warning against possible interference.
Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal observers probably expect, the impeachment and scandals end his presidency early.
In what would undoubtedly constitute "the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever"!
At the moment, there are no signs of spectator fatigue.
Since 2014, primetime audiences have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” led cable audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers on big news nights.
“This is a strong draw for people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, producer of ABC’s “Designated Survivor,” about a chief of staff who becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
In Scovell, a veteran comedian and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club" has another theory.
He once called a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
He replied, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell told me.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike television programs, stories from Washington could determine the future of abortion legislation, the right to family reunification of immigrants, and the health of the global economy.
Changing the program is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can indulge in.
And yet, it’s more than just being an informed citizen when we’re watching the sixth hour of an expert debate about Bob Woodward’s use of “deep-knowledge” sources in his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000-dollar ostrich leather jacket (“a garment filled with insolence,” as the Washington President’s Post noted....
I will never see Super Mario the same way again.
“Part of what he’s done feels like a reality show because he gives us something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” about Trump’s dynamic cast and daily plot twists.
We can't miss an episode or we're left behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week they were 26th on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked in at home, watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He didn’t get off television as Brett Kavanaugh prepared to testify before the Senate Justice Committee, with the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
“I still remember when we were doing all those crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but after all they were right."

Significant external funding in midterm elections to the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th circle of Pennsylvania is experiencing an influx of funding, thanks to a realignment of the constituencies that left two headlines in the race for the same place.
The recent readjustment of suburban Pittsburgh circles has put Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his place in another circle in an extraordinary election last spring, on the run.
Lamb is running against another headline, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th Circle of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps the new 17th Circle.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old circles unconstitutionally favored Republicans.
The race for the 17th circle sparked a tough campaign funding dispute between the financial arms of major parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a tangential victory in the highly contested extraordinary March elections for the 18th constituency of the Pennsylvania Congress.
That position had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the circle by 20 percentage points.
Analysts have given Democrats a slight advantage.
US considered penalizing El Salvador for supporting China, then backing down
Some diplomats stressed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with few protests from Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization from management.
State Department officials have decided to call the leaders of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after "recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan," State Department spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement this month.
But only sanctions were considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug trafficking control, economic aid and development.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial aid and specific visa restrictions, would have severely penalized this Central American country with high unemployment and homicide rates.
As the internal meetings continued, representatives from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on economic security and prosperity, following a similar meeting last year seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear they wanted the conference to move forward, putting aside any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has scheduled an intervention at the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
The three U.S. representatives quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any harsh messages or punishment from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about the internal deliberations under the cover of anonymity.
His reports were corroborated by an external analyst close to the Administration, who also requested anonymity.
Study History
The next bomb to be dropped could be the report by legal adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, about which there is currently substantial evidence in the public domain.
Mueller is reportedly leading his investigation into whether Trump’s campaign has conspired with Russia to attack the election.
Should Congress change hands, Trump will face accountability from that body, while preparing to re-apply to voters and perhaps be tried by his peers.
There are many hypotheses and I do not want to suggest that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable – nor that of his equivalents in Europe.
There are choices we have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, some German officers were prepared to depose Hitler in a coup, as long as the West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We missed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around turning points like this, where the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or stopped.
Americans currently face several of these tipping points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under threat since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the president, speculating on his inability to hold the office.
Rosenstein says the Times news is incorrect.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s newly requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not fair and complete or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we pass these tests, democracy is about to cross a long desert.
But I believe that we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my diplomatic residence.
She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, ordered me to light Sabbath candles on that table with the swastika.
With such an inheritance, how could it not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic ahead of the game with the Vienna Rapid
The Rangers receive the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain with Villarreal earlier this month, will leave them in a good position to qualify in Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making the first game of the season until the two-goal draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers will be able to use this result as a springboard for higher flights.
“It was a point well earned by us because Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We’ve faced the game with a positive mindset and got a point.
Maybe we could have won close to the end but overall, the draw was probably the fairest result.
They were probably better in the first part but we went around and dominated in the second part.
Thursday will be another great European night.
I hope we can get the three points. It will be a difficult game because they got a good result in the last game but, with the support of the public, I am sure that we will do our best to achieve a positive result.
The last year has been very tough, with all my injuries and changes at the club itself, but now there is a good environment.
The team is good and the players are having fun; the training runs well.
I hope we can do our best, forget the past season and achieve success.”
Women Are Losing Sleep Afraid of This Savings-Retirement Account
Despite the fact that survey participants have a clear idea of the type of care they want to receive, few people have spoken to their family members about it.
About half of the individuals surveyed in the Nationwide study reported talking to their spouses about the cost of continuing care.
Only 10% mentioned talking to their children about the same issue.
“People want a family member to take care of themselves, but they’re not having that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, Nationwide’s vice president of life insurance.
Here's how to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family for care if you don’t let them know your wishes in advance.
Work with your consultant and family, discussing where and how to receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor: Your consultant can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your continuing care financing choices may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid policy with monetary valuation to help cover these expenses, or financing using your own savings, as long as you have these amounts available.
Prepare legal documentation: Avoid legal battles.
Appoint a health care attorney, choosing a person you trust to oversee your health care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are prevented from communicating them.
Consider setting up a power of attorney on your finances.
You should select someone you trust to make the financial decisions for you, ensuring that your bills will be paid if you become incapacitated.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent is suffering a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Include this information in a written plan to be prepared.
“It’s not just financial issues at stake, but who are the doctors?” Martin asked.
"What's the medication?
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare that plan."
Man shot multiple times with air pressure in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with air pressure on his way home after a night in the city.
The victim, in her forties, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was hit in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries are not life-threatening and police have asked for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a severe earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, with the death toll expected to rise.
With communications interrupted, rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala region, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicentre of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a region that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The region, with lower administrative status than a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mostly concentrated in Morowali on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian disaster management agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Seismic Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of whom in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami with waves of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, spreading destruction and panic among people who remembered the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time no tsunami occurred, but more than 100 people died buried under the rubble of the buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquakes destroyed thousands of buildings, leaving thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charge
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been detained on assault charges.
Palin, 29, a resident of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in an investigation into domestic violence and resistance to detention, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska police.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is being held in custody at Mat-Su’s pretrial detention center, subject to a $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He was present with the judge on Saturday, declaring himself “obviously innocent,” the station reported.
Palin faces charges for three Class A offenses, meaning he could be sentenced to up to one year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a class B offense, punishable by a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called police to report the alleged attack.
The case is being tried by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in reporting a crime of domestic violence, and possession of a gun under the influence of alcohol, in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veterans' associations after associating her son's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people died in an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut, with the death toll expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake hit the central Sulawesi region, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
They circulate videos on social networks showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Public Prosecutor's Office Calls for Rare Death Penalty for New York Terrorist Attack Suspect
The New York prosecutor's office is seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack that killed eight people in the city - a rare penalty that hasn't been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a truck rented by Home Depot to carry out an attack in October on a bike path on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and “intentionally” inflicted serious injuries, according to the death penalty notification, registered in the South Zone of New York.
Both charges can be punished with the death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal court jury charged Saipov with 22 crimes, including eight counts of murder in the service of organized crime, typically used by the prosecution in organized crime cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “considerable planning and premeditation,” prosecutors said, describing Saipov’s execution as “atrocious, cruel and depraved.”
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
For a decade, the South Zone of New York has not demanded the death penalty for an indictment.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit acts of espionage in favor of the Soviet Union two years earlier, during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not show any remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he had been inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also requested permission to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s defense attorneys, said they were “obviously disappointed” with the prosecution’s decision.
“We think that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt to life imprisonment, with no possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked the accusers not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP Says Nigel Farage Should Lead Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed today to "mobilize the popular army" during a protest at the Conservatives' congress.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should “feel the pressure” from eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May’s MPs suggested he should lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that Britain would have “already left” if Farage were Brexit minister.
But May’s challenge to reconcile her deeply divided co-religionists has been underlined by conservatives who have staged a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The prime minister has struggled to stick to her compromise plan, known as the Chequers Plan, in the face of attacks by Brexit supporters, proponents of permanence and the EU.
The Allies insist that it will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the protests, forcing the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and “chaos”.
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he intended to "end the Plan."
Bone suggested that Farage should have been given responsibilities in negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was responsible, we would have left,” he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: “I will continue to defend Brexit but we should end the Plan.”
Strengthening his opposition to the EU, he declared: “We have not fought in two World Wars to be subservient.
We want to make the laws of our own country.”
Bone has rejected claims that public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and intend to remain is utterly unreasonable.”
Conservative Brexit advocate Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the demonstration, telling reporters: “I’m simply saying: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not approve it, it is unpopular with our own party and with the militants who take the campaigns to the streets and to whom we owe our election.
Drop the Chequers Plan and start listening."
In a message to Mrs May, she added: “Only prime ministers who know how to keep their promises keep their jobs.”
Farage said at the rally that politicians should “feel the pressure” if they are ready to betray the decision taken out of the 2016 referendum.
“This has become a matter of trust between us – the people – and the political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them they’re not going to get away with it.”
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to put pressure on our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit.
We want to mobilize the popular army of this country that has given us the victory on Brexit and that will not rest until we become an independent, proud and self-governing UK.”
However, proponents of permanence marched on Birmingham before organising a two-hour rally in the city center.
A mob of activists pushed banners with the message “Conservatives Against Brexit” after the group’s launch this weekend.
The Labour representative in the House of Lords, Andrew Adonis, criticized the Conservatives for the security issues they faced with a party application at the opening of the congress.
“It is these people who tell us that they will have the computer systems and all the technology prepared for ‘Canada more’, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
It's a complete hoax.
There is no good Brexit,” he concluded.
Warren Plans to “Seriously Consider” Possible Presidential Candidacy
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “seriously weigh her candidacy for president” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a debate in that state on Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Rep. Geoff Diehl, co-mandator of Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been speculated that he could face Trump in 2020.
Saturday’s event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in debate format since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it’s time “for women to go to Washington to fix our government’s problems and that includes a woman in the top spot.”
Detention in connection with the murder of Wayde Sims of the LSU Tigers
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police announced Saturday the arrest of a suspect in the murder of LSU Tigers basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
Police released a video of the shooting on Friday asking for help identifying a man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the Southern University campus in the early hours of Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and eventually died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde defended a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted his presence on the scene, wielding a gun, acknowledging he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish police station.
Sims, a 1.98-meter junior from Baton Rouge, played 32 games and started 10 times last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 recoveries per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title with a victory over Sebastian Vettel following team orders
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that team orders at Mercedes would play a central role in the race.
Leaving pole position, Bottas had a good start and left Hamilton behind by defending his position in the first two corners, allowing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went first in the pits and made Hamilton face the traffic of the end of the platoon, which could have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the pits a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a fierce skirmish, after which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the interior of the free track, at risk of disqualification after a double trajectory correction to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen came out of the last row of the grid and was in seventh place at the end of the first lap, on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then led much of the race, switching tyres too late, which would allow him to be quick in the final part, aiming to overtake Kimi Raikkonen to finish fourth.
He ended up coming to the pits in lap 44 but failed to improve his pace in the last eight laps, which allowed Raikkonen to finish in fourth.
“It’s a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman, letting me overtake him.
The team did an exceptional job, which allowed us to finish in the first two positions,” Hamilton said.
Bad body language
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she would not reveal a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford’s testimony before the Senate Justice Committee, commenting instead that what happens in the Senate shows that people are “bad, malicious and false.”
“Look at the beautiful thing that’s going on in the Senate in the last few days, look at the anger, look at how bad, malicious and fake people are,” Trump said.
“When we see the leaks and the releases and when they say ‘oh, it wasn’t me.
It wasn't me.'
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did the escape leave you?
Do you remember her answer... did you release the document?
Oh, no.
The escape didn’t start from me.”
Well, wait a minute.
The escape came from us... No, it wasn’t us,” she added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with the details of the charges against Kavanaugh sent by Ford in July and the leak occurred in early September, but denied that the leak had left his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t reveal her story,” Feinstein told the Commission, according to The Hill.
"She asked me for confidentiality and I respected her request."
But his denial did not convince the president, who commented during Saturday night's rally: "You know what, that was terrible body language.
Maybe it wasn’t her, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that Democrats would be using the charges in his favor.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
We see the evil, the malice, no matter who they can hit, who they have to step on to take power and control," the president said, according to Mediaite.
First Division: Dundee Stars defeat Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scores two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars redeemed themselves from defeat on Friday in the First Division game against the Belfast Giants, winning the second hand 5-3 on Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants got a two-goal lead with shots from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for the home team before Dwyer put the Giants back in front.
François Bouchard tied for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald secured the team's victory.
It was the third loss of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had scored a turnaround on Friday night in Belfast, defeating Dundee 2-1.
It was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, with the Giants having won the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) following an assist from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford watching Beauvillier increase the lead four minutes later.
In a frenzied first period, Sullivan put the home team back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt provided the tie to Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured the Giants reached the first half in the lead, scoring their second night goal at the end of the first period.
The home team reorganized and Bouchard tied again with a powerful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, securing the win by scoring the team's fifth goal in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who have lost four of the last five games, win Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Dies to Help Hundreds of Passengers Flee Earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been hailed as a hero after he died while ensuring a plane with hundreds of passengers took off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are still missing after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi Island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks continue to ravage the region, leaving many residents buried in the rubble of the city of Palu.
But although his colleagues fled to safety, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to leave his post while the control tower waved violently at Palu’s Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport.
He remained focused to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, would take off safely.
He then jumped from the control tower, facing the imminent collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Indonesian air navigation agency spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News reported.
We sent a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to evacuate him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We were devastated by this news,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, noting the country’s disaster management agency that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance is increasing, as there are many bodies buried in the rubble that we have not yet been able to rescue," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves of up to six meters have devastated Palu, where a mass funeral is held on Sunday.
Commercial and military aircraft are transporting aid and supplies to the site.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute ambulances arrive with bodies.
Lack of drinking water.
Minimarkets are being plundered everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a race against time to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we’re going to find.
The current situation is really tragic, but it could have been much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday, according to CNN sources, addressing military forces on the scene and saying:
"I ask you to work day and night to complete the evacuation operations. Are you ready?"
Earlier this year, the island of Lombok in Indonesia was hit by earthquakes that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini Reports Missing Man After Plane Crash in Lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, Pacific, now reports that there is a missing man after reporting that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely rescued from the sinking plane.
In a statement, Air Niugini said it had not been able to confirm the whereabouts of a male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The area company said it was working with hospitals, investigators and local authorities to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local vessels helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said six passengers remained hospitalized on Saturday, all with a stable medical condition.
It is not yet clear what was the cause of the crash or the exact sequence of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy were unanimous in claiming that the plane failed to reach the runway and fell asleep in the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought the plane had gone off track.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was coming too low.
“It was the best thing that ever happened,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others had managed to drag the water around his waist and reach the plane’s sinking emergency exits.
He said the flight attendants had panicked and started screaming, and that he had suffered a small head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, sailors who were working on an improvement work at a nearby dock also assisted in the rescue by turning to an inflatable boat to transport people ashore before the plane sank 30 meters (100 feet) deep.
Based on data collected by the Aviation Safety Network, over the past two decades, 111 people have died in crashes with PNG-registered airlines, but none involved Air Niugini.
An analyst explains the chronology of the events of the night a woman was burned alive
The indictment concluded its allegations Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowllet, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used his cell phone records to reconstruct the movements of 20-year-old defendant Quintom Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber on the night of his death.
According to the Clarion Ledger newspaper, Rowlett claimed to have obtained location data from several phones confirming that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting the statements he had previously made.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he had not been in town that day.
When the prosecution asked him if Tellis was telling the truth by saying he was in his van that night, Sanford replied that he was lying because the van was in Nashville.
Another incongruity in Tellis' testimony pointed to the fact that he had claimed to have known Chambers about two weeks ago when she died.
Cell phone records indicated they only knew each other a week ago.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' SMS messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense is expected to begin filing its final claims on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would begin to be reviewed by the jury at the end of that day.
The High Breed: What is conscientious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to change the negative tone of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
Bristol’s The High Breed claims that hip hop has strayed from its roots of political orientation and social criticism.
They want to return to these roots and return the popularity to conscientious hip hop.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent revival in the UK thanks to the intervention of other performers such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York lover sues couple for firing via 'racist' text message
A New York City housekeeper is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she mistakenly received a text message from her mother complaining that she was “another black woman.”
The couple denied the accusations of racism, saying the lawsuit was an act of “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, showed some fear when she discovered that new lover Giselle Maurice was black when she performed for her first day of work in 2016.
"I CAN'T BELIEVE... NO MORE A BLACK," Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in an SMS message.
However, instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice...twice.
According to the New York Post, when she realized her blunder, an "embarrassed" Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman fired Giselle Maurice claiming the poor performance of her previous African-American babysitter and that she was expecting a Filipino babysitter.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her only day of work and sent home by Uber.
Now, Giselle Maurice is suing the couple and seeking $350/day in dismissal compensation for the six-month period for which she had been chosen without a contract.
“I want to show them that they cannot go unpunished,” he told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know this is discrimination.”
The couple refuted the racism allegations, saying firing Giselle was perfectly logical given that they feared they could not trust her after they had offended her.
“My wife sent him something that I didn’t really mean.
It's not racist.
We are not racist people,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
"Would your children trust someone they had mistreated, even if by mistake?
Your newborn son?
I can't believe it."
Nicknamed the process “extortion,” Plasco said his wife had been a mother just two months ago and had to deal with “a very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to chase someone like that?
It’s not very nice,” added the investment banker.
As the legal process proceeds, the court of public opinion has been quick to condemn the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and reasoning.
New letter reveals Paddington publishers feared readers might not identify with a talking bear
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who first read it before it was published.
It’s so much fun to hear that now, after Paddington’s been so successful.”
He said his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired by a small play bear to write the children’s book, would not have taken it to heart if the book had been rejected, adding that the publication’s 60th anniversary had a bittersweet taste given his passing last year.
About Paddington, who he described as “a very important member of our family,” he said his father was very proud of the success he achieved.
“He was a modest man and not a person given to bigotry,” he said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a successful son: we’re proud even when it’s not ours.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Despite being the result of his imagination, he always credited Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on my phone.
Shortly after landing, her daughter had been rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
"Nad would often call to say that the situation was really bad and that there was no chance of survival," Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“So Nad called to say she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
Together.
The medications the doctors had given her to keep her heart functioning were slowly failing and leaving her system.
He had been dead for some time, and all his organs were dying.
I had to stand there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t scream or mourn because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to restrain myself."
Finally, Ms. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers unaware of the ordeal she was going through.
"Nobody knew," he said.
“I always cried with my head down.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt enormous compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women in mourning post bridge cards to avoid suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide struggle to prevent others from following the same path.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a Welsh bridge with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can use to get support.
Tyler, the son of Sharon Davis, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want any parent to have to feel what I feel every day,” she said.
Sharon Davis, a 45-year-old Lydney resident, said the son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
“He was known for his smile.
Everyone said it would light up the room.”
However, he gave up work before he died because he had “dived into darkness.”
In 2014, Tyler was found dead by his 11-year-old brother.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always worried about a possible repercussion."
Sharon Davis created the postcards "so they know that there are people who are available to help and who they can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't shut yourselves up. You have to talk."
Kelly Humphreys, a longtime friend of Sharon Davis, lost her 15-year-old partner Mark shortly after her mother-in-law’s death.
“I didn’t say I was sad or depressed,” he said.
A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day, there was a rag, and when the kids opened the presents, he didn't even look at them.
He said his death traumatized them a lot, but it's something they have to overcome: "Cast a family apart.
No one is indifferent.
But we all have to keep living and fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake with the start of the FBI investigation
“I thought that if we were to look like what he had asked for – an investigation with a defined timeframe and scope – we could get closer together,” Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the commission was “falling apart” in the face of a deep-rooted party standoff.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
His reluctance is a purely temporal matter.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, and on November 6, if, as expected, Republicans have poor results, they will see their attempts to elect their candidate to the Supreme Court frustrated.
George W. Bush has contacted senators to pressure them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and through whom he met the woman Ashley, Bush’s personal secretary at the time.
What happens after the FBI releases your report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is not certain that Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast the tiebreaker vote and confirm his place in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of defectors drops during Kim's rule
According to a South Korean lawmaker, the number of North Korean defectors to North Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un’s rise to power seven years ago.
Citing data from South Korea’s Unification Ministry, Park Byeong-seug indicated that there were 1,127 defections last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as smugglers asking for more money, were the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public statement.
As a general rule, South Korean citizenship is granted to the vast majority of North Korean defectors.
Seoul said more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal immigrants and not refugees, and they are often repatriated.
Relations between North and South Korea (technically still at war) have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss denuclearization negotiations that are at an impasse.
The talks came after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, broadly speaking, to collaborate in the creation of a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the U.S. for the lack of progress.
“Without trust in the U.S., there will be no trust in our national security, and under these circumstances it is impossible for us to take the first steps toward unilateral disarmament,” Ri said in a speech at the United Nations Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is hysterical and unfit to serve in Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was hysterical and temperamentally unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview given Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if a woman had behaved like that, she would soon be called hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all allegations of sexual abuse to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh made a statement of emotional openness, sometimes in a shrill and crisp voice, as he spoke about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly accused the Democrats of the commission, calling the allegations against him “murder of grotesque and conspiratorial character” organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said he believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves he is unable to serve in the Supreme Court given his biased behavior against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with his statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
When asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh's effective nomination and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
“What I can say is that if you lie to Congress or the FBI, you don’t qualify to be in the Supreme Court, not even to serve in your current courtroom,” Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge in the District Court of D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she feared Kavanaugh's potential opinions against the Affordable Care Act (better known as Obamacare) or the Roe vs. Wade case, given the reputation of being a conservative judge.
During confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh circumvented questions about the possibility of revoking certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not a time to elect someone hysterical and prejudiced to the Supreme Court and hope that we will be happy with the decision,” Pelosi said.
Women need to be able to control their emotions.
It's a justified diatribe, months and years of rage to overflow, and it can't vent without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, do you?"
A woman in an executive position at some company helped me a lot. She told me that I was also crying when I was angry, but I had created a technique. When I got angry and started crying, she would say to the person I was talking to, "Don't think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And it went on.
And I thought to myself... it's brilliant," continued Ms. Steinem.
Tears are accepted when they express anger because, in a more common context, they are misunderstood.
I remember perfectly well, in an old job in a male-dominated office where I cried inexpressibly, being grabbed by the neck of an older woman – an unfriendly manager who terrified me a little – and literally dragged up the stairs to hear her say:
"Never let them see you crying."
“They don’t know if you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be pleased they’ve been able to affect you.”
Patricia Schroeder, a former Colorado Democratic congressman, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Gary Hart was caught in an extramarital relationship aboard a boat called Monkey Business and gave up the candidacy, an extremely frustrated Patricia Schroeder didn't see why she couldn't run for president herself.
“It wasn’t a very thoughtful decision,” he told me to laugh 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates and one more was simply unnecessary.
There was someone who dubbed the situation "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Given his late entry, fundraising was short of desirable and he swore he would only enter the race if he managed to raise $2 million.
A battle doomed to defeat.
He found that some of his supporters would only give him $250, even though they had given $1,000 to male candidates.
“Do you think I’m entitled to a discount?” he asked.
When she announced she was not going to go into a formal campaign, emotions came to the top – gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with a system that raises so many obstacles to fundraising and getting the message out to voters instead of delegates, and anger against sexism – and tears came up.
“It even seemed like she was depressed,” recalled Patricia Schroeder as she spoke of the media’s reaction.
“I would have thought that Kleenex was my business sponsor.
What would you write in my epitaph?
"Did she cry?"
How the U.S.-China Trade War Could Be Beneficial to Beijing
The first salvage of the U.S.-China trade war was deafening, and while the end of the conflict is not in sight, from the perspective of experts, the removal of the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run.
U.S. President Donald Trump triggered the first warning earlier this year to tax major Chinese imports that include solar panels, steel and aluminum.
This week was the scene of a significant worsening of the situation with the new rates affecting goods worth 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds), taxing in reality half of all goods shipped from China to the U.S.
Beijing has always retaliated in the same currency, recently raising rates from 5 to 10 percent for US goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to follow in the footsteps of the U.S. and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to waver in the near future.
Removing Washington would mean succumbing to demands, but showing public subservience to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes good use of its assets, the pressures imposed by the trade war with the U.S. could positively sustain China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“Actually, the fact that an untimely political decision by Washington or Beijing could result in an economic crisis in both countries is far more dangerous than observers could ever have anticipated,” said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher at the Center for New American Security.
Foreign Minister Says Syria is Ready for Refugees to Return
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding a country devastated by more than seven long years of war.
In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by the terrorists to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees who have left the country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people who have remained in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would gladly receive help for the reconstruction of the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or help from the countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team beats the U.S. and wins the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The U.S. has now racked up six consecutive defeats on European soil since last winning the Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe is crowned victorious again after Danish captain Thomas Bjorn’s team reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who proved to have serious difficulties throughout almost the entire tournament, threw the starting tee into the water in hole 16, par 3, giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has shined in all his rounds, becoming 1 of 4 players to get 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 to the lowest-ranked player in the European national team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world’s highest ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to England’s Ian Poulter in what may have been his last Ryder Cup appearance.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most awarded European of all tournaments with 25.5 career points.
“It’s not my habit to cry, but today I couldn’t help myself.
It's been a tough year.
I can't help but thank Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad we won the cup.
It was all a team effort and I’m happy to have been able to help,” said an emotional Garcia after Europe’s victory.
He gives the floor to his compatriot Jon Rham who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods by 2&1 in singles on Sunday.
“It’s impossible to describe the pride I feel in defeating Tiger Woods, and I grew up to see him play,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods has lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
Unusual statistical values of one of the greatest players of all time with 14 great titles won and only beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who had a high-caliber performance throughout the tournament, the rest of the U.S. team struggled to get to the fairway.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance. "I'm proud of them. They fought.
This morning, we managed to put some fear in Europe.
We fought.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players were excellent.
We will reorganize and I will collaborate with PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission to move forward.
I like many of these 12 players and I’m proud to be their captain.
I have to take my hat off to the other team.
They were better."
Up-to-date information on the Red Tide: concentrations decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
According to new information from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, there has been a decrease in concentrations of red tide in some areas of Tampa Bay.
The FWC reported that conditions of lower spot proliferation have been identified in the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties areas, suggesting a decrease in concentrations.
The Red Tide patch stretches about 201 km along the coast, from Pinellas County in the north to Lee County in the south.
Spots can be found about 16 km off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in fewer areas than last week.
The Red Tide was also spotted in Pasco County.
Last week, there were average concentrations off the coast of Pinella County, low to high concentrations off the coast of Hillsborough County, background to high concentrations in Manatee County, background to high concentrations off the coast of Sarasota County, background to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, background to high concentrations off the coast of Collier County, and background to low concentrations off the coast of Le Collier County.
There continue to be reports of respiratory irritations in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
Last week, there were no reports of respiratory irritations in northwest Florida.
