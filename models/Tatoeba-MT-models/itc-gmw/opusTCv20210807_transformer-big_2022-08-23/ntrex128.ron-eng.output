Members of the National Assembly of Wales are concerned that they might give the impression that they are “marionettes”
Several members of the National Assembly of Wales are dismayed because they have been suggested to change their title, namely to be called MWP (Members of the Parliament of Wales).
This problem was caused by plans to change the name of the assembly in the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Welsh National Assembly on the political scene fear this would cause ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party in the National Assembly of Wales is concerned that he is "rimming with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, "twp" means "obtuz" and "pwp" means "feces".
A member of the Welsh Party in the National Assembly of Wales said the group "is not delighted" and suggested alternatives.
A Conservative Party member said the group had an "open" attitude toward changing the name, but also noticed that "MWP" resembled "Muppet".
In this context, the letter “w” is pronounced in Wales as well as the English letter “u” spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently preparing legislation to introduce name change, said: “The final decision on how the members of the Assembly are appointed will certainly depend on the members themselves.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Assembly the opportunity to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which revealed that many of them want to use the "Wales Parliament".
As for the title of the members of the National Assembly of Wales, the Commission preferred "Members of the Parliament of Wales" or "WMP", but the "MWP" option received the most votes in the public consultation.
It seems that members of the National Assembly of Wales have suggested alternative options, but the attempt to reach a consensus could give way to Elin Jones, the chairman of the governing committee, who is expected to send the bill on the changes within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes in the way the assembly operates, including rules on disqualification of members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly shall have the final say in their title when the law is debated.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
This Sunday, citizens with the right to vote will express their opinion on the change of the name of their country to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was held to settle a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The government in Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim on its territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia’s accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a vehement opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not consider the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is only a compromise that will allow him to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin’s Episcopal Church have stopped beating as a result of the problems facing churches in Harlem.
“Historically, the veterans of the place I was talking to told me that before, you’d find a bar and a church on every street corner,” Adams said.
“Today, there are no more bars or churches.”
He also said that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
“People are socializing differently these days,” he said.
“Bars no longer serve as a living room for the entire neighborhood, where people typically gather.”
And as far as churches are concerned, he is concerned that money from the sale of goods will be spent faster than leaders expect and that, “sooner or later, the outcome will be the same.”
He added that churches could be replaced by residential buildings with condominiums full of people who would not support the neighborhood's remaining sanctuaries.
“The overwhelming majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “therefore, this will accelerate the closure of churches, as it is unlikely that many of the people who move into these condominiums will become members of those churches.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a metropolis of African Americans – the St. Martin Metropolitan Community in 1870, a decade ago.
The original Methodist congregation of white people moved from the area after 1930.
A congregation of African-Americans, carrying out their religious activities nearby, took over the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a congregation of African-Americans led by Rev. John Howard Johnson, who boycotted merchants on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who opposed hiring or promoting African-Americans.
A fire that occurred in 1939 greatly affected the building, but Father Johnson's parents made plans to rebuild it and included carillon in them.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin's Church, called the carillon "the bells of poor people."
The expert who commissioned the carillon in July described it differently: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also said it was the first carillon in the world to be performed by an African-American musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who switched to a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said it was not replaced at St. Martin.
What was heard from St. Martin in recent months was a complicated story that included architects and contractors, some brought by deacons of the church, others by the episcopal diocese.
The Sacristy, the governing body of the parish, made up of deacons, wrote to the diocese in July to complain that the diocese would "try to pass the costs" to the sacristy, even if it was not involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some of the parishioners complained about the lack of transparency shown by the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old boy trying to catch lobster in California
Authorities said on Saturday a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was swimming, trying to catch lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place around 7 a.m. near the Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been swimming with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy crying for help and then moved with a group that helped him get him out of the water.
Hammel also said that he initially thought the boy was thrilled that he had caught a lobster, but then realized that he was shouting "He bit me!
It bit me!”
The whole collarbone was torn, Hammel said he noticed when he reached the boy.
“I shouted to everyone in the water and told them to come out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” Hammel said.
The boy was taken by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is not known.
The lifeguard, Captain Larry Giles, told a news conference that a shark was observed in the area a few weeks ago, but it was concluded that it is not a species of shark that poses a danger.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma to the upper part of the trunk.
Authorities have restricted access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety reasons.
Giles also noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury Retailer Plans to Strengthen Its Position in the UK Beauty and Fashion Market
Sainsbury takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, providing beauty products in the style of a universal store with specialized sales assistants.
As part of a strengthening of position in the UK beauty products market, worth 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow, although sales of household and fashion products are not up to par, the larger rayons of beauty products will be tested in 11 stores in the country and integrated into several stores in the next year, if proven successful.
The investment in the beauty industry comes as supermarkets are looking for a way to use the space previously intended for televisions, microwaves and household products.
Representatives of retailer Sainsbury said the number of beauty products it offers will double, reaching up to 3,000 products, including, for the first time, brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing games, such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, will also receive more space, with marked areas, similar to those in Boots stores.
The supermarket is also relaunching its range of makeup products, Boutique, which means that most products are intended for vegans, an increasingly common demand among young shoppers.
In addition, the products of French retailer The Fragrance Shop will be included in two stores of the Sainsbury chain for testing purposes, the first being the open last week in Croydon, in the south of London, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the second part of this year.
Online shopping and the tendency to buy smaller amounts of food every day from the nearest grocery store means that supermarkets need to find new ways to motivate people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of retailer Sainsbury, said the outlets will increasingly look like universal stores as supermarket chains try to cope with the fight with the big discount stores, Aldi and Lidl, which offer more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury has included both products from the Argos outlet in hundreds of stores and Habitats since it acquired both chains two years ago, which means it has seen increases in food sales as well as increased profits.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to refresh its pharmaceutical and beauty product compartments has failed.
Sainsbury attempted to merge with Boots in the early 2000s, but negotiations ended after a disagreement over how to divide the revenues of Boots stores in its supermarkets.
The new strategy was conceived after Sainsbury sold its 281-store pharmaceutical business to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
This means Lloyds will play an important role in the plan, adding an extensive range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer of Sainsbury’s retailer, said: “We have transformed the look of our ranges with beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our colleagues, who will be at your disposal to give you advice.
Our range of brands can adapt to all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations make us an extraordinary location to purchase beauty products, revolutionizing the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones Is Angry After Holly Willoughby Withdraws From 11 Million Pound Contract
"Dragons' Den" star Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby withdrew from a ?11 million lifestyle deal with his company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to get involved in their Truly brand project, which includes accessories and household items.
The couple’s company has been compared to the Goop brand owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of “This Morning” announced on Instagram that she would retire.
Holly Willoughby spawned the fury of Peter Jones, the star of “Dragons’ Den,” pulling out of their lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources, Jones was furious when one of the most beloved people on television admitted Tuesday, during a tense meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to 1.5 million pounds, no longer allow her to dedicate herself to their brand, Truly, which includes accessories and objects.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and would have nearly doubled Willoughby’s fortune, worth an estimated 11 million pounds.
After Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he would give up his contract for Truly, Jones left the UK to take refuge in one of his vacation homes.
A source said: “Truly was by far one of Holly’s priorities.
It would be her long-term future for the next two decades.
The decision to retire shocked everyone.
Nobody could believe what happened on Tuesday, there was a little more until the launch.
There is a warehouse full of products at the headquarters in Marlow that are ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of presenter “This Morning”, which is among the best-selling stars in the UK, could bring the company damage in the millions, as a result of investments in products such as pillows and candles, clothing and household items, as well as the possible further delay of the launch.
It can also be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and Dan Baldwin, her husband, have been friends for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby founded the Truly brand with Capp in 2016, and the 52-year-old Jones joined them as director in March.
The couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willoughby will become the M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV’s “I’m A Celebrity.”
A source close to Jones said last night: “We don’t want to comment on his business.”
I was very tough, and then we fell in love.
He made jokes about the criticism he will receive from journalists for making a comment that some would consider “unworthy of a president” and about having such a positive attitude toward the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump take such a big step back?
Trump said in imitation of a “news anchor” voice.
“I didn’t take a step back.”
He said Kim was interested in having another meeting after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was described by Trump as a huge step towards denuclearizing North Korea.
Negotiations on denuclearization have ended.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leaders around the world at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea had not seen an “appropriate response” from the United States on North Korea’s previous disarmament moves.
Instead, he noted that the United States continues to issue sanctions to put pressure on this.
Trump had a more optimistic view in his motivational speech.
"Everything is going well with North Korea," he said.
“We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had had positive results: the end of missile tests, support for the release of hostages and the return of the US military.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to behave like a president, but if I behaved like that, instead of the 10,000 people out there trying to get into this insane arena, there would be around 200 people,” Trump said.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, killing hundreds of people.
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of the island of Lombok has been displaced, it has not been declared a disaster, a necessary condition for triggering relief actions internationally.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have been very clear about not asking for international assistance, so it is a rather difficult situation,” Sumbung said.
Although the Save the Children Foundation is trying to form a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet known whether foreign staff are allowed access to the site.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute to relief efforts.
Given the earthquakes endured by Indonesia constantly, it is unbelievable that the country continues to be insufficiently prepared for the fury of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not often found on other coasts.
It appears that the lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning has been issued, may have contributed to the loss of life.
Even under the best of circumstances, travel between Indonesian islands proves to be challenging.
Natural disasters further complicate this.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has proposed that improving Indonesia’s precarious infrastructure be the focus of his election campaign and has allocated money for roads and railroads.
But the lack of funds has affected Joko’s administration, which will participate in a new election campaign next year.
Joko also faces persistent pressure from Indonesian sectarians as members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands dislocated from their homes as gangs of Christians and Muslims clashed in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other rudimentary weapons.
Video: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool gives savior goal and equals score in the match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with a 89th minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge football stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 yards from the opponent's goal, and his team was led by Chelsea 1-0.
He hit the ball and sent it to the left before giving a shot in the direction of the gate.
The ball reached above that, heading towards the upper right corner of the gate.
Finally, the ball passed by Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped towards it and fell into the gate.
“I just had to try to get to the ideal position, get the ball, and players like Shaq always try to move forward as far as possible, so I tried to get as long as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming and it was enough, I didn’t think much about it, I just picked up the ball further.”
Chelsea drove 1-0 on break after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The blue team forward sent the ball to Mateo Kovacic, then returned to the midfield and ran to the Liverpool midfielder.
Kovacic made a quick one-two move in the middle of the field.
Then he sent the ball to Hazard, who went into the hole.
Hazard overcame the defense and sent the ball into the net, managing to hit it with his left foot and pass player Alisson Becker from Liverpool.
Liverpool will have a match against Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 15:00 at Stadio Sao Paolo in Napoli, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Tsunami deaths in Indonesia reached 832
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami reached 832, according to the National Disaster Agency on Sunday morning.
Several people have been trapped under the ruins of buildings collapsed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that triggered waves of up to 6 meters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has a population of more than 380,000 people, has been covered by the debris caused by the collapse of buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of killing a woman by stabbing.
A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stabbing wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a man suspected of murder was arrested.
Police have asked people in the area who have heard or seen anything related to this subject to come to the police station for statements.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in the early stages, but I appeal to everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and who heard or saw something suspicious contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially the taxi drivers, who have recorded any useful materials with the help of the on-board camera to contact us if they have essential information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed the body belonged to a woman in Birkenhead and was found on a property.
This afternoon, a few people came to the scene who think they know the woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police said they were trying to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews tried to return to his own apartment, but was told by police that no one was allowed into the building.
He was shocked when he found out what had happened.
People living in the building were told it would take a few hours until they were allowed in.
A police officer told a person that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
At the scene, a woman was in tears.
Repeating it all the time “is so terrible!”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were in the perimeter and another one was outside it.
A few police officers were standing on the perimeter, monitoring the apartment block.
Anyone who has information is asked to send a message directly to the police at MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and mention case 247 on September 30.
Cromwell's Statue in Parliament becomes the latest memorial to be affected by the "rewriting of history" altercations
Its removal would represent poetic justice for the Taliban-style destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts by its fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell society described Jeremy Crick’s suggestion as “crazy” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate about removing statues that Oliver Cromwell’s figure outside Westminster Palace would become a target.
The iconoclasm of English civil wars was neither commanded nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps a Christian Cromwell would sacrifice himself for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a testament to the 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe is worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more so at the end of the 19th century than today, as the defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether it is an accurate representation, this is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
But surely the conflict of the mid-17th century led to the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual recognizable figure who represents part of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated."
A Pig Caused the Death of a Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local news agencies.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found dead after a blood-stained artery was cut off near a pig farm in Liupanshui Square in Guizhou province, according to the Sunday editorial of the South China Morning Post.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject pig vaccines into a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining in China’s Qinghai province.
He apparently came with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a neighboring hillside was open.
He said there was a large male pig with blood in its mouth.
Medical examiners confirmed that a pig weighing about 300 kg caused the farmer's death, the report said.
“My cousin’s feet were bloody and bruised,” the cousin, whose surname is “Wu,” told Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance cameras recorded Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
About an hour later, his body was found.
The animal that caused the man’s death did not belong to Yuan, nor did it belong to his cousin.
A market representative told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else, while police gathered evidence from the crime scene.
Yuan’s family and authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, there have been reports of pigs attacking people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, because of a 300-pound pig, a Welsh man was stuck in his tractor until his wife came to scare off the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can trigger such reactions.
“They’re just playing.
They like to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them due respect,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa, which has lost its intensity, will cause torrential rain in the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is losing momentum as it travels to the colder waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring rains that will cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa records wind conditions at a speed of 85 km/h, being a Category 1 hurricane on Sunday at 5 a.m. and was located about 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to arrive in the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depressing zone over the Pacific Ocean has begun to form and is moving eastward toward the western coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula, Monday, in the form of a tropical storm, will begin to push intense tropical humidity from the north to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring rainfall of up to 25 cm in some parts of Mexico.
Then, the tropical humidity that will interact with the depression zone will generate abundant rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
Local rainfall between 3 and 10 cm will cause dangerous rapid flooding, waste streams and possibly landslides in the desert.
Intense tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates of up to 5 and 8 cm per hour in certain areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitations ranging from 5 to 10 cm are expected in the southwestern part, especially in most of Arizona.
Rapid flooding may occur due to rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is not recommended to venture into the desert on foot, given the threat posed by tropical rain.
Heavy rain could cause canyons to turn into violent rivers, and local storms will bring gusts of wind and dust.
The approaching depression will bring torrential rain to areas on California’s southern coast.
Precipitation of almost 2 cm is possible, which could cause minor flows of residues and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the region during the wet season.
Scattered tropical rain will begin approaching Arizona on the second part of Sunday and the first part of Monday, before the rain spreads more on Monday evening and Tuesday.
The intense rainfall will spread to the so-called “four corners” on Tuesday and will persist until Wednesday.
In October, there will be intense temperature changes in the US as the Arctic region becomes colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
On Sunday, there are dramatic differences in temperature in the central area of the United States.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the prolonged heat of the summer will try to form and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to experience a warm early October, with temperatures as high as 27 degrees across extensive areas, from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
On Tuesday, New York City could reach 27 degrees, about 4 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates high chances of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. by the first half of October.
More Than 20 Million People Watched Brett Kavanaugh's Hearing
More than 20 million people followed the press statement backed by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly taking place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
At the same time, the political confrontation continued, with TV stations interrupting Friday’s normal schedule for breaking news: an agreement between Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the allegations.
Ford told the court she was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh harassed her while she was drunk and tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an intense testimony, said he is 100% sure this did not happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people would have watched the hearing on Friday.
The company counted average viewing on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other networks that transmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people watching from the office.
To put this in perspective, this audience is similar to that for a football game in the play-offs or with the Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News Channel, whose op-ed strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, was in front of all channels, averaging 5.69 million viewers during the daily hearing.
ABC ranked second with a viewership of 3.26 million.
According to Nielsen, CBS was followed by 3.1 million people, NBC by 2.94 million, MSNBC by 2.89 million, and CNN by 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was at the center of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning as protesters yelled at him and he tried to climb into an elevator at a Judiciary Committee meeting.
He stared down for a few minutes while people were arguing with him, and everything was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m right here in front of you,” one woman said.
“Do you think he’s telling us the truth?
He was told, “You have power, while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, that he would have more to say at the committee meeting.
Televisions later broadcast the vote live in the Judiciary Committee to advance Kavanaugh's nomination for the Senate vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if the FBI agreed to review the allegations against the nominee the following week, as demanded by minority Democrats.
Flake was largely convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake's decision came after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
Flake's election was an important one, and it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Accuses Criticism of 'Political Games' on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "political games" with Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, attended the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside his front-page photo of the newspaper, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued an attack on his Brexit plan, the so-called Chequers plan, saying the proposal for Britain and the European Union to collect their tariffs from each other was “completely ridiculous.”
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson, Suspected of Killing LSU Player
Police have arrested a suspect in the deadly shooting of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed for a second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released footage of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After Simpson's interrogation, police say he admitted to shooting Wayde dead.
His search was set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The Baton Rouge Office of Forensic Medicine published a preliminary report Friday, saying the death was caused by a shot to the head through the neck.
The department honors the Louisiana police force, the state police forensics lab, Southern University police and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation, which led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the police for “diligence and the pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20.
The 1.98 m tall striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
Last season, he scored, on average, 5.6 points and had 2.6 recoveries.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“This worries me all the time,” Wade said.
A volcano has thrown a column of ash over Mexico City.
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexican citizens to stay away from the volcano after it triggered activity in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center monitors several howls and vibrations.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on car windshields in neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity of the volcano that lies 72 km southeast of the capital, after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Fighting between Catalan police and separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with the gendarmes on the first anniversary of Catalonia’s secession vote, gathering thousands of opposing demonstrators.
A group of masked pro-separatists kept away from gendarmes bombarded them with eggs and powder paint, creating dark dust clouds on the streets that were usually flooded by tourists.
The fight intensified later, with the police using their sticks to control the situation.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted “We don’t forget, we don’t forgive,” while unionist protesters chanted “Long live Spain!”
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in the region that wants to become independent a year after the October 1 referendum was deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters voted overwhelmingly to become independent, although voter turnout was low, and those against secession largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 100 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations in the region, with violent clashes taking place.
Pro-independence groups camped out overnight on Friday evening to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but protesters were forced to choose a new path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, said he had no hope of gaining independence from Catalonia.
“Last year I had some of the best moments of my life.
I watched my parents crying with joy that I could vote, but now we have nothing left to do,” he said.
Despite a vital but tight victory in last year’s regional elections, pro-independence Catalan parties tried to maintain momentum this year, with many of the best-known leaders either in self-exile or detention, awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequently declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone in support of the police, said politicians on both sides had fueled the conflict.
“The situation is becoming more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison since the end of last year, announced that he will run in the European Parliament elections next year.
“As a candidate in the European elections it is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression that we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Several men arrested after entering house by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly entered a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place on Thursday at about 7:30 p.m. in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was caused to the gates and even the building.
It seems that at one time a crossbow was used against the car.
Menga's strike helped Livingston win 1-0 in front of the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston left the Rangers unchallenged, with Steven Gerrard taking his second loss in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's hit proved to make a difference while Gary Holt's team played at the same level as the Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard’s team remains without a victory in the Premier League this season and faces the Hearts leaders, being behind them by eight points next Sunday.
Prior to that, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston remains undefeated in the division for up to six games, with Holt's head coach still feeling the taste of defeat as he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston Misses Chance Against Crude Visitors
Holt's team should have advanced long before they scored, and their guidance caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to penetrate and tried to flutter through the gate space, then Alan Lithgow managed to flutter wide after he slipped in to intercept Craig Halkett's headball.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could make trouble for visitors on free kicks.
And that's how the crucial gap came about.
Rangers accepted a free kick, and Livingston managed an opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborating to care for Menga, who shot and scored from the center of the goal.
At that stage, the Rangers had dominated possession, but faced the host's impenetrable defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not greatly disturbed the rest of the game.
This model continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a defense from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was unsuccessful against Allan McGregor of the Rangers, and Lithgow gave a big shot from another Livingston player.
Diagonal passes continued to come in which Livingston team, but unsuccessfully, and the two penalty requests - after Halkett smashed Glenn Middleton and after a hench - were not accepted.
"Phenomenal game" provided by Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were excellent, without exception, continuing to exceed expectations on an upward trajectory.
Their style of play and team have not changed since returning to the top, but the merits must be bestowed on Holt for the way he coached his team since taking over.
He had so many models to follow.
Captain Halkett was great with excellent organized defense, while Menga challenged Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the game.
But the Rangers weren’t very inspired.
Although they have performed well since being driven by Gerrard, they have not reached the same standards.
The goal passes were unsuccessful, they managed only once to catch the free opponents' gate, and this should be a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the standings.
Joint reactions to Erdogan's visit to Cologne
It was all pink on Saturday (September 29), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at redressing relations between NATO allies.
They are dissatisfied with issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
In this context, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish citizens in the world, outside of Turkey.
Police invoked security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but gathered enough supporters nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, mostly Kurds, have made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him with open arms into the country.
The contradictory protests reflect the division over a visitor considered a hero by some of the Turks in Germany and an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a biker dies after a collision with a car
A cyclist died after a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m.
The car driver stopped, and paramedics showed up at the scene of the accident, but the man died on the scene.
The accident comes just months after another cyclist died in an accident on Childers Street, in which the driver ran away from the scene, which is about a mile from where the accident happened on Saturday.
Metropolitan police said officers were trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Access is restricted in the area, the bus route is diverted, and motorcyclists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Jail: Six Officers Injured in Clash
Six officers inside the prison were injured in a beating at a high-security men's prison, a prison official said.
A fight broke out at HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 9:30 a.m.
Specialized officers have been brought in to deal with the fight, in which eight detainees are involved, isolated in a wing.
Officers were treated on the spot for minor injuries to the patients.
A prison spokesman said: “Specialized prison staff have been asked to assist in dealing with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members received medical care after being injured.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we have very clear rules regarding those responsible who will be transferred to the police and may spend a longer period of time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison governor needed hospital treatment after being attacked by an inmate.
And last year, in October, the officers dealing with the disturbances were called to prison to deal with a very serious situation, the staff being attacked with billiard balls.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City are in danger of being flooded due to Hurricane Rosa (dry areas may enjoy benefits as a result)
A tropical depression is rare in Arizona, but this is likely to happen early next week as the remaining energy resources from Hurricane Rosa will be used in the southwestern desert, posing a risk of rapid flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued rapid flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to have a direct trajectory to Phoenix on Tuesday, and in the second part of Monday will cause precipitation.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix announced in a tweet that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained a state of storm or tropical depression about 320 km away from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was an action hurricane about 60 km away from the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall ranging from 5 to 10 cm, with isolated amounts up to 15 cm in Arizona’s Mogollon Rim.
In other areas of the southwestern desert, including in the middle of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, quantities ranging from 3 to 5 cm will be recorded, with total possible amounts of up to 10 cm in isolated areas.
For regions beyond the risk of rapid flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing, given that the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, in some areas, heavy rain will be beneficial as the southwest faces drought problems.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least severe drought, the second-largest category, according to weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will lead to landslides on Mexico's Baja California Peninsula.
Rosa, who still had hurricane power on Sunday morning, with a wind of up to 136 km per hour, lies 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north by 19 km per hour.
The storm will encounter colder waters in the Pacific and will therefore diminish.
Thus, it is expected to produce landslides in Mexico, with a tropical storm power in the afternoon or Monday evening.
The torrential rains in Mexico could be significant, presenting a high risk of flooding.
“Torrent rains between 8 and 10 cm are expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, and can reach 25 cm,” according to weather.com.
Then, Rosa will head north to Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, passing through Arizona and reaching southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main danger posed by Rosa or her remains is extreme torrential rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the desert in the southwestern United States," a representative of the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to produce sudden floods, which will endanger people’s lives, and bring waste streams into deserts, as well as landslides to mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 04:00.
He was taken to the hospital, where he is in stable condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested last night in the Radstock area, according to police in Avon and Somerset.
The officers asked for help from citizens who could have materials on their mobile phones, respectively, to show up at the police station.
Trump Says Kavanaugh Facing Democratic Party “Dissatisfaction and Anger”
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the merciless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump also said Kavanaugh faced the Democratic Party's "discontent and anger" during his nomination.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified before Congress, vehemently denying Christine Blasey Ford’s claims about sexually harassing her 10 years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her claim.
The president said on Saturday that “the American people saw that day Kavanaugh’s genius, quality and courage.”
“A confirmation vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote for one of the best legal minds of this generation,” he told supporters in West Virginia.
The president has indirectly referred to Kavanaugh’s nomination as he talks about the importance of Republican presence in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our life.
I’m not running, but in a way, I’m running,” he said.
“For this reason, I express my positive opinion everywhere about the candidates that I consider unbelievable.”
Trump said the Democrats are on a mission to “resist and obstruct.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate since Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP assistant told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquake, number rising
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were taken by the huge waves that hit the beaches when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck Indonesia's Sulawesi island, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday at a beach festival in the town of Palu, when six-metre-high waves struck the beach at dusk, taking people by the water and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 degrees.
“When the tsunami threat was issued yesterday, people still saw their beach activities and did not run immediately, thus becoming victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the BNPB disaster mitigation agency, told a news conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami brought with it cars, logs, houses, hitting everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled offshore at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the shore.
He added that some people had to climb trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The photos published by the disaster agency show several buildings and shops destroyed, bridges toppled and collapsed, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the riots continued to rock the town on the coast.
The series of earthquakes was expected in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Agency for Technology Evaluation and Application (BPPT) said the energy emitted by Friday’s powerful earthquake was about 200 times greater than the atomic bomb’s power from Hiroshima in World War II.
The city’s geographic structure, which is at the end of a long, narrow gulf, has likely intensified the scale of the tsunami, he added.
Nugroho described the damage as “extended” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, he said, in addition to the 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the 300-km coast north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the quake's epicenter.
Communications were “completely disrupted, with no information” from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
He added: “This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
On Saturday, the agency was harshly criticized for not informing that a tsunami would hit Palu, although authorities said the waves arrived at the time of the warning.
In social media posts, you can hear a man on the upper floor of a building shouting frantic warnings that the tsunami is approaching to the people on the adjacent street.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the veracity of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that blocked communications in Palu, hampering coordination of rescue efforts by authorities.
The military has begun sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuated people still need food and other basic things.
The city’s airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has planned a visit to the evacuation centers in Palu for Sunday.
Indonesia’s tsunami kills more than 800 people.
The situation is extremely serious.
While the Word Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in the town of Palu, where employees are staying in makeshift shelters in the office yard, they passed through devastating scenes, Doseba said.
He added: “They told me they saw many houses destroyed.”
The situation is very serious.
Even though relief groups began to start disaster relief efforts, some people complained that foreign workers with comprehensive expertise were prevented from traveling to the Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financial resources, material delivery and personnel can only reach the site of a calamity if it is declared a disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“After the government says, ‘Yes, this is a disaster,’ we can start international assistance actions, but nothing has been announced yet.”
After the second night of the earthquake and tsunami on Friday in Palu, friends and families of the missing hoped that their loved ones would be miraculously saved from such a disaster.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled out of a canal.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been in ruins for two days, with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandon, coach of the national paragliding team, coached for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia, two of the missing paragliding pilots.
Other captives at the Roa Roa hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
“Given my experience with paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon told how, hours after news of the Roa Roa hotel crash in the paragliding community, he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to Palu competitors who attended the beach festival.
But there was only one gray tick in his messages, not two blue ticks.
“I think that means the messages weren’t sent,” he said.
A group of thieves stole $26,750 while feeding a Newport on the Levee ATM.
On Friday morning, the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee feeding an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The car driver emptied an ATM from the entertainment complex and was preparing to carry more money, Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man “run away behind the employee Brink” and stole a purse of money to be transported.
According to the statement, witnesses observed several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not mention the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identity is asked to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes stage name to “Ye”
Rapper Kanye West changes his stage name to "Ye".
He tweeted on Saturday about the change: "The individual officially known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been called "Ye" for some time and uses this title as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
This change comes before its appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to release its new album, Yandhi.
It comes to the show in place of singer Ariana Grande, who canceled "for reasons of an emotional nature," the show's producer said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of the current stage name, West previously stated that this word also has religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year as he discussed the album's title with radio host Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m us, it’s us.
It all started with “Kanye”, which means the one, and we reached “Ye”, which is a reflection on our good, bad, unclear things and on the whole.
The album is more of a reflection on who we are as individuals.”
He is one of several rappers who chose to change his stage name.
Sean Combs had countless stage names, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
And a former collaborator of West’s, JAY-Z, changed his name, sometimes with crayon, sometimes without, as well as with large letters.
Mexican president vows not to use military forces against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use the military to repress the Mexican people.”
The troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the market on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when students’ left-wing movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador is committed to supporting young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are drawing young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for AI.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on artificial intelligence research, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and user of artificial intelligence who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several members of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even though the U.S. lacks an official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: it aims to be at the forefront of AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the U.S. and we are looking for the next AI breakthrough,” Lee said.
The doubling of funds could double the chances that the next big achievement in AI will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated the American player Othello, who was the best in the field at the time, and later served as executive director at Microsoft Research and chairman of the Google subsidiary in China.
Lee appreciated previous technology competitions by U.S. governments, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one will be, to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government funding, Lee said.
"It's not China putting academic leaders on the wheels, it's corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired outstanding graduates from universities to work at AI in recent years.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could help the U.S. step up its AI efforts.
“I think that PhD students should be automatically given an AI visa,” he said.
China’s State Council issued a Plan for the Development of the New Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China provides financial support to individuals in academic institutions similar to the way the National Foundation for Science and other governmental organizations provide money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic activity is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence to engage with industry partners and academics, and the White House announced the formation of an AI Selection Board.
This month, the U.S. Army Research Institute (DARPA) announced a $2 billion investment for an initiative called “AI Next.”
NSF is also investing more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
In the meantime, there were no changes in U.S. law aimed at creating a National Security Commission in the field of artificial intelligence.
Macedonians will vote in referendum if they want to change the country's name
On Sunday, Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum if they want the country's name changed to "Northern Macedonia," a change that would settle a decade-old dispute with Greece that opposed its accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which comprises a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the neighboring country represents a claim on its territory and has opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but opposition nationalists say the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slav population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign had raised doubts about the vote, and that the minimum 50% threshold needed to validate the referendum might not be reached.
The question on the ballot in the referendum will be: “Do you agree to join the EU and NATO by accepting the agreement with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a price to be paid by Macedonia, one of the countries that resulted from the breakup of Yugoslavia, in order to be accepted into entities such as the EU and NATO.
“I am here today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia to live free under the umbrella of the European Union, because that means safer lives for all of us,” Olivera Georgijevska, 79, told Skopje.
Although not legally obligatory, quite a few members of parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
In order for the name to be changed, a two-thirds quorum is required in parliament.
The state’s electoral commission said no irregularities were reported until 1:00 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections of 2016 when 66% of the people with the right to vote came to the vote.
“I came to vote for my children and for our place in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter from Skopje, the country’s capital.
On September 30, 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and their son Dushko voted for the referendum on changing Macedonia’s name, which will allow them to join NATO and enter the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small scene and pulled chairs in front of the tents raised by those who would boycott the referendum.
“We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with our heads up, not the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we are not wanted by the name of Macedonia, we can go to other countries, such as China and Russia, and we can become part of the Eurasian Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I think the majority will be in favor of changing the name, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favor of joining NATO and the EU,” Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a result in favor of changing the name would be “confirming our future.”
According to a poll published Monday by the Policy Research Institute, between 30% and 43% of citizens with the right to vote will participate in the referendum, below the required number of participants.
According to another poll conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote for change.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the vote must be 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy since taking over the government in May last year.
Video: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City manages to pass the whole defensive team of Brighton and score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling managed to break through the defence of Brighton and win Manchester City 2-0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
It seemed that Aguero was incredibly easy to score in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian striker received a midfield pass at the start of the sequence.
He moved very quickly among the three defensive players at Brighton, before reaching the freeway.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players from the opposing team.
He managed to get past a defender, and then he overcame several other players at the edge of that Brighton team.
After that, he took a left pass, the ball reaching Sterling.
The English striker sent the ball back to Aguero, who struck the ball with his right foot, avoiding Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a shot to the right of the gate.
"Aguero is facing some foot problems," Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked to him and agreed to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We’re lucky he scored a goal at the time.”
But Sterling is the one who got their initial lead for the Azuls in the Premier League match.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got a deep pass on the Brighton team's territory at that stage.
Then he gave Leroy Sane a pass on his left flank.
Sane dribbled the balloon several times until he sent a pass to Sterling, who sent it toward the gate.
The Azuri attacker hit the ball to the net just before heading off the field.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim at 12:55 a.m. in the group stage at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to wreak havoc in the game against Rockies
With the national team eliminated from the competition in the play-offs, there weren’t many reasons to force another start.
But Scherzer, being extremely competitive, hopes to win Sunday in the game against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still play-offs for the Rockies, who hold an advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies scored at least one unpredictable spot with a 5-2 win against the national team on Friday night, but are still trying to keep their first division title.
“Even if we don’t play for nothing, at least we can enjoy the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team would probably play at the highest level of any point I could face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete under these circumstances?”
The national team has not yet announced the player who will open the match on Sunday, but according to the sources, is inclined to let Scherzer give the first shot in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be in the opening shot of the 34th game, had a warm-up session on Thursday and will throw in normal conditions this Sunday.
The Washington midfielder has an 18-7 score and an ERA of 2.53 and 300 misses in 220 and 2/3 matches this season.
Trump expresses support in West Virginia
The president referred to the Supreme Court’s decision on Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of the Republican presence in the midterm elections.
“All our efforts are at stake in November.
It's five weeks until one of the most important elections in our country.
This is one of the big ones, I don’t run, but I actually run, that’s why I try hard to support the good candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You see this horrific, radical group of democracy, you see what’s happening right now.
And are determined to take back power by using any necessary means, you can see their wickedness.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control, that’s what they want, to have power and control, and we won’t give it.”
He also said the Democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
“And you can see that in the last four days,” he said, describing Democrats as “furious and evil, naughty and lying.”
He referred to Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Democratic Party and who is on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has been heavily vetted by the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document?
Excuse me?
No. Hmm... I... wait a minute – that was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party no longer tolerates people with a different viewpoint.
People who express their opinion are no longer tolerated.
I was not at all surprised that the Momentum activists in my local party supported the censorship motion as far as I am concerned.
After all, I am only one of the members of the Labour Party in Parliament who has been told that they are not welcome, just because we have expressed our opinion.
Joan Ryan, my colleague in Parliament, received similar treatment because she was vehement about anti-Semitism.
As far as I am concerned, the motion of censure was a criticism of me for not agreeing with what Jeremy Corbyn said.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, similar issues, ironically, about which Jeremy also had no common views with previous leaders.
The Labour Party’s Friday meeting in Nottingham East said: “We want our meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For much of the eight-year period as a member of Parliament for the Labour Party, Friday night’s GC meetings were like this.
Unfortunately, today, many meetings are not held this way, and the promise of a “better, gentler” political environment has long been forgotten if it has ever been respected.
It has become increasingly apparent that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on what is accepted by the party leadership.
Things have started to be that way since Jeremy became a leader, when I noticed that some colleagues with whom I had a common vision in terms of politics began to expect to change my thinking and agree with some things that I would previously have disagreed with, including national security or the EU single market.
Every time I speak in public, no matter what I say, there is a wave of abuse on de-socialization networks calling for my removal from the party, denouncing center politics, telling me I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only person facing this.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than my colleagues, because comments about myself tend to be political in nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination shown by my colleagues who face sexual or racist abuse but maintain their level of involvement in this.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that abuse has become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should adopt a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different views within the party, and with each motion of censure or change of the selection rules, the party becomes less and less flexible on this aspect.
“Many people have recommended that I put my head down in the last two years, not be so vocal, and everything is going to be ‘fine’ like that.
But that’s not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago when I was a student, motivated by the fact that the negligence shown by the Thatcher government led to the collapse of my class, I wanted to fight for improved public services for those who need them most, as a local councilor or minister.
I never hid my political views, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can say that my views on politics and issues with which I disagree with the current leadership are unclear.
To the people who supported Friday’s motion, I can only say that, as the country moves towards Brexit, which will affect our local households, businesses and services, I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the only message I want to convey is not to the Momentum group in Nottingham, but to the citizens, whether or not they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to represent you and I promise that no threat of removal from the party or political opportunism will stop me from making the decisions that I consider in your best interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr football team reaches the top of the rankings
Despite the fact that two late attempts somehow influenced the final result, there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win today's highly interactive match in Tennent's Premiership.
He is now in the top of the rankings, being the only team without any defeat of the ten.
In the end, it all boiled down to their better defense, as well as the fact that they took more of the chances, which helped the host team and satisfied coach Peter Murchie.
“We’ve been subjected to several tests throughout our matches so far and we continue to be undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “The merits are bestowed on the Ayr team, they took advantage of the chances more than we do.”
Grant Anderson's 14th minute attempt, transformed by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr an advantage, but a yellow card received by Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was able to join the team, he playing for the Warriors, allowed Melrose to change the score, and Jason Baggot took advantage of an unshakable stunt.
Climo got a penalty for Ayr and, even in the middle of the match, managed to score, and then managed to turn an individual test, and the score was 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started the second half very well, and Patrick Anderson's essay, transformed by Baggot, reduced the margin to five points.
The game was suspended for a few minutes due to Ruaridh Knott's severe injury, which was taken off the field with the plate, and since the restart of the game, Ayr has been unleashed through the attempt of Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
Ayr captain Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and again, Melrose team made the backup player pay with an untransformed attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of a horrific pressure.
However, the host team recovered, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for plastering Climo without a ball, MacPherson managed to score, giving him the advantage of the Ayr team.
Climo transformed the attempt, as he did again near the start of the match, after Kyle Rowe performed a box kick and sent extreme Gregor Henry deep into the host team's fifth attempt.
“Still Game” sitcom star seems ready for new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kiernan, the star of the sitcom "Still Game", seems ready to move into the hospitality industry after learning that he has been appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the BBC’s beloved show, writing the script and playing alongside his longtime partner, comedy actor Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the next series, the ninth, will be their last, and it seems that Kieman is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to information in the official register, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the news, though a source at Scottish Sun suggested Kiernan wants to get involved in the “restaurant development industry.”
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a naval headquarters full of cranes in La Paz.
Public buildings fly the blue flag, like the ocean.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with the motto: “The sea is ours by right.
We have to get it back."
Across Bolivia, which has no outlet to the sea, the memory of a coast lost to Chile in a bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century is still alive – just like the desire to sail back into the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are probably at the highest level in decades, as Bolivia awaits an International Court of Justice ruling on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the necessary momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, looks forward to the outcome with a positive vision,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the ICJ’s decision on big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will give a ruling in favor of Bolivia’s claim and that, after decades of firm talks, Chile is forced to negotiate a sovereign sea exit for Bolivia.
Bolivia’s charismatic president, Evo Morales, who faces a controversial fight for next year’s re-election, also has much to gain from Monday’s decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in favor of Bolivia, and that too little would change if it happened.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands does not have the power to grant Chile its territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the ICJ decision comes just six months after the final pleas were heard indicates that this case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Not only was Bolivia unsuccessful, but the last four years may have turned it back.
“The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
Morales’ belligerent rhetoric weakened any residual Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to have discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making process was unusually fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end the 139 years of disagreements with mutual advantages,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most beloved presidents – used the maritime issue as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he said.
“Decision is an opportunity to see that we have to go through the past.”
North Korea Says Nuclear Disarmament Won't Happen If U.S. Can't Be Trusted
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's foreign minister, said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke about this at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep its promises made at a summit in Singapore with rival leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of restarting diplomatic action on the nuclear threat more than three months after meeting with North Korean President Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said it was an “unreal dream” that continued sanctions and U.S. objections to the declaration regarding the end of the Korean war would ever make the northern territory cede.
Washington is reluctant to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang taking significant disarmament measures first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there are many skeptics who do not believe that Pyongyang has serious intentions to give up the arsenal that the country considers the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
A fashion presentation from Paris showcases the latest trends in hats and will be available in stores soon
If you’re looking for hats to expand your collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, you don’t have to look any further.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne shocked participants at Paris Fashion Week, launching a series of oversized and extravagant hats for their spring-summer 2019 collection.
Non-practical hats took over the Instagram platform this summer, and fashion designers sent eye-stealing creations to the podium.
The piece of resistance of the creation, made by Valentino, was an extravagant hat, beige in color, with a wide, feather-like hem, in which the heads of the models sank.
Other oversized accessories included watermelons adorned with beads, a sorcerer’s hat, and even a pineapple, but they’re not created to protect your head from the cold.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had stitched lips and brought more of the accessory chosen by Hannibal Lecter, not the haute couture fashion.
One of the creations appeared to be a diving gear, having an oxygen tube and glasses, while the other appeared to be a cone with melted ice cream.
And if you want to continue to adopt such a clothing style, with oversized clothing items, you are lucky.
Designers are predicting a return of huge hats in luxury fashion stores.
The oversized hats come back after the appearance of the “La Bomba” hat, the wide-bore straw hat, seen by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The return of the non-practical hat that appeared on all social networks caused the appearance of another oversized creation on the podium, namely straw bags for the beach, with a size as large as the model in the bathing suit that wears it.
The orange raffia bag, with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, was the highlight of Jacquemus’ spring-summer 2019 “La Riviera” collection at Paris Fashion Week
Star stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expected to see oversized hats and beach bags in luxury stores the following summer because the fashion designer had such a strong impact that it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record for academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional exam results, which is supported by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other community efforts.
With over 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide services at the highest level to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for high school and higher education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can conceive and implement a special school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and desired topic of choice within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, your words will reach his mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, the words reach his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we can’t just rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year’s competition, we note that foreign languages are in the top rankings, with the highest rates of promotion in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who have studied foreign languages have obtained a Higher Grade A certificate.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of students obtained a Higher Grade A certificate in Mandarin; also, 72% of those who study German, 69% of those who study French and 63% of those who study Spanish obtained such a certificate.
This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland support languages as vital skills that children and young people will surely need in the future.
Now, languages, as a subject, are held as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curriculums and in other fields.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that for the reasons employers gave for the job struggle, 17% were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, more and more, language skills become imperative for preparing young people for their future careers.
With more job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, having such a skill throughout life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to carry on a conversation, and French was the only two-digit language spoken, 15%.
That’s why investing in language learning is important for children today.
With multiple languages, especially in developing countries, children will be more likely to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach other languages.
A number of schools will focus on more modern classical languages, while others will learn the languages that are considered to be the most important for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be more languages of choice in independent schools, with teachers who are specialized in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and encourage them with the necessary skills to succeed, whatever the future may be.
It cannot be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vital to the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should indeed be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It has to be done (it has to be done).
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening of Sunday's preseason against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he will play remains to be settled.
“There will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would likely play limited minutes.
Following his training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six-game preseason program.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need preseason games to prepare myself,” he said.
Trump Election Time in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump rallies scheduled for the following week, which include stops in places where the electorate favors him, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the confirmation vote for his nominee for the Supreme Court vacancy is temporarily suspended, Trump wants to strengthen support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time will the Trump election in West Virginia take place and where can I watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. East Coast time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s West Virginia election online via the live video feed below on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week’s hearing of Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court candidate who has become tense over allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior, while the Senate’s expected confirmation vote is suspended for a week for the FBI to investigate the allegations.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans, who face tough elections in November, win some ground.
President Trump’s campaign said the role of these five rallies next week is “energizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority held in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Congressional control is so important to his program that the president will travel to as many states as possible before entering the busy campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Scheduled to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight’s rally could draw supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and be featured in the Pittsburgh media,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won the election by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is leading the polls.
“The fact that the president came to try to propel him into polls is not a good sign for Morrisey,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: The US team shows determination and continues to fight to keep the chance for the simple tests that start on Sunday
After three clearly dominated sessions, the Saturday afternoon foursome may have been exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The ever-swinging pendulum of motivation is a concept invented for the sports world, but players really believe in it, especially in competitions like this.
So where is their motivation now?
“They were driving us by six points, now the difference is only four points, so we’re relying on this drop for a bit of motivation,” Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe still has the advantage, of course, with a four-point lead, when there are still twelve points left in the game.
Americans, Spieth says, feel that the game is starting to change in their favor and that there are plenty of grounds for encouragement, the most important of which is the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and have each earned three out of four points.
Spieth sent the balls to the green zone with lethal precision, setting an example for his colleagues.
Those festive guttural screams became louder as the round progressed, especially when he scored a crucial point that brought the score back to equal in the fourth match, after he and Thomas had been driven two points behind the first two holes.
The kick he won the match at 15 was celebrated with a similar scream, a scream that makes you think the American team still has chances.
“You just have to focus and just worry about your own game,” Spieth says.
That’s all that’s left for these players.
18 holes to make a good impression.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed revelation of the Ryder Cup.
The odd but adorable pair of Europeans have won four out of four matches and it seems they can’t fail.
"Moliwood" was the only pair that didn't need any extra hits on Saturday afternoon, but that's true for Saturday morning, and for Friday afternoon, and even for nine points on Friday morning.
This performance and how their energy seems to flow to and from the enthusiastic audience reinforces the view that they will be the most dangerous players on Sunday. No other player would be more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari if they would bring to a successful end a potential victory for Europeans when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
Preferably, both simultaneously, at different holes.
Talks about the glory of Europeans remain premature for now.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly passed Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning at the fourballs, when he paired up with Alex Noren.
An additional shot and two doubles in the first nine holes sank the Spaniard and the Swede into a pit so deep that they were not even close to getting out of it.
On Sunday, however, no one will be safe.
The samples of fourballs and foursomes are fascinating and worth following closely due to the interactions between the pairs, the tips given and undated, and the way a strategy can change on the spot.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and have a significant lead on the final day, but this foursome session also showed that the US team has the motivation to continue the fight, which some, especially those in the United States, doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 on Ryder Cup final day
Europe begins the last day of the Ryder Cup with a significant lead after finishing the Saturday fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the offensive with two victories in front of a hesitant Tiger Woods, raising their score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn’s European team, trying to win back the trophy he lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American players who made many mistakes in the morning fourballs and won the series with the score of 3 to 1.
The U.S. resisted the foursome, where it won two games, but could not reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk’s team needs eight points out of 12 Sunday singles matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four points in a row, and along with Molinari, a pair dubbed “Molliwood” after a sensational weekend, they are the second pair to win four points out of four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they stood up superbly to defeat the discouraged Woods and novice American Bryson Dechambeau with an even clearer score, 5-4.
Woods, who had problems in both games on Saturday, had occasional glimmers of genius, but so far has lost 19 of 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes, many of which were consecutive defeats.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning fourball session, returned with partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka 2-1, positions one and three in the world.
Europe, however, did not have an obstacle-free journey on this pleasant and cool day in the southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three-time major tournament winner, and Justin Thomas became the standard for Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They managed to win 2-1 a match against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs, then came back later and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder's history has a team managed to recover a four-point deficit in the simple trials, although, because they are the current holders of the trophy, Furyk's players only need an equal result.
However, after being in second place two days in a row, a counterattack on Sunday seems unlikely.
North Korea says there is “no chance” to unilaterally disarm as long as there is no trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that prolonging sanctions would deepen distrust in the United States and that it is impossible for his country to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the Global Council’s annual General Assembly that North Korea had implemented “significant steps to prove its good faith” last year, such as halting nuclear testing and missile testing, dismantling the nuclear test site and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see any appropriate response from the United States," he said.
“If we cannot trust the United States, we will not trust our national security capabilities, and in such circumstances, we cannot unilaterally disarm first.”
Although Ri has resumed familiar objections from North Korea to Washington’s resistance to a “misguided” approach to denuclearization that would reward North Korea for taking steps, his statement seemed significant for not directly rejecting unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first-ever summit between a sitting U.S. president and the leader of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to make progress toward a “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump offered guarantees for North Korea’s security.
North Korea sought an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington has failed to comply with calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on the 'denuclearization first' option and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, and even objects to the 'war-ending declaration'," Ri said.
“The impression that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an illusion that only people who don’t know us have.
But the problem is that prolonged sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader referred to at the United Nations earlier this week.
In contrast, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, the president of South Korea, over the past five months, adding: "If the issue of denuclearization had been negotiated with South Korea and not with the US, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this impasse."
Even so, the tone of Ri’s speech was very different from that of last year’s speech when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target the US territory with missiles from North Korea after “Mr. Evil President” Trump named Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who had threatened North Korea with “total destruction” last year, praised Kim for his courage to initiate the disarmament process, but said the work was just beginning and the sanctions would remain valid until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no planned period for this and added: “It doesn’t matter if it takes two or three years or five months.”
China and Russia say Pyongyang should be rewarded by the UN Security Council for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without interruption until we achieve complete, final and confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to block funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was not very successful.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said progress had been made, but only a few hours later, North Korea denounced Pyongyang's "gangster threats".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile launch pad and a nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate action.”
He said Kim told him that the “appropriate measures” he was looking for were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and that he wants a normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses on how to get enough rest
A new Harvard course this year encourages students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture that makes them undergo “all night” learning sessions energized with a lot of caffeine.
A scientist has discovered that often the students of the most prestigious university in the world do not even master the basic concepts of how they should take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, is the one who created the course, which is believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after holding a lecture on the impact of lack of sleep on the ability to learn.
“In the end, a girl came up and said, ‘Why is this being said to me just now, in the last year?’
She told me that she had never been told about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, first introduced this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance as well as overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were seriously sleep deprived during the week.
The one-hour course may involve a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, a picture of a bedroom is presented, and students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports pants, and books to tell them what the effects of caffeine and light are and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deficiency, as well as the importance of a sleep schedule.
In another section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily schedule.
“We know that we can’t instantly change the behavior of students.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as anyone has a right to know the health effects of smoking,” added Professor Czeisler.
The culture that makes students proud to have learned all night still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students have turned sleep deprivation into a growing problem.
Sufficient, good-quality sleep should be a student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid gaining weight because sleep deprivation makes the brain think the body is hungry, which makes students feel like they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler create the course after taking one of his first year courses at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course for all students.
The next step, he hopes, is to require all postgraduate students to complete a similar degree program before enrolling in this institution where competition is fierce.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students schedule an alarm to know when it’s time to go to bed, as well as for the waking time, and to know what are the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LEDs, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and cause difficulties when they try to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks down Gerrard's team
The Rangers suffer from another case of depression on the move as Dolly Menga's hit condemned Steven Gerrard's unconvincing team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to win their first 4-1 win in February against St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team managed to manage Gerrard's second defeat of 18 games as a coach, putting the Rangers eight points behind the Ladbrokes Premiership's authoritarian leaders Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break and the uninspired Rangers never seemed able to match.
The Rangers thus fell to sixth place in the standings, while Livingston climbed to third, behind Hibernian, with a one-goal difference.
And the Rangers may also face other issues, as cough referee Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was apparently thrown out of the turf by fans of the visiting team.
Gerrard switched eight players from the lot that easily won against Ayr in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same 11 Livingstone players who managed to score a match with the Hearts last week and has every reason to be proud of how his well-trained squad choked his opponents over the course of the game.
Even though the Rangers had superior possession, Livingston used more effectively the balls they had.
He should have scored just two minutes after the start of the game, when Menga's first pass propelled Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's defensive gate, but the midfielder missed a very good opportunity.
A deep free kick from Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, sent her to the bar.
The Rangers took control, but left the impression that they hoped more than they trusted their game in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos strongly believed he should have received a penalty when he clashed with Steven Lawless in the fifteenth minute of the game, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's request.
The Rangers only got two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not at all bothered by Coulibaly’s head or Ovie Ejaria’s weak shot.
Although Livingstone's 34th minute goal did not meet the game's trend, no one can deny that it was worth it, either for the effort alone.
Again, the Rangers failed to prevent a deep centering of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield had no reaction when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm and passed it to Menga, who finished with a simple shot.
Gerrard acted on the break, when he traded Ryan Kent for Coulibaly; this move almost paid off immediately, when the extreme centered on Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out of the goals to block him.
But Livingston continued to lure visitors into the exact same type of match they preferred, with Lithgow and Halkett intercepting centering after centering.
Holt's team could have extended their lead into the final stages, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs' hit, then Lithgow threw his head across the corner.
Glenn Middleton, the Rangers reserve, asked for a penalty at the end of the game when he hit the Jacobs but again Thomson disagreed.
Almanah: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from our Sunday morning Almanah: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago (and the count goes on...), is the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger counter.
An essential device for science ever since, the Geiger counter has also become essential for pop culture, as happened in the 1950 film "The Stooges of San Coronado", in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans starred as cowboys with unlikely propensities for science:
Man: “What’s that?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you wear these headsets, you can hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactivity in minerals.”
Evans: “Yes, a lot of shots are heard!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before he turned 63.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Your Immune System to “Detect” Harmful Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Your Immune System to “Detect” and Destroy Harmful Cells
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in a laboratory
They can “detect” a protein common to many cancers and then are re-injected.
A test vaccine provides promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
Ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory so that they can “detect” a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute of Oncology in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we are dealing with a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “determines the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach, to take immune cells out of life and “learn” them to target cancer cells, has also worked to treat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West held a supportive Trump diatribe while wearing a MAGA cap after his appearance at SNL.
It didn't work out too well.
Kanye West was hounded in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a wild performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he planned to run for president in the 2020 election.
After performing his third song, Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great cap, the artist unleashed himself in a speech against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
“Often when I talk to a white person, I’m asked, ‘How can you like Trump?
Well, if I had been worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a scene starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star took Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn’t aired, West’s diatribe footage was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to take West by the way with this post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had problems behind the scenes because of his sting.
“They tried to intimidate me behind the scenes.
They said, “You can’t wear that hat.”
I was assaulted!
They also told me that we got very low,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see how low I got?” and then said, “I’m going to get my Superman mantle, because that means you can’t tell me what to do.
Try it with love.”
His comments drew audiences at least twice, and the members of the SNL team seemed embarrassed, Variety reported; a person from that team told the publication: “There was complete silence in the studio.”
West was invited as a last-minute replacement for Ariana Grande, whose former lover, rapper Mac Miller, passed away a few days ago.
West raised many eyebrows when he performed the song I Love It dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
TPUSA conservative group leader Candace Turner tweeted: “To one of the bravest spirits among us: I thank you for taking the plunge.”
Karen Hunter, the host of a talk show, wrote on Twitter that West simply “was himself and that’s great.”
“But I choose NOT to reward someone (buying music or clothing or supporting ‘art’) who I think embraces and expresses an ideology harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so are we,” she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, announcing that he is now “officially known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name; West follows in the footsteps of Diddy, previously known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, took the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the former music legend, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then into the "artist formerly known as Prince".
Accused of attempted murder for stabbing a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant in Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defense attorney is expected to be heard by the Belfast court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the public prosecutor.
Kit Harington, the Star of Thrones, Attacks Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO-produced violent medieval fantasy series The Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that presenting these roles on screen makes boys think they need to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he found that “something wrong” and wondered how the problem of toxic masculinity could be managed in the ?MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his 31-year-old co-worker Rose Leslie, said he was “very determined” to talk about the issue.
“Personally, I’m very determined to talk about it now: where did I get away with masculinity?” he asked.
“What did we teach men about being like adults, given the problem we’re facing now?”
Kit believes that television could be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity through the very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is learned?
What do young boys on TV and on the street learn, what makes them think they have to be a certain type of man?
I think that’s one of the big questions of our time: how can we change that?
Because it’s clear that something happened to the young people.”
In the interview, he acknowledged that he would not be playing in any of the series based on the Game of Thrones after the series ends next summer, saying that he had “finished with the battlefields and the horses.”
From November, Kit will star in a new production of Sam Shepard’s True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that has happened to him because of the series Ursula dei Troni is that he met his wife, Rose.
“I met my wife when I did this show, so it secured my family’s future and my life from now on,” Kit said.
Rose played Ygritte, the girlfriend of Jon Snow, the character played by Kit in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie’s family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China Reports 14% Increase in New Cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of Chinese citizens suffering from HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by the disease in China, officials say.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted sexually, unlike those in the past.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly in some areas of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials told a conference in Yunnan province.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widely considered.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually end up marrying a woman.
Many of the cases of transmission of diseases come from inadequate sexual protection measures in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of an effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee disclosed Republican Party senators’ data, talks about “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her team posted personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the accusations were made by analysts and “extremely right-wing” websites.
“Lies, lies and other miserable lies,” Waters said in a Twitter post.
The leaked information included the senators' addresses and personal phone numbers, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online Tuesday, posted by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior against Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters’ office and presented the information to a member of Waters’ team, Hill reported.
“These unfounded allegations are completely false, an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The team member, whose identity, personal information and safety were compromised as a result of these false allegations, was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
These unfounded allegations are completely false, an absolute lie.”
Waters' statements were criticized online shortly after they were made, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is furious,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests he doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven’t done, they don’t have to be angry.
It doesn't have to be defiant.
He should not question the defendant’s motives.
You have to be calm and calm.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters’s reaction to that of Judge Kavanaugh, criticized by the Democrats, who said he seemed a little too angry during Tuesday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican running against Waters in the midterm elections, also commented on the situation on Twitter.
“Important, if it’s true,” he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said her office had alerted “appropriate authorities and legal entities to these false allegations.”
“We will make sure the perpetrators are discovered,” she continued, feeling that they will be held accountable to the law for all their destructive and dangerous actions for any of my team members.
Johnny English strikes again: loose parody of spy movies, starring Rowan Atkinson
It has become a tradition to look for meanings associated with Brexit in any new British film, but this does not apply to the new film in the series of parodies of action films that has as main character Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English returning.
Will this sizzling satire of how weird we are become the nation’s new export opportunity?
However, Johnny English, the incompetent spy with staring eyes and a rubber face, was renewed for the second time. The name of the character means, first of all, that it is a general comic creation for the film audience in non-English speaking countries.
He is, of course, the shredded secret agent who, despite his claims to luxury and extravagance, has a bit of Clouseau, a drop of Mr. Bean, and a knife tip of the kind that contributed a single note to the musical theme of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
The character is based on the explorer and mysterious countryless man Atkinson once played in the Barclaycard TV commercials, which left chaos behind him.
This last adventure of JE also has one or two nice moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the rotor blades hit his helmet lightly.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is highlighted, but humor is rather weak and oddly superfluous, especially because "serious" movies such as those in the 007 series or Mission Impossible confidently offer comic moments as an ingredient.
Humor seems to appeal to children more than adults, and for me Johnny English’s haunted adventures aren’t as inventive and intelligent as Atkinson’s silent film gags when he plays Bean.
As usual, the premise has always been that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain’s super-secret spy web and revealed the identities of British undercover agents, to the desperation of the service agent, a regrettablely small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the last drop for a pompous and besieged prime minister already suffering a severe crisis due to declining political popularity: Emma Thompson does everything she can with her Theresa May-like character, but the script doesn’t give her a chance to shine.
Her secret intelligence advisers inform her that all active spies have been compromised, so she must activate an agent in reserve.
This is Johnny English’s own zevzez, now working as a teacher in a top-class school, which also teaches how to be an undercover agent. Here are some cute stooges, because English runs a School of Rock-style spy academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting, then is reunited with his old-time partner, Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a very enthusiastic and precious character, in which Vicki Pepperdine’s talent is a bit wasted.
So all Batman and Robin of the creation of trouble in Her Majesty's Secret Service return to action, facing off against the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletinva, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s IT problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on an odyssey of burlesque adventures: disguised as waitresses, they set fire to a fashionable French restaurant, create chaos when they sneak aboard Volta’s luxury ship, then English unleashes anarchy in pure form when he tries to use a set of glasses for virtual reality to familiarize himself.
The latter is very ambitious, but no matter how cute and colourful the film, it seems like a children’s television production.
A pretty mediocre movie.
As with the other Johnny English movies, I can’t help but wonder: can the British film industry really give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies plans for Britons to work four days a week but get paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party would have a radical plan that the British would only work four days a week, but would be paid for five days.
It seems that the party wants the heads of companies to take advantage of the possible savings due to the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution by giving employees another day off.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but the salary would not change.
The sources say the idea would “match” with the party’s economic program, which wants to tilt the balance in favor of the workers.
The move to the four-day workweek is supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A source from Labour’s leadership told The Sunday Times: “The announcement of a policy review is expected before the end of the year.
It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day work week is a fitting aspiration in the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of the worker, as well as in the party’s overall industry strategy.”
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea; the four-day work week was one of the Green Party’s promises in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day work week is not a party policy and is not taken into account by the party.”
The Lord Chancellor of the Shadow Cabinet, John McDonnell, took advantage of last week’s Labour conference to describe his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from “lifeless executives” and “profitees” from utility firms.
The Lord Chancellor’s plans also refer to the fact that the current shareholders of the water-supplying regions may not recover their shares in full, because the Labour government could collect “deductions” because of crimes found.
It also confirmed plans to appoint workers to the boards of directors of the companies and to create property funds through which 10% of the equity of private sector companies will be transferred to employees, who will thus receive annual dividends of up to about 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy Reveal on '60 Minutes' Whether the FBI's Investigation of Kavanaugh Would Change Their Minds
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his candidacy as a Supreme Court judge by at least a week and raises the question whether Republican senators could be persuaded to stop supporting him because of the FBI’s findings.
In a Sunday interview, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find information that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more willing to do that than his colleague in South Carolina.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said that at the beginning of the hearings; I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when that happened, when the accusations came up, and I asked him, ‘Are you guilty?’
The answer was decided, prompt, unequivocal.”
Graham's vote, however, seems to have been dug into stone.
“I’m determined about Brett Kavanaugh, so there would be some explosive charges,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but this is what I know: Brett resolutely rejects the allegations,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the people she named confirmed the story.
And it happened 36 years ago.
I doubt anything will change.”
What is the Global Citizen’s Festival and has it managed to do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event attended by an impressive group of stars with an equally impressive mission: the elimination of global poverty.
Now in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will draw tens of thousands of people to the Central Park lawn, not only to follow artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of the event, eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), viewers have had to fulfill a number of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, sending emails to world leaders, making phone calls or other significant things that help raise global awareness of the goal of elimination.
But what success did the Global Citizen Festival have when it was only 12 years away to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince them to act, or is it just another case of so-called “clicktivism,” a concept that refers to people who feel they’ve accomplished something by signing a petition online or sending a message on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011 there have been more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, who have promoted different goals.
These actions have pushed global leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group was talking about 390 commitments and announcements caused by its actions, on behalf of which at least $10 billion has already been spent or collected.
The group estimates that the funds insured so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and intermediaries who have pledged to “help children grow to their full potential,” which has pledged to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Twitter messages from global citizens.
“With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition just a footnote in the book of history,” Tracey Ullman, The Power of Nutrition ambassador, told the crowds during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken in the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced it would fund The Power of Nutrition project, which will provide nutrition interventions for 5 million women and children.
The answer to one of the most common questions on their website: “What makes you think you can eliminate extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded: “It’s going to be a long and difficult road, sometimes we’ll fall and we’ll fail.
But like the great civil rights or anti-apartheid movements that took place before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the performers at this year’s New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use naval forces to ‘blockade’ Russia’s energy exports, Interior Secretary says
Washington can, “if necessary,” turn to naval forces to prevent Russian energy from reaching certain markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke argues that Russia’s commitment to Syria, in particular, where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason I’m in the Middle East is because I want to mediate the sale of energy, as I do in Eastern Europe and in the southern part of Europe,” he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and methods to manage the situation.
“The United States has the capacity, through our naval forces, to ensure that sea routes are open and, if necessary, to create a blockade, so that the energy does not come to market,” he said.
Zinke speaks to participants at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that declares itself the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He went on to compare the way Washington interacts with Russia and Iran, showing that the approach is practically the same.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the use and replacement of fuels,” he said, saying Russia “knows a single trick” because of its fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The statements come at a time when the Trump administration is trying to increase liquefied natural gas exports to Europe to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, representatives of the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inadequate” Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which Trump said would turn Berlin into a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin said U.S. fierce opposition to the project is driven by economic motives and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we see things the same way: energy can’t be a tool to put pressure on and consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Aleksandr Novak, Russia’s energy minister, said after a meeting with Rick Perry, the U.S. energy secretary in Moscow in September.
The US position drew criticism from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s main industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem with a third state intervening in energy issues,” Dieter Kempf, president of the German Federation of Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren ‘thinks seriously’ about running for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator says
Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator, said on Saturday she must "consider seriously" whether to run in the presidential election after the midterm elections.
During the town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering a candidacy.
“It’s time for a woman to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that’s what a strong woman is needed,” she said.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider whether to run for president.”
Warren also had something to say about President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting, saying he was “directing the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was a vocal critic of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said “normally we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll published Thursday showed that even most of Warren’s voters don’t think he should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “likely” voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent of respondents support such a bid.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick’s candidacy: 38% of respondents support his potential candidacy and 48% are against it.
Other well-known Democrats who could run in 2020 are Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would formally decide by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin Talks About Track Palin’s Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome at Donald Trump’s Meeting
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged in a domestic violence case.
“The things my own son went through after he came back ... I can understand the suffering of other families who feel the ramifications of post-traumatic stress syndrome and the aftermath of the wounds with which our soldiers return,” he told the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest the "elephant in the room" and said her son and other war veterans "returned a little different, tougher, wondering if there was any respect left for what they and their soldiers in the military and air force, as well as all the other members of the Army, did for the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, preventing reports of domestic violence and possession of a drunken firearm, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia challenge a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims trying to escape gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District filed an amicus curiae application in Washington on Friday to support a policy challenge on asylum seekers, NBC News reports.
The plaintiff's full name in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit that the American Civil Liberties Union initiated in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner "knows his violent sons, members of a gang," abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The state-appointed lawyer representing Grace has described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have produced a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as a nation facing a widespread problem with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Council that allowed undocumented immigrants trying to escape domestic violence to seek asylum.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation.”
“Federal law says that all asylum applications must be judged on the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a limitation violates this principle,” the amicus curiae wrote in the application.
In addition, lawyers argue in the petition that the policy that denies immigrants entry is hurting the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
Jeff Sessions, the U.S. attorney general, in June ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims trying to escape gang abuse and violence.
“Asylee is granted to those who leave their country driven by persecution or fear because of discrimination based on race, religion, nationality or membership in a social group or because of a political opinion,” Sessions said on June 11.
The role of asylum has never been to solve all the problems people face every day in the world, not even all the serious problems.
Desperate rescue operation in Palu, where the number of deaths has doubled, in a race against time to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation has become more and more serious.
“The situation seems very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who is curing her fever-stricken baby at an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
“Ambulances bring bodies all the time.
Drinking water is insufficient.”
Residents began to return to their destroyed homes and organize their flooded goods, trying to save everything that could be saved.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale, were overtaken by the situation.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures to the spine and shoulder, rest outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients are treated outdoors because of the strong and continuous aftershocks.
He has tears in his eyes as he remembers how the violent earthquake shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was caught in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was safe for a wedding.
“I heard my wife crying for help, then just silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and my child.
I hope I'm safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of “abuse” of “propaganda claims”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the U.S. press to distribute propaganda materials.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China’s paid-for supplement in the Des Moines Register, Iowa’s best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of meddling in the Nov. 6 congressional election, a charge that China rejects.
The accusation that Beijing is trying to meddle in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign in Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish commercials promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in a growing trade war that involves waves of tariff increases for imports.
Tariffs imposed by China as revenge at the start of the trade war were created to hurt exporters from states like Iowa, which backed Trump’s Republican Party, experts from China and the US said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businessmen.
In an editorial published Sunday in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote that China “continues this abuse by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“When spreading propaganda by publishing an advertisement in the Des Moines Register, the Chinese government does not respect America’s cherished tradition of free speech and a free press,” Branstad wrote.
“Instead, at the newsstand on the street here in Beijing you will find few voices of dissidents and you will not see any real reflection of the diverging views of Chinese citizens about China’s worrisome economic trajectory, given that the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of the most important newspapers in China refused to publish” his article, although he did not say which newspaper it was about.
Republicans alienate female voters ahead of midterm elections over Kavanaugh scandal, analysts warn
As many of the top Republicans support and protect Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh from multiple sexual abuse allegations, analysts have warned there will be a backlash, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions created by this scandal have been extremely strong, and most Republicans who have publicly discussed it intend to continue voting.
“Thus Christians will not be forgotten,” Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he had doubts that Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute initiative on an FBI investigation would calm the angry electorate.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow and they will not forget in November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and national spokesman for the progressive group, told the Washington, D.C. newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November!” as they demonstrated in the halls of the Senate when Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh’s nomination process despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be very great,” said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst for the news site.
“People say they were already very big and that’s true.
But they could be even bigger, especially among undecided female voters in the suburbs and the young electorate, between the ages of 18 and 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which he detailed allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that a backlash could follow if Republicans continue the confirmation process.
"This has turned into a trouble for Republicans," former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just the committee vote or the final vote or the possibility of Kavanaugh being confirmed, it’s also about how Republicans have treated this situation and how they have treated it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a Democratic electoral advocacy group, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be relatively divided about the part they should believe in after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh: a little more seem to believe the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41% of respondents strongly believe or believe it is likely that Ford’s testimony was true, while 35% said they strongly believe it or Kavanaugh’s testimony is likely to be true.
In addition, 38% said Kavanaugh lied, probably or certainly, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake’s initiative, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford as well as at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford swore an oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh had abused her drunkenly at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court nominee exposed her genitals in front of her while attending a party while she was a student at Yale in the 1980s.
Inventor of the World Wide Web plans to set up a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Solid, Berners-Lee’s open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has the right to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is “global dominance.”
“Now we have to do it,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data archives” or PODs.
It can contain contact lists, programs, calendars, music libraries or other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify would all be available in one browser, all at once.
What is unique about this online personal data archive is that the user has complete control over who can access this type of information.
The company calls this “personal data consolidation.”
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, the idea is for Inrupt to contribute the right resources, processes and competencies to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a team of developers working on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team aren’t talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change when their business models are completely screwed up all at once.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
Berners-Lee wrote in a Saturday post on Medium that “the mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new Internet on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Bernard Vann: The cleric who won the Victory Cross in World War I is celebrated
The only Anglican clergyman who won a Victorian Cross medal as a fighter in World War I was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann won the medal on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had been awarded Britain's highest military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled Saturday by his two grandchildren during the Rushden, Northamptonshire parade.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "wonderful to symbolize" that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under the intense fire of artillery and machine guns".
Later, he rushed to the front line and, with “a fantastic bravery,” opened the way for the soldiers, then attacked an artillery nest on his own and managed to eliminate three of the detachment’s weapons.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I’ll never be able to match, but that makes me feel humble.”
He, along with his brother, Dr. James Vann, also submitted a crown after the parade, which was conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said he "feel very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that a lot of people give him."
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206, but received cartoons with Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine you’ve been up all night to watch Bellator 206, a star-studded event, just so you can’t watch the main event.
The San Jose event schedule contained 13 matches, including six on the main panel, and had to be broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi was preparing to face Rory MacDonald, viewers in Britain were amazed when the broadcast was replaced by an episode of Peppa Pig.
Some were not happy at all, because they stayed up all night to watch the fight.
One fan described the move to children’s cartoons on Twitter as “a kind of bad joke.”
“Government regulations say this content isn’t suitable for 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children’s programs,” Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president for marketing and communication, said when asked about the broadcast.
“Pig Peppa, yes.”
Scott Coker, Bellator’s president, said that in the future, they will be programming their events in such a way that they can also be watched by viewers in the UK.
“When I think about the replays, I think we could probably work it out,” Coker said.
“But it’s six in the morning on a Sunday here and we won’t be able to do that until Sunday, our hour, or Monday, their hour.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, I started getting a lot of text messages and they weren’t all friendly.
We tried to solve the situation, I thought it was a technical mess.
But it wasn’t that, it was government regulation.
I can promise you it won't happen again next time.
We’ll be down to five fights instead of six, as we usually do. We’ve tried to give fans more and we’ve crossed the line.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley 'Feeling Lower' Due to Sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up knowing he was inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but this motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he got to school that “not everyone is like me.”
Invited to Lauren Laverne’s first Desert Island Discs show on Radio 4, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that when he became a parent, he cared less about the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular host of the traditional show, will be missing for a few months due to an illness.
Guest on Laverne’s first edition, Daley said that as a child he felt “inferior” to others because “it wasn’t socially acceptable to like boys and girls too.”
He said: “Until now, these feelings of inferiority and the fact that I felt different were the real things that gave me the strength and stamina to achieve success.”
He wanted to prove that he was “someone,” he said, so he wouldn’t let everyone down when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympics has become a renowned supporter of LGBT campaigns and took advantage of this year’s Commonwealth Games appearance in Australia to ask more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he decided to speak because he felt lucky that he could live free, without consequences, and because he wanted to give others “hope”.
The three-time world champion said he was “surprised” to fall in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black.
Daley last year married the Oscar-winning filmmaker, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference was never a problem.
“When you go through so much at such a young age,” he said, “he attended the first Olympics when he was only 14, and his father died of cancer after three years, it’s hard to find someone the same age who has gone through the same good and bad times.”
In June, the pair became the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, which Daley says changed his “whole perspective.”
“If I had been asked last year, I would have been interested in winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know what? There are more important things than the gold medals at the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he wanted was to find out if they had received tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be in the first place.
"I couldn't say, 'You can't be first, Dad,'" he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing and only after he stopped breathing and died did I finally accept that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I knew that was what I dreamed of a lifetime, to jump in front of the spectators of my country at the Olympics, there is no better feeling,” he said.
This also inspired him in his chosen music, Proud by Heather Small, a song that encouraged him before the Olympics and still excites him.
Desert Island Discs aired on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m.
Mickelson, out of shape, was put on the reserve bank on Saturday in the Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record for the forty-seventh game of the Ryder Cup on Saturday, but he will have to return to a good form so that this is not an unfortunate opportunity.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial event for the twelfth time, another record, was passed on to the reserve bank by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it has often been for the U.S. team, the 50-fold winner of major tournaments has divided his day between being a major for teammates and exercising his shots, hoping to straighten out what he did.
The 48-year-old has never had the fairest drives, even at the best time of his career, so it’s not the best choice for the narrow court at Le Golf National, where long areas of rough often punish wrong shots.
And if the field isn’t big enough, in the ninth match on Sunday Mickelson will face Francesco Molinari, the meticulous British Open champion, who has teamed up with novice Tommy Fleetwood and won all four games of the week.
Mickelson's match could prove absolutely crucial for the Americans, driven by four points at the entrance of the 12 singles matches, which must begin in force at this stage.
Furyk said he was confident in his player's ability, but he couldn't have said anything else anyway.
“I fully understood the role he had today, he beat me on the shoulder, he hugged me and told me he would be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play in two games.
I imagined more, but that’s what happened, and that’s how I thought we had to do it.
He wants to play, like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo’s record for the most games played in the Ryder Cup.
This could be the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which has never risen to his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, though Furyk said his presence brought some intangible advantages to the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s smart, he likes to joke with players, he’s a great guy in the team’s locker room,” he said.
“I think the young players have fun laughing with him, it was fun to see them doing it during the week.
His role is more important, it’s not just about the game.”
Europe’s team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the considerable advance may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the Europeans, knows from the experience that the considerable advance held before the first day of the simple trials in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable journey.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, when the team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros led the Americans by five points, but barely managed to beat them by a minimal difference, from 141.2 to 131.2.
“I remember we had a considerable lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we barely managed to win,” Bjorn said after watching the 2018 team win 5-3, both Friday and yesterday, and now driving 10-6 at Le Golf National.
“So history shows me and my team that it’s not ready yet.
Tomorrow we have to play at the maximum speed.
Let’s go out on the field and do everything perfectly.
The game is not ready until the points are passed on the table.
We have a goal and that is to win this trophy, it must remain the goal.
We’ve always said, we need to focus on the 12 players in our team, but we also know what’s waiting for us on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Delighted by the way his players have done on a difficult field, Bjorn added: “I’m not in a hurry to draw conclusions.
Tomorrow is a completely different situation.
Individual performance is important tomorrow, and this is different.
It’s great to be on the field with a partner when things go well, but when you’re on your own, then you’re tested to the fullest, as a golfer.
This is the message you need to convey to the players, that they need to be in the best shape tomorrow.
Now they’re leaving their partner behind and they have to play as well as they can.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk, the captain of the opposing team, hopes that his players will play better in the simple play than they did with the partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have won three out of four points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of such comebacks on the last day: he was in the winning team at Brookline, then in the losing team when Europe won the "miracle of Medina".
“I remember every word,” he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, managed to encourage his players before the last day.
“We have 12 big matches tomorrow and we would like to start with some quick wins, like at Brookline, like at Medina.
When inertia develops in one direction, put a lot of pressure on those matches in the middle.
We created the right lot and ordered the players the way we wanted to, you know, we’re trying to create a little bit of magic tomorrow.”
Thomas has been tasked with leading the fight: he will face Rory McIlroy in the main match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the second half of the show.
“I chose this group of players in this order because I think it covers all the topics,” Bjorn said of the lot for the simple trial.
Germany's New Warship Delayed Again
Germany’s newest naval frigate should have been put into service in 2014 to replace the outdated Cold War warships, but this will only happen next year, due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, which cites a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to be introduced into the maritime forces in 2014, but post-delivery issues have affected this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships that the Navy commissioned in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
They are expected to be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as stealth technologies, which provide a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic footprint.
Other important features will include longer maintenance periods; it should be possible for new frigates to depart on two-year missions without returning to the original port.
However, continued delays mean that these state-of-the-art warships, which are said to increase Germany’s maritime strength, will already be outdated before entering service.
The frigate F125 was discussed in the press last year when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the builder after delivery.
Not much information is available about the reasons for the refusal, but the German media cited a number of crucial “software and hardware flaws” that would have made the warship useless in a combat mission.
The software flaws were especially important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the crews on the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that the ship had too much weight, which reduced its performance and limited the Navy's ability to add future equipment.
The 7,000-ton ship Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as the German ships used in World War II.
In addition to faulty mechanisms, the price of the entire project, including crew training, has become a concern.
It is said to have reached the staggering figure of 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion), from the initial price of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of the newest frigates are particularly important given the latest warnings that Germany’s maritime strength is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence commission in Germany’s parliament, acknowledged that the Navy “began to run out of vessels that could be sent to missions.”
The official said the problem has grown steadily over time as old vessels have been taken out of service without being replaced by new ones.
He lamented that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class had entered service in the Navy.
The National Trust is spying on bats.
New research is being conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands to reveal how bats use the environment to hunt their prey.
It is hoped that the findings will reveal new things about the behavior of these new flying mammals and help future conservation activities.
The study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will examine common dwarf bats and pygmy bats, as well as eared bats and water bats from the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
The NHS team and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using manual detectors.
Specialized audio analysis of all recordings will estimate the frequency of sounds made by bats and which species emit certain sounds.
A habitat map and report will also be produced to create a detailed, scaled-up picture of their behaviour in the environment.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as lawn creation, and what is the best way to maintain forest meadows for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably in the last century.
They are endangered by construction and development work affecting their nests, as well as habitat loss.
Wind turbines and public lighting are risks, as are flies traps and some chemical treatments for building materials, but also attacks by domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to accurately identify insects and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major parks and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is thinking very seriously about bats.
They have ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, monitor nests, and sometimes conduct rescue missions.
The organization has even created Scotland’s first and only bat reserve, on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight out of ten species of bats are found in Scotland.
The estate manager, David Thompson, says this is ideal territory for bats.
“Here at Threave, the area is great for bats,” he says.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a perfect habitat.
But there’s a lot we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand why they need to grow.”
It emphasizes the importance of searching for bats before performing property maintenance work, as the mere unintended destruction of a maternal nest could kill up to 400 females and chickens, which can destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected, and killing, harassing or disturbing them, as well as destroying their nests, are prohibited actions.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official with the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help them.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about bats and we don't know how populations evolve for many of our species."
Ronaldo denies rape allegations as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo said the allegations against him were "fake news" and that some people "want to advertise" using his name.
His lawyers are determined to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese striker and Juventus team have been accused of raping an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported Friday that the footballer paid her $375,000 not to talk about the incident.
Hours after the allegations were published, in a video posted on Instagram Live to his 142 million followers, 33-year-old Ronaldo said they were “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news,” the Golden Ball winner said in front of the video camera.
“They’re going to advertise using my name.
It's normal.
They want to get famous using my name, but I'm used to it.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they called “an inadmissible report of suspicions surrounding private life,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz says the player will seek compensation for “moral damages equivalent to an amount appropriate to the seriousness of the offense, which is likely one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009, in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a club, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he raped her anal, according to documents filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo fell to his knees in front of her and told her that he was “a good boy” at “99%” and that he was betrayed by that “a percentage.”
The document alleges that Ronaldo confirmed that he had had sexual relations with the accuser, but that they were consensual.
Mayorga claims to have addressed the police and photographs of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later accepted a settlement outside the courtroom because she was “scared of the possibility of revenge” and was concerned that “she would be publicly humiliated.”
The 34-year-old woman is now seeking to cancel that deal because she continues to be traumatized by the incident.
At the time of the attack, Ronaldo was about to transfer from Manchester United to Real Madrid. This summer, he was transferred to Italian giant Juventus, after a transaction worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain 'forever regrets' loss of automakers
Britain “would regret forever” if it lost its status as a world leader in car production after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it would temporarily shut down production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis brands are manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90 percent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive at Burnaston.
Other carmakers in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have said they fear leaving the EU without a deal on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says that after Brexit, it will close the factory in Oxford where the Mini model is produced for a month.
The main concerns are created by what manufacturers call supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on the “fix on time” principle: for custom-made cars, parts arrive at 37-minute intervals from suppliers in the UK and the EU.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be problems at the border, which industrial manufacturers say could cause delays and a shortage of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more of the inventory for a day at its Derbyshire factory, the company says, so production would be shut down.
Clark said May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely calibrated to avoid these delays at the border.”
“We want to have the best deal, which will allow us not only to enjoy the success of the present, but also to take advantage of this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today.
“The evidence not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, shows that we need to be able to continue to use what has been a very successful supply chain set.”
Toyota could not say how long production would have to be stopped, but warned that higher prices could reduce the factory’s long-term competitive capacity and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the United union at the factory, said members are increasingly concerned: “Experience has taught me that once these jobs disappear, they don’t come back.”
A government spokesman said: “We have created a precise and credible plan for the future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed another week” as the fight for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein is overseeing special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia’s interference in the election, the links between Trump’s aid and Russia, and the president’s potential obstruction of justice.
Rumors of Trump firing the deputy attorney general, thus jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, have been circulating in Washington circles for months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of suspending the president through Amendment 25 to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and reports say he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was at the time at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate legal committee hearing, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump called for a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which again postponed the vote in the Senate plenary.
Trump’s press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “It has not yet been established once in this regard. It may be this week or it may be postponed by a week, taking into account all the other things that are happening now at the Supreme Court.
But we will see and always like to keep the press up to date.”
Some reporters would challenge this claim: Sanders has never had a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the reduction in the number of briefings was not caused by antipathy and TV reporters, who like to perform, though he added: "I don't deny that they like to perform."
He then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
“The president attends more question-and-answer sessions than all previous presidents,” she said, adding without mentioning any evidence: “We’ve looked at the numbers.”
“There will be more briefings,” Sanders said, but “I think it’s much better for the press to have the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, not to me.”
We try to do that most of the time and you could see that we’ve done it many times in the last few weeks and talks with the president of the United States will replace press briefings when it’s available.”
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting officials.
Press conferences given exclusively by him are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why this is happening, having an impromptu appearance, in bizarre places, in front of assembled reporters.
A Secretary of State for the Ministry of Health addressed in a letter to EU employees of the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland on fears about Brexit.
The Secretary of State wrote to EU employees working at the NHS branch in Scotland to express their gratitude on behalf of the country and their desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter as it is less than six months away from the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already made a commitment to bear the costs of applying for permanent resident status for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued, awaiting decision-making this autumn.
But the UK government has begun to prepare more and more for a different scenario, where there would be no deal to leave the EU.
I know this is a very stressful time for you.
For this reason, I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues in the European Union, and beyond, have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and also bring benefits to the patients and communities we serve.
You can consider Scotland your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a blow to the head
Tennessee State Tigers founder Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after suffering a blow to the head on Saturday in the match his team lost to Vanderbilt Commodores, scoring 31-27, said Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the crash took place shortly before the break.
“It got to the cough line and it just collapsed,” Reed said.
Abercrombie was put on the oxygen mask by physical trainers and medical staff on the cough line before placing it on a platform and transporting it from the field for a thorough assessment.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of the operation he underwent at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are no details yet of the type/area of the injury” and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it occurred.
Abercrombie, a year 2 student, is in his first season at Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, he managed to make five plywoods in total before leaving the match, reaching a number of 18 plywoods throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp court fee when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will pay a higher stamp court fee when buying a property in the UK, with additional money to be used to help the homeless, according to new Conservative Party plans.
This change will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s efforts to attract young people with voting rights.
Judicial stamp fee will be applied to people who are not paying taxes in the UK
Treasury expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp court fee when buying a property in the UK, and the additional money will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young people with the right to vote, promising more affordable homes and targeting high-income people.
The higher court stamp fee will be applied to natural and legal persons who are not tax payers in the UK, and the additional money thus obtained will be used to support the government’s efforts to help the homeless.
The surcharge, which adds to the current stamp court fee, including levels raised two years ago for the second property and properties purchased for rent, could reach a value of 3%.
The Treasury expects this change to add up to 120 million pounds a year.
Approximately 13% of new-build properties in London are bought by non-residents in the UK, which leads to higher prices and makes it difficult for those who want to buy their first home.
Several prosperous areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend much of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for lowering the stamp court fee to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the large construction firms of keeping property prices high as a result of buying land without using it, and urged Theresa May to drop taxes on affordable homes in order to solve Britain’s “home problem.”
Corbyn announced a number of attractive real estate reform proposals, including rent controls and an end to unreasonable evictions.
It also wants to give councils greater powers when it comes to building new homes.
Theresa May said: “Last year I stated that I will dedicate my premiership to fulfilling the British dream of a better life for every new generation.
And that means resolving problems in the real estate market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not fair that people who do not live in the UK, as well as companies based abroad, can buy homes as easily as hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become far too distant, and living in unworthy conditions is far too real.”
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to be the manager of Scotland’s national team”
Jack Ross, manager of the Sunderland football team, said his “final goal” is to become, at some point, the manager of Scotland’s national team.
The 42-year-old Scot enjoys the challenge of “revival” the northeastern club, which is currently in 3rd place in the Premier League, with a difference of three points from the first place.
He moved this summer to the Light Stadium team after winning the return of St. Mirren in the Scottish Premiership Division last season.
“I wanted to be a member of the national football team, but as a player.
We got into the B-team of the national team and that’s about it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“But I spent a lot of my childhood watching Scotland’s Hampden matches with my father and I’ve always wanted to come back.
But I will only have this opportunity if I succeed as manager of the club.”
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland managers include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager said he is not thrilled to be the successor to such an important club after he turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“The only thing that concerns me and could affect my success is the question, ‘Can I help this team get back into the Premier League?’
There is no doubt that the structure and facilities at this club allow it to be in the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not easy to get her there, but I think the only thing that would make me feel like a successful man is to contribute to the club’s return to the Premier League.”
Ross has only three years of driving experience, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and another 15 months as a member of the Hearts training staff.
He then helped Alloa recover after relegating to Division C and managed to save St. Mirren from relegation, helping the team win the championship title next season.
Ross said he feels better now than in his entire playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was a decisive moment,” he said of taking over Alloa.
“I thought it was better for me to be a manager than a player.
It may sound strange, because we had a good time, we won well and we had a few wrong moments.
But it's hard to be a player.
You have to do a lot of things and repeat them weekly.
I face similar situations as a manager when it comes to stress and pressure, but I feel it’s the right role for me.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now that I can do that, I feel like it’s the best thing I’ve done in my entire adult life.”

The ideal time to drink a pint of beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., according to a survey.
The heatwave this summer has led to higher revenues in UK pubs, but has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
According to the figures, pubs and bars grew by 2.7% in July, while restaurant revenues fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, CGA’s business advisory representative who conducted the survey, said: “England’s constant warmth and participation in the World Cup over a longer period than expected contributed to a similar pattern in July as in the previous month, when pubs had up to 2.8 percent more customers, while restaurants had a poorer period.
The 1.8% lower number of customers in the restaurant industry in June fell even further in July.
Pubs and bars that serve only drinks have a much higher profit than restaurants.
Pubs that serve food have also experienced heat losses, but not as big as restaurants.
It seems that people just went out to drink.
Sales of beverages at all bars and pubs increased by 6.6% this month, and food fell by 3%.
Paul Newman, RSM’s representative providing services in the hospitality industry, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather conditions and the impact of major sporting and social events remain among the most important factors contributing to sales associated with the OOH advertising market.
No wonder restaurants continue to suffer losses, though the 4.8% year-over-year drop in sales will add to current cost pressures.
The hot summer couldn’t come at a worse time for food industry operators and only time will decide whether the more moderate temperatures recorded in August will bring better news.”
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new ones, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the small number of new locations launched.
The company that monitors sales of UK pubs, bars and restaurants, the Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined profit of more than 9 billion pounds, which is the official industry standard.
One in five children has a secret account on a social network that they hide from their parents.
According to a survey, one in five children, some even up to the age of 11, has a secret account on a social network that he hides from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in “fake Insta” accounts.
The news has heightened fears about posts with sexual content
20% of students say they have a “main” account that they show to their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, create an account on a social network that keeps it hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in “fake Insta” accounts, referring to Instagram’s photo-sharing platform.
The news has heightened fears about posts with sexual content.
20% of students said they have a “main” and “clean” account that they show parents, but they also have other private accounts.
One mother, who accidentally discovered the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter, noticed the posting of a teenager asking to be “raped.”
According to research conducted by the UK’s Digital Awareness and Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) in independent schools, 40% of young people aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, and half of them have admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC Director Mike Buchanan said: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces that parents and teachers don’t have access to.”
Eilidh Doyle to be ‘voice of the athlete’ in Scottish Athletics Commission
Eilidh Doyle was elected as the non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Commission at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated track and field athlete, and Ian Beattie, the president, described the change as a great opportunity for decision makers to take advantage of the vast experience she has gained internationally over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys respect throughout the community of athletes in Scotland, the UK, as well as around the world and we are confident that Scottish athletes will have significant benefits with its inclusion in the committee,” Beattie said.
Doyle added: “I am delighted that I will be able to represent athletes and I hope to make a real contribution and help the way sporting activities take place in Scotland.”
The American national athlete, who won the 200-meter and 400-meter races at the 1996 Atlanta Games in addition to the four gold medals won at the Olympics, is now a frequent commentator on the BBC and has been disabled after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
She tweeted: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time will decide if or to what extent I will recover.
It was a titanic job, but I completely recovered, I learned to walk again, and today I do agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!”
A breast pump ad that compares women to cows divides public opinion online
A breast pump company has sparked the division of public opinion online with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers to cow milking.
To mark the launch of a pump that aims to be “the world’s first silent and portable breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie has launched an ironic music video-inspired ad to showcase the freedom the new pump offers nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay for cows on a song that includes lyrics like, “Yes, I’m milking, but I don’t have a tail” and “if you haven’t noticed, they’re not bears, they’re my breasts.”
The chorus continues: “I pump, pump, breastfeed, pump, pump, extract milk from girls.”
However, the ad, posted on the company’s Facebook page, sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video was the target of mixed reactions from those who viewed it, many of them claiming to bring out the “horror” of the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
“Like us, they must remain pregnant and be born to produce milk, except that their children are only stolen a few days after birth.”

Another person commented: “It’s understandable how traumatic it is for both mother and child.
Of course, why not use them to promote a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?”
Someone else added: “An extremely inappropriate advertisement.”
Others defended the ad, one person claiming it looked like a “hilarious” ad.
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I were still breastfeeding.
Pumping really made me feel like a cow.
The claim is a bit inappropriate, but I took it as such.
But the product is brilliant,” one person wrote.
Another person commented: “It’s a funny ad targeting mothers who use the pump (often at work or in the toilet) and who feel like ‘empties.’
It’s not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the group of women reveal that they danced with discreet pumps inserted into their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who use the breast pump say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and discreetly fits into a breastfeeding bra, giving women freedom of movement, the ability to hold their children in their arms, and even feeling alive while using the pump.
Ana Balarin, Partner, Consultant and Design Developer at Mother commented: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves such a bold and challenging launch.
Comparing nursing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight what it means to use a breast pump and the challenges in this regard, presenting, in a fun and real way, the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump will give.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump has hit the front page.
During the presentation of fashion designer Marta Jakubowski at London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly transferred to Texas border refugee camp
The number of detained migrant children has increased, although the number of people crossing the border each month has remained relatively the same, largely because the rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children at sponsors.
Usually, these sponsors are themselves undocumented immigrants and fear that they will endanger their stay in the country if they request to take children.
The risks increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors, as well as other adult family members, need to register their fingerprints and that their data will be communicated to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested sponsorship from unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“About 80% of the people who are sponsors or family members of sponsors live illegally in the country, and a large proportion of them are foreign criminals.
Which means we will continue to look for those individuals,” Albence said.
To speed up the process of processing children in the system, the authorities have introduced new rules, according to which children must appear in court one month after detention, and not 60 days after the previous standard, according to shelter employees.
Many will advocate for the case via a video call, and not personally before an immigration judge, to apply for legal resident status.
Those who are not considered eligible will be deported immediately.
The longer the children stay in custody, the more they can become restless or depressed, which can lead to violent reactions or escape attempts, according to employees of shelters and reports issued by the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns are heightened at a larger unit, such as Tornillo, where there is a possibility that signs that a child has problems are not noticed because of the size of the unit.
They added that moving children to the refugee camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could cause them trauma, which many of them already suffer.
Syria urges U.S., French and Turkish forces to withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although Syria has been at war for eight years.
Moualem, who is also interim prime minister, said foreign military forces are illegally in Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that “the situation will be properly managed.”
“They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions,” he said at the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “this sacred fight until we remove terrorist groups and the illegal foreign presence from all Syrian territories.”
There are about 2,000 U.S. military troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
Also, in the war-torn country there are more than 1,000 French military troops.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said there were conditions conducive to their return and accused “a few Western countries” of “spreading irrational fears,” prompting the refugees to keep their distance.
He added: “We have requested the support of the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return.”
“Political influences are brought to a problem that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have issued warnings that they will not support reconstruction in Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a demilitarized zone in the Idlib region to drive out the last group of rebels has created an opportunity to continue political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement helped to prevent a large-scale assault by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that military action will target jihadist groups, including those on the Nusra front, who have links to the Al-Qaeda network and who “will be eradicated”.
Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations envoy, hopes to meet soon in a first meeting of a new committee made up of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the ground for elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, stating that the committee’s activities should be limited to “reviewing the articles of the current constitution” and issued a warning regarding interference.
Why Trump will win the second term
If we follow this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020, unless the impeachment proceedings or scandals end his term as president earlier, which much of the liberal audience hopes will happen.
In this case it would be, without a doubt, “the most dramatic finale of a presidential term of all time!”
So far, it seems the audience is still interested in the subject.
Since 2014, prime-time audiences have doubled on CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled on MSNBC to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News is watched, on average, by 2.4 million people, compared to four years ago when it was watched by 1.7 million, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" recorded a record audience, with 3.5 million following it on major news evenings.
“This is a subject that appeals to the public, because we can’t understand it,” said Neal Baer, the producer of ABC’s “Reserve President” drama series, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after a catastrophic attack on the Capitol building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride through Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
“He said, ‘Because it makes me laugh,’” Scovell told me.
In chaos, entertainment is valued.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the action in Washington could determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade case, if immigrant families can be whole and about the state of the global economy.
Changing the job is a luxury that only the privileged public can afford.
However, you’re not just an informed citizen when you get to the sixth hour of watching the debate by a panel of experts on how Bob Woodward uses “deep background” sources for his book, “Fear,” about the 15,000-dollar ostrich leather jacket of Paul Manafort’s vestiture.
For example, I will never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
“Much of what he does makes you feel like you’re watching a reality show, and he’s feeding you topics every night,” said Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the show “The Handmaid’s Handmaid,” about the constantly changing cast and daily upheavals brought by Trump.
Don't let yourself miss an episode, because you'll feel like you're behind.
When I went to visit Mike Fleiss this week at his house on the northern shore of Kauai Island, outside it was 27 degrees and it was sunny, and he was sitting inside watching MSNBC and recording on CNN.
He could not get out of the way of television, especially as Brett Kavanaugh was to face the Senate's legal committee and decide the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember doing some unusual shows in the past, and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it looks like they were right.”

Overwhelming external financial resources for the tightest midterm elections associated with the House of Representatives
As a result of a realignment of the electoral districts, which resulted in two incumbents in a race for the same office, it is not surprising that the 17th electoral district of Pennsylvania enjoys overwhelming financial resources.
Thus, the new suburb of Pittsburgh brought Democratic representative Conor Lamb into the race, who won, in another district, last spring's special election.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th electoral district, which significantly overlaps with the 17th.
Electoral maps were reconfigured after Pennsylvania's Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutional, with district boundaries being manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race in the 17th New Electoral District sparked a competition in campaign funding between major party funding bodies, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a special, high-profile election held in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Electoral District.
For more than a decade the office had been held by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won in this district by a difference of 20 points.
According to political commentators, the Democrats enjoy a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its deal with China, but then gave up.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a welcoming meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners evacuated the Trump Organization’s leadership team.
State Department officials have decided to call the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama as a result of “recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” Heather Nauert, the department’s spokeswoman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But they were taken into consideration sanctions only against the state of El Salvador, which received US aid worth about $140 million in 2017, including for narcotics control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and the high rate of unemployment and crime in it.
As domestic meetings progressed, officials in North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to continue a similar meeting last year, considered a step forward in efforts to prevent the targeting of migrants to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials had made it clear they wanted to continue the conference, effectively ending any review of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the conference, scheduled for mid-October, wanting to highlight the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. ambassadors returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without receiving any new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who have agreed to discuss internal deliberations only if their anonymity is maintained.
Their reports were corroborated by an external analyst, who is close to the administration and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next thing that could happen is Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, of which there is now solid evidence made public.
Mueller is also reportedly directing his investigation into the existence of a plot between Trump’s campaign and Russia to attack the US election.
If Congress changes, Trump will face due accountability within the body, even as he prepares to appear in front of voters and possibly a jury made up of his colleagues.
There are many possible situations and I do not want to suggest that a “fall” of Trump is inevitable, which also applies to his counterparts in Europe.
There are choices that all of us on both sides of the Atlantic must make and that will decide the length of the investigation.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to strike a coup against Hitler unless the West opposed and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and thus missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history depends on such critical moments, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing a few such critical moments right now.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since it was reported in this newspaper that last year he suggested secretly registering the president and speculating on his incompatibility with the role of president.
Rosenstein said the Times report was incorrect.
“How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or if he is upheld in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail to pass these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I don’t think we will fail after the lesson we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial residence.
He survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on the swastika table.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about the game with Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, the Rangers will be the home team for Rapid Vienna, knowing that victory in the Austrian match, after Spain’s impressive draw against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will place them in a strong position to qualify for the European League Group G.
A knee injury did not allow midfielder Graham Dorrans to play this season up to 2-2 with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result to his advantage to achieve better performance.
“It was a good point for us as Villarreal is a good team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We started the game thinking that we would get a good result and we won a point.
We probably could have scored in the end, but overall, I think the equal was a fair result.
I think they were better in the first half, and we did better in the second.
Thursday will again be an important night for Europe.
With a little luck we will get three points, but it will be a difficult match, because they had a good result in the last match played. However, having the support of the fans, we will surely feel even more motivated and we will have a positive result.
Last year was clearly a difficult one, given my injuries and the changes at the club, but the situation is better at the moment.
The team is fine and the guys really like to be here; the training also goes well.
Let’s hope that we will persevere, that we will leave behind what has happened in the last season and that we will have good results.”
Women have insomnia due to retirement savings
Despite the fact that survey participants clearly knew how they wanted to be cared for, few people spoke to family members about it.
About half of the people who participated in the Nationwide study said they were discussing the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t start this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, the nationwide vice president of life insurance.
Here's how you can start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide the care you need if you don’t make your wishes known in time.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices could be a significant factor in setting costs.
Involve your financial advisor: and the financial advisor can be of real help when it comes to paying these expenses.
Your long-term care financing choices can include a standard long-term insurance policy, a mixed cash life insurance policy, to help you cover those expenses, or you can insure your own well-being – as long as you have the money.
Set up your legal documents: come face to face with legal issues.
Get an empowerment on medical decisions, to designate a trusted person to oversee your medical care, and to make sure that the professionals in the field respect your wishes where you can’t communicate them.
Also consider making an authority on your financial resources.
Choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions on your behalf and ensures that your invoices are paid if you do not have the capacity to do so.
Do not forget the small details: imagine that an elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about his medications and allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan to be prepared.
“And it’s not just about the financial part, can you tell who the doctors are doing it?” Martin asked.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of their dog?
Write a plan for all these things.”

The injuries did not endanger their lives, and the police called on witnesses to give statements.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died from a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit Indonesia’s Palu city on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the disruption of communications networks, disaster authorities were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala regency, an area in northern Palu, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key information about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, which sits at the end of a narrow gulf on the western coast of Sulawesi, with a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating 40 years of existence when it was hit by the tsunami and the earthquake.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along a coastline with an area of more than 300 km in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The Regency, an administrative region that lies at the bottom of a province, has a population of about 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are central to the economy of the central province of Sulawesi, especially the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining activities are also important in the province, but are mostly concentrated in Morowali on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami struck the western part of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Circle of Fire, an area of intense seismic activity.
Here are some of the earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
On December 26, 2004, a powerful earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of whom were from Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006 – A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit the south of Indonesia’s most populous island, Java, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit one of the Mentawai Islands off the coast of Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters in height that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A low-intensity earthquake occurred in the Pidie Jaya king of Aceh, causing damage and panic as people remembered the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami that resulted in a large number of deaths.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died due to collapsed buildings.
2018: More powerful earthquakes have occurred on the tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stuck under the rubble.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for vice president, Sarah Palin, has been arrested on allegations of violence.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, being involved in a domestic violence complaint and opposing arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaskan police.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in police custody at the Mat-Su unit, awaiting trial, and is being held on a $500 no-deposit bond basis, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded “100% innocent” when asked to plead guilty, according to the network.
Palin faces three counts of class A offenses, which means he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a class B crime, which is punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged with this.
In December 2017, he was charged with violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to announce the alleged assault.
The case is being tried at the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, becoming involved in a domestic violence crime claim and possessing a gun while intoxicated in connection with an incident.
According to the statement of his lover, he punched him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after her son’s violent behavior was associated with the post-traumatic stress syndrome he suffers from after being part of the Iraqi military.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck Indonesia’s Sulawesi island on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake on the Richter scale triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are damaged and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The quake occurred in the central province of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital of Jakarta.
There are videos on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the town of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
U.S. Attorney Wants Death Penalty for New York City Terrorist Attack Suspect
The federal prosecutor’s office in New York seeks the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, a rare punishment that has never been applied in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
It appears that Saipov, 30, used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists on his trajectory in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious bodily harm, according to the Notice of Intent on the Request for the Death Penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both heads of prosecution can receive a capital sentence, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury charged Saipov with 22 counts including eight counts of organized crime murder, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and premeditation,” prosecutors said, describing how Saipov executed the act as “odious, cruel and depraved.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injuries, suffering and losses to the families and friends of the following people: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” the statement read.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last trial of a death penalty case in the Southern District of New York.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death sentence in a federal case in New York City was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, two husbands executed on charges of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, an Uzbek citizen, showed no regrets in the days and months following the attack.
He confessed to investigators that he liked what he did, according to police.
Saipov told the authorities he felt inspired to carry out the attack after looking at ISIS videos on his phone, according to the defendant.
Also, according to police, he asked to fly the ISIS flag in the hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the defenders who represented Saipov, said he was "evidently disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to apply the death penalty, instead of accepting a life sentence plea with no possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s team of defenders had previously asked the prosecutor not to apply the death penalty.
Conservative MP Says Nigel Farage Must Lead Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed today to "mobilise the civilian army" during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians must “feel the pressure” from eurosceptics, following a statement by parliament member Theresa May that suggested she should be at the forefront of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative Party lawmaker Peter Bone told a rally in Birmingham that Britain would have "knew" so far if Farage was secretary of the Brexit campaign.
But May’s challenge to the highly divided camps was heightened by Conservative Party members joining another protest against leaving the European Union in the city.
The prime minister is trying hard to get his compromise plan, the so-called Chequers plan, carried out properly, facing attacks from those who support leaving the European Union, those who want to stay in it, as well as from the European Union.
The allies stressed that she would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, regardless of consequences, and would force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between her offer and “chaos.”
Bone said at the pro-Brexit “Leave Means Leave” event in Solihull that he wants to “cease the Chequers plan.”
He suggested that Farage should be part of the team and be given the responsibility associated with the negotiations with Brussels.
“If things were run by him, we were no longer in the European Union,” he said.
The Conservative member of Parliament, the Wellingborough constituency representative, added: “I will support Brexit, but we must abandon the Chequers plan.”
Referring to his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We have not fought in world wars to be slavish.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone denied suggestions for a change in public opinion in the 2016 vote: "It's not at all true that the British have changed their mind and want to remain in the Union."
Andrea Jenkyns, a Conservative Party supporter of Brexit, was also at the demonstration and told reporters: “I just want to say this: Madam Prime Minister, listen to people’s voices.
“The public does not agree with the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for it, our party does not agree with it, nor our activists who go out on the streets and who support us, in the first place, in the elections.
Give up the Chequers plan and start listening.”
In a message to Theresa May, she added: “The prime ministers who keep their job are the ones who keep their promises.”
At the rally, Nigel Farage said politicians should be put in a position to “feel the pressure” if they are about to abandon the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“It’s a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them we’re not going to let them do that.”
In a message to enthusiastic fans, he added: “I want you to help us put pressure on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
“We are mobilizing the country’s civilian army that has brought us victory in Brexit and we will not give up until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, supporters of staying in the European Union marched through Birmingham ahead of a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small group of activists raised banners saying “The Conservative Party is against Brexit” after the group’s launch this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, laughed at members of the Conservative Party and the security issues they faced in the party's application at the start of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us they can implement IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus, for the digitization of customs procedures, for free and unrestricted trade in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a farce.
“Brexit has no benefits,” he added.
Warren is serious about running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
According to the Boston Globe, the Democratic senator from Massachusetts spoke about her future on Saturday at a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in the November election against Geoff Diehl, a Republican House member who co-chaired Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She was at the center of speculation that she could beat Trump in 2020.
Holyoke’s Saturday afternoon event was the 36th meeting of eligible citizens using the city hall format since Trump took office as president.
One participant asked her if she was going to run for president.
Warren responded that the time has come for “women to come to Washington to solve the problems of our severely affected government and this includes having a woman at its forefront.”
A Suspect Has Been Arrested In The Death Case That Caused The Death Of Sims Player From The LSU Team
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, on Saturday announced that a suspect had been arrested in the death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at an ET press conference at 11:00 a.m.
They posted a video of the shooting Friday, asking for help identifying the man in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head causing his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the scene, that he was in possession of a gun, and that he also shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into police custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 1.98-metre-tall junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games, being 10 times in the initial batch last season and playing, on average, 17.4 minutes with 5.6 points and 2.9 recoveries per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after his team helps him win in front of Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the orders given by the Mercedes team will play a key role in the race.
Being first in the standings, Bottas had a good start and almost defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to stop at boxing and left Hamilton at the group's queue, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes stopped at the pit a lap later and came from behind Vettel, but Hamilton managed to move forward after a few schemes that forced the Ferrari driver to let the inside go, after making a double move to defend himself on the third turn.
Max Verstappen started the race on the back row of the casing and was in the wrong place near the end of the first round, just the day he turned 21.
He then led for much of the race, aiming for a quick finish and trying to overtake Kimi Raikkonen and take fourth place.
Eventually, he stopped at boxing at lap number 44, but could not increase the pace in the last eight rounds, with Raikkonen remaining in fourth place.
“It was a tough day. Valtteri did an exceptional job all weekend and behaved like a real gentleman, letting me get through town.
And the team has done an excellent job to win in front of Ferrari and to achieve this double.”
A terrible body language
President Donald Trump ironed out Sen. Dianne Feinstein on Saturday at a rally on her insistence that she did not “facilitate” the leak of Christine Blasey Ford’s letter, which accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, commenting instead that what is happening in the Senate has shown that people are “bad, immoral, and liars.”
“The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and bad and immoral and lying,” he said.
“When you see they posted and leaked information and then say they didn’t.
They are not responsible.
Do you remember?
When did I ask Dianne Feinstein if she facilitated the "leak" of the document?
Do you remember her answer? He said, umm..what?
Oh, no.
I didn't do that."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we do that?...No, I didn’t,” he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and was “leaked” in September, but Feinstein denied that the “leak” had occurred from her office.
"I have not concealed the allegations against Ford, and I am not the one who facilitated the leaking of her story," Feinstein told the committee.
“He asked me to keep my privacy, and that’s exactly what I did.”
But her denial doesn’t seem to have struck the president, who commented during Saturday’s rally: “To be honest, it was terrible body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use the accusations to achieve their own ends.
“I’m determined to take power in any way possible.
Observe the evil, the immorality, they don’t care who they hurt and who they have to destroy in order to gain power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: The Dundee Stars win 5-3 against the Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars team paid for Friday's loss in the Elite League, winning in front of the Belfast Giants in Saturday's return match, scoring 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants had a two-goal lead with Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie matched the score before Dwyer brought the Giants back in front of the opposing team.
Francois Bouchard matched the score for Dundee before two goals scored by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third Elite League defeat this season for Adam Keefe's players, who had regained ground by defeating the Dundee team 2-1 on Friday night.
It was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the last three games.
Dwyer's opening show started in the fourth minute, 3:35, from a pass by Kendall McFaull, then David Rutherford passed decisively to Beauvillier who doubled the team's lead four minutes later.
In a match that started so dynamically, Sullivan brought the host team back into the game in the 13:10 minute, before Matt Marquardt gave Cownie the opportunity to score an equal score in the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the first break, when he scored his second goal at the end of the first half.
The host team regrouped and Bouchard equalled again with an impressive goal in the 27:37 minute.
Later, in the second half, Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen gain an advantage for Dundee for the first time in that match, thus ensuring the team's rise to fifth place in the standings by the middle of the final half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will host Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller died after crashing a plane with hundreds of passengers during an earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is considered a hero, dying after securing the safe take-off of a plane with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a powerful earthquake rocked the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
There have been several strong aftershocks in the area and many people are stuck under the remains of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to leave his post in the control tower of the rattling Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport.
It remained in place to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at that time, would take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the air control tower when he noticed he was about to crash.
He died later in the hospital.
A spokesman for the Indonesian air navigation service provider said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
I've prepared a helicopter to transport it from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning, before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We are saddened by this news,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, with the national disaster management agency declaring that access is limited in the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
“We believe that the number will increase as many victims are still in ruins and we have not had access to many of them,” the agency’s spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said in a statement.
Waves up to six meters high devastated the city of Palu, with a joint funeral due on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute, an ambulance brings casualties.
It is almost impossible to find drinking water.
All the mini-markets are robbed."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to provide help to the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find on the spot.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national army: “Please work day and night to complete all evacuation operations.
“Are you ready?” said CNN.
Indonesia was rocked earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says a person is missing after a plane crashes in a lagoon
The airline that owned the plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia is now claiming one person has been missing after it previously said all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that a male passenger had been missing since Saturday afternoon.
She said she was trying to find the man, along with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional passenger details, such as age or nationality.
Local boats were used to retrieve the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water as it tried to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, authorities said seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained at the hospital on Saturday and that many were in stable condition.
It is not yet known what caused the accident and the exact order of events.
The airline and the U.S. Naval Forces said the plane missed the landing strip and reached a lagoon next to it.
Some witnesses believe the plane has passed the end of the runway.
U.S. Nationality Passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had reached a very short distance from the ground.
“It’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers were able to cross the water, which had reached the girdle, and reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Naval Forces said sailors working nearby to refurbish a lander had jumped to help, using an inflatable boat to transport people to the shore before the plane sank 30 meters underwater.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in airline crashes registered in PNG over the past two decades, but none of them included an Air Niugini plane.
An analyst presents the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor’s office ended its pleadings for resuming the trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert witness in information analysis.
He presented to the jury how he used the cellphone recordings to piece together the actions of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and his 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said she had received location data from several cellphones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, contradicting her earlier claims, according to the Clarion Ledger newspaper.
The moment the data revealed that his cell phone was with Chambers when he said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was summoned to the witness stand and confessed that he was not alive that day.
When prosecutors asked Tellis if he told the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s van that night, Sanford said he “lies because my van was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile phone records indicate that they had known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
“He wiped it out of his life,” Hale said.
According to the schedule, the defense will begin its final plea on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the jury to decide at the end of the day.
The High Breed: What is Mindful Hip-Hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to change the negative way this genre of music is seen, with the help of songs with positive messages.
Bristol’s The High Breed says hip-hop has stopped sending political messages and tackling social issues, as it originally did.
They want to go back to the origins and make hip-hop consciously popular again.
A recent revival of artists such as The Fugees and Common has been observed in the United Kingdom through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another person of color?
A New York babysitter sues a couple for firing her after she received a “racist” text message.
A nurse in New York sues a couple for dismissal on discriminatory grounds after they accidentally received a text message from their mother complaining that she was “still a black person.”
The couple denied they were racist, saying she sued them for “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her dissatisfaction when she learned that her new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she showed up on her first day at work in 2016.
“YOU! NO MORE A PERSON OF COLOR,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him to Maurice twice.
After realizing the blunder, Plasco-Flaxman felt embarrassed and fired Maurice, saying that the nanny, who is African-American, had not properly fulfilled her duties and had expected to receive a nanny of Philippine nationality, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her day of work and sent home with Uber.
Now, she sues the couple for compensation for their dismissal and demands $350 a day for six months, the period during which she was to live and work with them, despite the fact that this was done without a contract.
“I want to show them that such things are not being done,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s about discrimination.”
The couple deny claims they are racist, saying it was normal to fire Maurice because they feared they could no longer trust her after they offended her.
“My wife sent him a wrong message.
He is not a racist person.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco, her wife, told the Post.
“But would you leave your children in someone’s hands that you’ve misunderstood, even if by mistake?
The newborn baby?
Let's be serious."
Considering the trial an "extortion" action, Plasco said his wife would be born in two months and that she was in a "very difficult situation".
“Do you really want to take revenge on a person in such circumstances?
That is not the case,” added the banker.
While the trial is underway, public opinion has accused the couple on social media, prosecuting them for the behavior and logic they have shown.
Editors of Paddington’s story fear readers won’t be able to identify with a talking bear, according to a new letter.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said the following about the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it’s published.
It’s very funny now, after seeing Paddington have been hugely successful.”
She also said her father, who was a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a toy bear to write the children's book, would be optimistic about rejecting his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was a "sweet-bitter" after he died last year.
About Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family,” she added that her father had a discreet pride in the success she enjoyed afterwards.
“He was a pretty quiet man and he didn’t like to brag,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like he had a child who had a reaction: you’re proud of him, even though it’s not your reaction.
I think he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation, based on his imagination, he always deserved Paddington’s credit.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was quickly transported to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nothing rings often to tell me it’s very serious and he doesn’t think he will survive,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nad telling me that she’s going to die in the next two minutes and that I have to say goodbye to her.
And that's exactly what I did.
I said, "Tashi, my dear, I love you so much.
We'll be together soon.
I'll join you.
The effect of medications given by doctors for her heart to continue pumping blood began to diminish and come out of her body.
He died a short time ago and his organs were no longer functioning.
I had to sit there and wait, aware of everything that was going on.
I couldn’t scream or scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to control myself."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, grieving over the death of his daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers, who did not know what he was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I kept my head down and the tears kept flowing.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I had an overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
I realized he needed love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Two grieving women place various messages on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who lost their loved ones to suicide try to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place various messages on a bridge in Wales, many of which are motivational and include phone numbers that people can call for support.
Sharon Davis’ son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I do every day,” she said.
Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and says his son was going to be a promising cook with a grin.
“Everyone loved his smile.
They always said that his smile changed your mood.”
However, he gave up work before he died, as he had reached a very unhappy moment in his life.
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after taking his life.
Davis said, "I keep thinking you're going to have a domino effect."
She created the messages to tell people that they can call someone or talk to someone, even a friend.
Go outside, you need to talk to someone.”
Kelly Humphreys, Davies' longtime friend, lost Mark, his 15-year-old life partner, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t tell me he wasn’t feeling well or he was depressed,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, I noticed that he changed his attitude.
He was in a deplorable state on Christmas Day when the kids untied their presents and didn’t even look them in the eye.”
She said his death was a huge trauma for them, but she has to overcome it: “It caused tremendous pain within the family.
We're devastated.
But we have to go forward and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh’s future is at stake as a result of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s investigation into the case.
“I thought that if we could get something similar to what he was asking for – a limited-time, small-scale investigation – we could have a little unity,” Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was about to “disintegrate.”
Why didn’t Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance is entirely due to the temporal factor.
It’s only five weeks away from the November 6 election – if Republicans are expected to score poorly, their attempts to place the one they want winner in the country’s highest court election will be significantly weakened.
George W. Bush repeatedly appealed to the senators to persuade them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI finishes the report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to make a difference in the case of equality and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of fugitives drops under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean fugitives in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's unification ministry, said about 1,127 people fled the country last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the key factors were more stringent border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs levied by those illegally transporting people across the border.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment.
A vast majority of North Korean fugitives are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul officials say more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two sides of Korea.
China considers fugitives to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between North and South, which are still practically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for a few talks on denuclearization.
This came after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed, in general terms, to collaborate for a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused U.S. sanctions have caused lack of progress since then.
“If we can’t trust the United States, we won’t be able to trust our national security, and in such situations, we won’t be the first to unilaterally disarm,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi describes Brett Kavanaugh as “hysterical,” saying he is unable to serve on the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic minority leader of the House of Representatives, described Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court nominee, as “hysterical” and said his temperament was inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if there was a woman in this situation, she would have been declared 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied allegations that he sexually harassed Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and losing his voice because of the emotions, while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the accusations against him “a grotesque and coordinated character assassination” organized by angry liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she felt Kavanaugh’s testimony proved he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed he was biased against democracy.
“I think he disqualifies himself from those statements and the way he attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi deviated from the issue when asked if she would try to suspend Kavanaugh if he was confirmed and if Democrats would win a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I just want to say this: If he doesn’t tell the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then it’s not just not right for the Supreme Court, but it’s not right for the court he’s in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible rulings against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh ignored the question of whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
“It’s not the right time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Oh, how wonderful!’” Pelosi said.
And women must be able to handle it.
It is a justified diatribe, there are months and years of accumulated anger and it cannot speak without bursting into tears.
“We cry when we get angry,” Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s unusual, do I?”
She continued: “I received significant help from a woman in an executive position, who told me that she was crying when she was nervous, but that she developed a technique that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to: ‘You might think I’m sad because you see me crying.
I'm nervous."
And then go on.
I thought it was a brilliant thing.”
Tears are allowed for the exteriorization of anger, partly because they are fundamentally wrong.
One of the clearest memories from one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, where I started crying because of an inexpressible rage, is that I was grabbed by an older woman’s neck, a cold director I always felt a little bit afraid of, and took me up the stairs.
“They never have to see you crying,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
I think you’re sad and they’ll be glad they provoked that feeling.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a congressional Democrat in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on the presidential election.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an extramarital relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Schroeder, extremely frustrated, thought there was no reason not to run for president herself.
“It wasn’t a very thoughtful decision,” she says laughing, 30 years later.
“There were already other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone referred to the situation as “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
As the campaign was nearing its end, she was behind fundraising and vowed not to enter the race if she failed to raise $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She found out that some of her supporters who had given the men $1,000 were giving her only $250.
“Do they think I’m getting discounts?” she asked.
During the speech in which he announced that he would not officially launch a company, he was so affected by emotions – due to the gratitude for the people who supported him, the frustration caused by the system and the fact that it was so difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, but also the anger caused by gender discrimination – that he lost his voice.
“You would have said I had a nervous breakdown,” recalls Schroeder about the reactions of the press to her.
“You would have said that one of my sponsors is Kleenex.”
I remember thinking about what they would write on my gravestone.
“Did he cry?”
How can the trade war between the United States and China be beneficial for Beijing?
The salvos announcing the start of the U.S.-China trade war have been deafening, and while there seems to be a long way to go, quarrels between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued his first warning earlier this year by imposing taxes on key imports from China, including from solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation came this week with new taxes affecting $200 billion worth of goods, effectively levying taxes on half of all Chinese goods reaching the U.S. territory.
Beijing has avenged itself every time, most recently imposing a tax of between 5 and 10 percent on US products worth $60 billion.
China has warned that it will respond to every blow from the United States and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will take a step back in the near future.
For Washington to withdraw, China must agree to its demands, but giving in publicly to the United States would be far too humiliating for Xi Jinping, China’s president.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, U.S. pressure on trade war could support China positively in the long run, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could lead to an economic downturn in both countries would actually be more dangerous than predicted so far,” said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready for refugees to return, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding the country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
During his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country is improving.
“Today, conditions on the ground are more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists so that things return to normal.
The existing conditions allow the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that targeted their daily lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war broke out in 2011.
Six million people who continue to live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be happy to receive help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that conditional assistance or assistance from countries sponsored by the insurgency would not be accepted.
European team wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup after defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The United States has now recorded its sixth consecutive win in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe came back in first place after the team led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points, necessary to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who has put incredible efforts into much of the tournament, sent the ball from the initial hit into the water to hair 3 from hole 16, yielding the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has had an incredible performance in all stages, becoming one of four players with a 5-0-0 result since the current tournament format, since 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost in holes 5 and 4 to the last-place player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
World-leading player Dustin Johnson lost in holes 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, which is probably his last game in the Ryder Cup.
A Ryder Cup veteran who has participated in eight editions, the Spaniard Sergio Garcia, has become the player in Europe with the most wins, scoring an average of 25.5 points throughout his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help myself.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I am very happy that I was able to win the cup again.
It’s teamwork and I’m glad I could be of help,” Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
He handed over the baton to his countryman, John Ram, who defeated Tiger Woods, an American legend of the gulf, at holes 2 and 1, at the single-player game on Sunday.
“I’m very proud to have beaten Tiger Woods. I used to watch his matches when I was a kid,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods has lost all four matches in France and now holds a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 important titles, being surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
All weekend, the American team put in a real effort on the golf course, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played extraordinarily throughout the entire tournament.
American team captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I’m proud of them, they really did try.
This morning, there were a few moments where we put pressure on the European team.
I had a tough fight.
Hut down for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played well.
I will work with PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will move forward.
I’m proud to be a captain to them.
We must give them due respect.
They played better than us.”
