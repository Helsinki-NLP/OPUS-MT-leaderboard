At the end of the exchanges, the Prague stock exchange plunged into the negative
After the fall of Tuesday morning, the Prague stock exchange rectified its losses.
Transactions with EZ shares reached almost half of the usual daily exchanges.
On Tuesday, from the beginning of the exchanges, the Prague stock exchange resumed with its fall from the previous day, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the decline is due to the fall in stocks on Wall Street.
The market's reaction to the result of the vote in the U.S. House of Representatives, which refused to adopt the stabilization plan for the U.S. financial sector, is also noticeable here.
Decline in stocks in Asia
Asian stock markets experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, even though the indices managed to wipe out some of the losses over the course of the day.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange’s Hang Seng Index lost four percent during trading, but later wiped out some of the losses and reduced the decline to nearly 2.5 percent.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange’s Hang Seng China Enterprises Index lost 3.8 percent as markets were closed in Shanghai.
Shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange were losing more than five percent, but eventually the losses were reduced to 4.3 percent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 percent.
“The hesitation about bailout action in the U.S. will affect financial markets around the world,” said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it establishes its monetary policy itself, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as in the United States.
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said U.S. lawmakers should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries may be affected.
The Bloodbath of American Actions
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the plan to support the financial system, to which it should have spent up to $700 billion (nearly $12 trillion).
Legislators thus renounced the call for support for President George Bush's project.
According to Bush, the project should solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks suffered a bloodbath on Monday and major stock indices saw the biggest drop in the past 20 years.
The Dow Jones index lost nearly seven percent, having experienced a drop of this magnitude for the last time in 1987.
The index was already losing during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal had not been adopted, it was in free fall.
Congress Gives Up: US Government Can Inject $700 Billion into Banks
The leaders of the U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of the financial aid agreement for the U.S. financial system.
It will be put to the vote early next week.
U.S. lawmakers made a decisive turning point in talks on the adoption of a bailout plan in the form of $700 billion (about 12 trillion kroner) in financial aid to the U.S. financial system.
Success is not certain.
Indeed, before they can publish the final version of the law and put it to the vote, Congressmen must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The financial system support plan will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Barney Frank, chairman of the House Banking and Financial Regulatory Committee, told Reuters on Sunday.
According to sources, the plan should be put to a vote in the Senate on Wednesday at the earliest.
According to economists, the announcement that the bailout will be adopted should be a major psychological first factor in reviving financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms by which aid to markets can be effective, a "disillusionment" will follow.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have settled our differing views on how the package of measures for stabilizing the market should be shaped,” Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg News Agency.
The final vote could be taken as early as Sunday.
On the night of Saturday to Sunday, lawmakers met with U.S. Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give the government its final form.
It is expected to repurchase from financial corporations the unsold real estate assets that lead financial firms to considerable losses and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
“We are about to agree on a plan that will work and must also be effective in the market.
We still need to continue this plan to restore markets, but I think we are here," Paulson said.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on falling equity markets.
According to the Democratic senator do not evade Harry Reid, lawmakers make sure that Congress reaches a definitive agreement as early as Sunday.
They want to calm investors ahead of the start of trade in Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where the congressional decision could affect trade on Monday.
But at the moment, it is impossible to say with certainty when the two Houses of Congress will proceed to the vote, nor if the negotiations are not likely to remain blocked, at the last moment, by this or that problem.
Lawmakers hope it will be adopted in the coming days.
However, the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount allocated to the system shall be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wanted, should be available as soon as possible.
But if Congress has the impression that the program is not fulfilling its function, it has the possibility of blocking the granting of the remaining amount, following two steps: first an additional 100 billion dollars, then, finally, 350 billion dollars.
Mr. Bush praised progress in negotiations
Although the president may veto this decision, Congress has the option of putting it in the minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which consisted of obtaining finances for the purchase of bad real estate securities, the value of which fell, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
“All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to pass the bill on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday,” said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
U.S. President George Bush himself is pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
Spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the bipartisan effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Limitation of golden parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, said lawmakers agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, protecting contributors from losses, agreeing on relief, and moving the plan along the time axis.
The new law also provides for the limitation of gold parachutes for directors of participating companies and establishes a committee to oversee the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard on the issue and made significant progress towards a deal that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also provides help for homeowners, who have problems paying.
The government should negotiate new advances in the case of mortgages it will buy back, while reducing the monthly payments of debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
According to Patria Finance Chief Economist David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its implementation will be very difficult.
“And that’s because we don’t know what the mechanism and price will be for repurchasing the troubled assets.
This point will be decisive in deciding on the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be adopted now, or early next week, is, according to Marek, not that important.
“It’s much more important that congressmen agree this week that they will support this plan and commit to it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, providing for the adoption of the plan, matters most at the moment," Marek said.
A struggle pushed to the extreme: MP3 players against mobiles.
We will advise you, how to choose
While virtually all mobiles know how to play MP3 files, no MP3 player knows how to call.
It seems clear that it is better to buy only a phone.
However, there are enough reasons to get an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the way of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy an expensive high-end gramophone for home to put Maxim Turbulenc's new album.
On the one hand, such musical products do not come out on vinyl record, and, from a quality point of view, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
Now, if there are vinyl records in your shelves piled up, with rock art, jazz or blues, you are at least probably dreaming of such a gramophone.
The same goes for music on the go, i.e. compressed music, so to speak in a simplified way - music in MP3.
There are also categories based on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a player, just as a Pink Floyd fan would struggle to support headphones purchased for twenty crowns at the market.
These are two extremes, between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
Battery life is also crucial
Some high-end music players are capable of much more than just playing music, but these are unknown features, of course, from most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, phone calls and sending SMS, it is able to play music and movies, record them, it has a camera of varying quality and can, for example, even serve for navigation.
And if you take smartphones and communicators into account, you’ll have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no refrigerator knows how to grill meat and no television will take photographs, we are virtually witnessing a miracle.
However, the universal character of the mobile is not without drawbacks.
The larger the number of functions you use, the shorter the interval between reloads.
And playing music is one of the most important energy waves.
There are few mobile phones that are able to play music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases, this figure is much lower.
In this regard, music players (especially the most rudimentary) are much better performers.
In the case of cheap mobile phones, expect that they will only play music for a few hours.
If, in addition, you happen to call from time to time, get, to be sure, a second charge for the job - this is valid even for more expensive devices.
The problem will not arise for MP3 players, which are capable, following a reload, of continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the less efficient ones.
Another problem occurs when recording music in mobile.
Unfortunately, a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, especially since not all of them can be directly connected to the computer, without special software.
It is obviously possible to record music directly on the memory card, but few card readers know how to do it without reduction, given the tiny dimensions of the memory cards used in the mobiles.
As for the drives, you do not need, except for the iPod, any software.
Simply fill in, through the USB connector, the music device coming from the computer.
Most mobiles and players will create a media library themselves, sorted by the performer's name, album title, style, or user's judgment.
Some devices only display an index with a tree structure, like the Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Readers are easier to manipulate, mobiles have more know-how
When choosing a specific device, be especially interested in the battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of sound output and, of course, ease of control.
If the music is for you, essentially, a background sound and if in the day you are going to listen to it only for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you just have any mobile playing MP3.
Virtually every mobile device is capable of doing this today.
You don’t even have to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or player is able to play.
They all manage to play MP3s and the vast majority of the music that will reach you will have just that format.
It is one of the most popular formats and apart from it, the vast majority of devices can also play WMA-format music.
The AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods) is less common.
High-end mobiles also allow, for example, the purchase of music online.
Just visit, from the mobile phone, the corresponding web pages of the operator (or those of another provider) and buy the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a compelling reason to purchase a musical device.
The offer of operators is unfortunately miserable and it is limited, in most cases, to quickly made radio tubes.
Prices are not the lowest either.
Nevertheless, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (whether by GSM, internet, or even wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their mobile on themselves.
Whenever you feel like listening to something, you just need to get the phone out of your pocket, when you’ve forgotten your MP3 player at home.
However, it is also important if you always have headphones or a handsfree with connection.
If not, you can use the built-in speakers, which have virtually all mobiles, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of mobile music is its price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand.
For a price of three or four thousand crowns, you can have a Walkman already very suitable.
However, in most cases, you will be limited by the absence of output for regular headphones.
The price of the best phones and the best tools, also equipped with an input for ordinary headphones, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
Readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy command.
Truly anyone manages to ensure the command of the most rudimentary readers - who do not necessarily correspond to the cheapest ones (cf. our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the resemblance of the control to that of a cassette station, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of a collision in the form of a randomly connected mobile internet, followed by a huge data transmission invoice.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. the Vodafone 527) usually have an exchangeable memory card slot (the M2, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you are not going to exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
Basic models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive ones get away with even 8GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or an iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you should not spend more than 1,100 kronor.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners, choose specialized walkman mobiles (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are provided with independent control keys for MP3, and this is how the ease of control approximates that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles in the walkman series have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that has gone the most in this field.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a longer battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the brands mentioned above.
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced, with our operators offering virtually the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we still lack something - a virtual operator, which would force conventional operators to lower prices.
It may not be missing for a long time.
We have already mentioned on Mobil.cz that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
The Czech Telecommunication Office, which reported that the price of an SMS was higher in our country than in the rest of the Union, confirmed this.
Thus, following the latest steps by the European Commission in the regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation may occur - text messages sent from abroad will be for some customers of Czech mobile operators cheaper than in the country.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really like to enter the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, given that we still have three mobile networks and penetration that far exceeds 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this regard, Pavel Dvosak, the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunication Office (CTO), who has repeatedly stated that in the Czech Republic there is no room for another operator, choruses with the operators.
It is probably true that a conventional operator with its own network is apparently not very lucky (by the way, now it would find only difficult frequencies).
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It is precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that has led to a considerable drop in prices, to which conventional operators must subsequently also react.
Yet, even before holiday troublemakers such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the market, voices similar to those we hear today were heard in Britain.
However, it turned out that there was room for such operators and that they could have a real success.
We do not have to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you about the launch in Poland of the virtual operator Mobilking.
In just six months, this operator has managed to win more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth operator in the country.
It should be added that behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which owns the U:fon in Czechia, among others.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more concrete target group.
For their operation to be effective, they need far fewer customers than a conventional operator.
They are, in fact, exempt from the relatively high costs of construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
This is how virtual operators around the world profile themselves as low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often counterbalanced by a limited service offering.
Tesco Mobile, for example, offers SMS at least twice as much as its competitors in the UK.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, betting on an unusual target group can also be a good publicity shot.
Indeed, this operator specifically targets men.
“Real men choose Mobilking – an operator they like and can trust,” said David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It’s hard to say, if such a concept would be likely to work at home as well.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav ?epick? said: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
Especially since it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the supply of services."
In the Czech Republic, no chance, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
“We are discussing the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations are not very supportive.
Instead, the launch of Mobilking will take place in other countries in our area,” Jana Studniková, a spokesman for the Penta financial group, said in a telephone interview with Mobil.cz.
It thus indirectly confirmed that the operators in the Czech Republic were, in any event, not in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything possible so that a potential competitor cannot appear.
The GTS Novera group, which would like to take a new step towards becoming a real competitor of Telefonika in the field of corporate customers, has not been hiding, for quite some time, its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
“We want to be able to offer our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have already negotiated this possibility several times with all Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have managed to move forward in the negotiations," said group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
Perhaps the future is promising.
According to unofficial information, it looks like we might be able to host the first virtual operator by the end of the year.
But for now, his creation is accompanied by total silence.
“Right now, we don’t think there’s room in the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is in comparison with others very specific.
At the moment, no topic with a complex and serious project in this area has contacted us," said Vlastimil Srääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääääää
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová said in a rare agreement with O2's statement: "We have not yet recorded a viable and bilaterally advantageous project, which could serve as a base."
She added: “It is virtually excluded that a virtual operator will appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
To operate in such a limited timeframe, we should have a concrete agreement now.”
Vodafone instead directs its attention to fulfilling the requests to obtain its own 3G license.
Miroslav Sepick said: “We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of shared fees and infrastructures.
This is what we believe means the most input from the customer’s point of view.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to set up a common network for fast mobile internet.”
Responsible authorities: in tune with operators
The approach of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a decrease in prices and therefore to a decrease in their profit.
What’s the point of making it easier for such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, operators know how to understand themselves as fair thieves. The chicane accompanying the creation of the U:fon also testifies to this.
The biggest apparent pressure on the T, when the U:fon was created, was that exerted by the company T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the T’s web pages.
Today, U:fon serves as an argument for not accepting a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted in this regard: “Competition in the mobile market has also recently been amplified by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the character of the mobile market in RT, it is obvious that the entry of an additional player would subject him, and especially his services, to high demands."
But given the attitude of the mobile operators here, the indifference of the Czech regulators seems bewildering.
However, it is not only about the attitude of the T, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately does not have the power to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
The latter belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (OHS).
However, the latter adopted, in the face of this problem, its typical position.
The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question regarding the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been reached at the moment, as the offer of potential stakeholders has a priori not been of sufficient interest to conventional operators," Kristián Chalupa, from the OHS Department of External Relations, said in a statement.
Such a declaration would not surprise representatives of the operators.
But on the part of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and among other things also take care, that no one takes advantage of its position in the market, such a declaration is more than confusing.
Kristián Chalupa adds: "Overseas, where virtual operators are normally present, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile phone services."
However, pushing for fair market functioning and price reductions is apparently not in the interests of the OHS.
What is indeed shocking is the almost touching agreement of the three mobile operators, which stems from their reactions.
The question, if this is really a coincidence, naturally arises.
In the same way, a price of gasoline that is strictly identical to all gas stations is probably due to chance and the hard fight of the competition.
"The Office has not found, in this regard, signs of anti-competitive behaviour, so it has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position, and therefore none has an increased corresponding responsibility for its behaviour on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile market to virtual operators are probably lacking even at the telecommunications regulator,” Chaloupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many points of contention.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the ‘T’, according to which telecommunications constitute, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators has a dominant position in such a market.
However, some legal experts propose a different view of things: in order for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, it is necessary to obtain, each time, the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator has quite logically a monopoly on its network.
This is how he necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of his activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least worrying for the OHS that three mobile operators visibly proceed in a similar manner.
However, the complaints of many interested parties (including the company GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
Getting the responsibility back on the T is a fairly common turn in communications, through which the OHS washes its hands of the case.
We have already encountered this type of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recently adopted telecommunications law has failed to bring about an expansion of the OT's powers in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many experts have promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the OHS must know this very well, but their interests seem to lie elsewhere.
When no one is watching, it can work.
That said, the functioning of some sort of pseudo-virtual operators, several in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies that publish their own price lists of mobile phone services, but these are only partially public.
In most cases, it is about companies dealing with multi-level marketing.
Personalized mobile phone services are offered by, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms usually only reach elected officials.
The magic trick consists in the fact that the company does in front of the operator figure of a classic business customer, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, she gets special pricing (and other) offers.
What is problematic is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a resale.
"If what you're talking about happens, it could be a breach of the contractual terms that we would consider and that could result in a stoppage of collaboration with the company in question," Martina Kemrová said.
However, it is quite unlikely that an echo of such activity has reached the heads of mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned it can be thousands of customers.
However, no operator has spoken out against such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these companies bring them significant benefits, and, at the same time, as opposed to real virtual operators, they do not threaten them in any way with their own official marketing.
Miroslav ?epick? points out the possible problems: "The law allows such speculations, however, the services of these companies are only used by a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it, in the manner of ordinary customers of mobile operators."
But that is precisely what should seem strange to you.
There is also another question in the OHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such a procedure, why do they block the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the OHS has relatively broad powers to disclose such an activity, and if it does not wish to be satisfied with the explanations of the operators, who claim to have no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions prohibit it.
When we are no longer the most expensive country
As we have already mentioned on several occasions, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a considerable decrease in the price of services.
However, in virtually all countries where virtual operators appeared, conventional operators sometimes tried more, sometimes less, to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were practically the same - a market too small, if not too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In developed countries, however, it was precisely at this level that regulatory bodies intervened, defending not the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Both through formal measurements and informal pressure, they eventually obtained the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, Czech regulators treat this issue like a hot potato that is discarded by passing it on to a nearby target.
As a result of the experiences we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that confusion in their skills is in these cases more than beneficial.
But let's not throw the stick after the bang.
If the behind-the-scenes information is true and a virtual operator will soon appear at us, the Czech mobile market may be back in motion.
If one of the operators has agreed to the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult for the OHS to remain impassive in the face of rejection (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And we may stop calling it more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of Czech Nationality Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov maj (Where is my homeland?).
The anthem was again recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Ji? B?lohlávek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo, a choral performance and an instrumental version.
Singing is performed by Kate?ina Kn?nková and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremia and Jaroslav Kruek are the authors of the anthem arrangements.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Belohlávek considers the Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously entrusted to the Czech public radio station, he chose solo versions of the singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
“From the beginning, I was trying to make sure that both singers, as well as the choir, had a good diction, so that we can understand the lyrics well, that they sing simultaneously,” he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
In 1834, the Kde domov m?j chants first resounded on the plates of Stavovské divadlo (Theater of States) in Fidlova?ka (Kermesse of the Savoyers), a Czech original piece by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by the music of Franti?ek ?kroup.
It became popular and people spontaneously appropriated it.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first pair became an integral part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" hymn sound
Prague public transport (MHD) will introduce the chip into their ticketing system on Wednesday.
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be inscribed in the history of the Prazsky Dopravní podnik (Prague Transport Agency) as the date on which the first passengers will board the metro, trams and buses, which, instead of having a paper ticket, will have in their pocket an electronic coupon.
At the moment, the latter is accessible to about one hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard smart card.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day or 90-day coupon (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and have it recorded on their smart card at the information points and offices of the Dopravní podnik (the Transport Agency), located in the Muzeum, M?stek, Nádra?i?h Hole??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
From yesterday, there is also the possibility to buy coupons via the internet on the web pages of the Dopravní podnik: www.dpp.cz.
More than 400 people took advantage of the service during the morning.
Those who will start using the online store can permanently forget about the ticket counters at the subway stations, where until now they had to tread impatience in long queues in order to get paper tickets.
Indeed, they will buy their coupon online and they will save it on their Opencard card in one of the thirteen M?stská knihovna (municipal libraries).
"At these points of contact, there is a ticket desk with trained staff, who will help those interested with the purchase via the internet and, in addition, will save the coupon they bought on their card," says project spokesman Martin Opartrno.
In addition to the libraries, it will also be possible to save the electronic coupons on the Opencard in vending machines installed in the vestibule of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket composting machines and passengers may have already noticed them at the Roztyly, Budzjovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, there should be eighty," Opartrno added.
An automaton will control the coupon instead of the driver
Automates that will work from tomorrow, are easy to use.
Simply enter the Opencard smart card and the previously purchased coupon will register itself on the card.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surroundings of the city.
Namely in suburban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which mainly use the inhabitants of the municipalities of Central Bohemia to access the capital.
"In the integrated trains in Prazká integrovaná doprava (integrated transports from Prague), the controllers are equipped with card readers, with the help of which they establish the temporary and zonal validity of the coupons;" explained the control of the Filip Drápal tickets of the organization Ropid, which designs the schedules of the Prague public transport.
The peri-urban buses are equipped with card readers built into the driver’s box.
When boarding it is therefore necessary not only to show the smart card to the driver, but it is also necessary to place the Opencard in the place indicated on the side of the checkout.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the registered coupons.
"In case the passenger needs to verify the validity of the registered coupons, there is nothing simpler than asking the driver for this information," Drápal said.
Passengers who do not take peri-urban buses and will not remember the date when their coupon expires, can rejoin the ATMs, initially used to save the coupons on the card.
It is here, on the screen of the device, that information about the validity of their document will be displayed.
Sudetenland demanded a referendum in the US
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans demanded that Umava be integrated into the United States.
This stems from a letter deposited in the collections of the Jihoeská vädecká knihovna (The Scientific Library of Southern Bohemia).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to at least live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, some groups of Sudeten Germans allegedly addressed the President of the United States with such a desire.
This stems, among other things, from a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jihoeská vädecká knihovna.
In the letter, the Germans from Krumlov asked the US president not to allow "Sumavská ?upa" (forest region south of Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
“We understand the situation and we want to be really sure that the words proclaim that American troops come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,” the letter read.
Given that rallying to Czechoslovakia is purportedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - only brutality, inconsiderate attitude, misunderstanding, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter urge the American president to take into his hands the protectorate of the Umava for now and forever.
“We cannot believe that you would grant this territory to a state foreign to us, which oppresses and destroys minorities and has contributed nothing to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of a quarter of a million people,” the letter reads.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the president of the United States doubted the opinion of the Germans of ?umava, he would only have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to establish whether its inhabitants wanted to be part of the United States, or to live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text contained in the letter may, in view of current knowledge of postwar history, seem somewhat naïve, according to some survivors, it illustrates well the expectations of the Sudeten Germans of the time.
While the Czech Germans had to at least foresee that the question of their expulsion from the republic would arise, very few of them admitted such a possibility.
Some expected that the United States and Britain would obtain a certain type of autonomy for the Sudetenland.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who was born in the town of ?eské Bud?jovice, confirms this.
During the war, he was, as a German to Cheské Budajovice, engaged in the navy in the Baltic countries.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the English and placed in the capture camp of the Holstein region, dozens of Czech Germans came to consult him to teach them Czech.
“They believed that once they returned home, the Czech would be of benefit to them,” Chalupa said.
None of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war believed he would be expelled from the republic as a result of the Benesh Decrees.
You don't think - you pay!
An emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
A way to characterize the emotional media campaign that intends to launch, Wednesday, the Ministry of Transport.
The Office of Minister Alești Ebișek believes that it will discourage drivers from dangerous driving behavior.
This $150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, the internet, but also on flyers.
It should discourage drivers from fast driving and alcohol behind the wheel.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
Above all, it wants to touch the conscience of young drivers, bikers, pedestrians, not to mention professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
This is also reflected in the campaign’s “bloody” slogan:
You don't think - you pay!
The phrase "You don't think" is capitalized on the license plate.
Then, in a pool of blood, there's the phrase "You'll pay."
Which must symbolize that one can pay with one’s life a moment of inattention.
The spots will “have” spectators until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with drastic images of the victims of the accidents are commonly seen.
It believes that this will lead to a decrease in the accident rate and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
The sugar and whip strategy against drivers
“What works with drivers is the sugar and whip system.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by saving time, when they grill a red light.
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
The risks must be reminded to drivers," said Martin Kozán, a transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertisements, the psychologist believes.
Signs signaling danger to drivers are already less effective.
"When a static panel that warns against a danger is installed, it will probably quickly merge with the environment and drivers will not notice it anymore," Kozán said.
Olmert would return in exchange for peace almost all the occupied territories
Ehud Olmert, the president of the Israeli Provisional Government, favored the restitution of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
“We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all,” Olmert said.
“We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of the Israeli territory), since without that, peace will not be made,” he added.
He admitted that possible restitution would include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants safety in Jerusalem, and especially does not want tractors and bulldozers to crush his feet, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," Olmert said, referring to the two attacks in the city in July, in which several people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historical places" located inside the Old City.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won’t work,” he said later.
Retirement from the Golan Heights
Olmert also supported Israel's retreat from the Golan Heights, which he said was a prerequisite for a peace deal with Syria.
However, this would also require some efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of a Golan retreat," he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relations with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (the Shiite movement); they will have to give up the constant support they give to the terrorism of Hamas (the Shiite movement), Al-Kaida (the terrorist network), as well as that of Jihad (holy war) in Iraq.
Questions that arise after the accident: Are stewards in the bus illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long-distance bus is forbidden
In the context of the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency near Padua, Italy, the question arises whether stewards and passengers can travel inside the bus.
"If the law is to be strictly and formally respected, the activity of a steward is contrary to the road traffic law," Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka said.
The accident in question, during which a 22-year-old hostess died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck crossing the bus path.
The girl was unfortunately sitting next to the driver in the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had two other seats at her disposal.
However, the bus can have an accident or even brake abruptly, even when the steward serves coffee or distributes newspapers.
What matters is whether the bus is under its technical data sheet equipped with standing seats or not.
If this equipment for standing seats is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
The long-distance Student Agency coaches do not have standing spaces; this was confirmed in Aktuáln.cz by the director of the company Radim Jan?ura.
“This is an issue that we have dealt with with the ministry and, at first, it prohibits any movement of passengers.
Then they canceled it and we got passengers to go to the toilet during the ride as long as they have their own seat,” he said.
The law ignores the steward.
“There is no unambiguous legal interpretation of the role of steward – there are no legal requirements for that role.
On the other hand, no legal requirement prohibits the carrier from offering services.
The road transport law knows only the term vehicle receiver; it does not define his rights and duties,” Hanzelka added more ambiguously.
Josef Pokorn, head of the road vehicle traffic department, said the law dealt with the issue adequately.
“It all depends on whether the coach has permission to offer standing seats in its approval.
It’s all in there,” he said.
Buses are divided into urban, where there are standing places and limited maximum speed, long-distance with standing places and higher authorized speed, and long-distance buses without standing places with the highest authorized maximum speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on a plane, says an expert.
Jaroslav Ho?n, an expert at BESIP (Road Traffic Safety) on transport safety, does not see the movement of stewards on board as a major problem.
"In regular traffic, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of service in airplanes.
Nor is he sure when a turbulence will occur and the air hostess can hit her head."
“But if the bus braked abruptly, the laws of physics would obviously be valid.
Same way as on an urban bus or tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of the stewards through internal prescriptions," he says and also believes that from the point of view of the law, the issue is not resolved.
Janura is ready to remove these services
Student Agency is the only bus carrier to offer stewards services.
He hires two hundred.
Even after this accident, the manager does not consider their job as a risky job.
"However, as soon as I get the impression that this is a risky profession, I will remove it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and newspaper at boarding.
It would also reduce costs,” he says.
The safety concern is the reason given by the absence of stewards in his vehicles by the director of the Asiana Alexeï Litvine, who ensures, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines.
"We don't have hostesses. We've opposed them from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in a deadly accident," he told T?den.cz a year ago.
A huge tragedy has arrived.
A young hostess from the Plzec region, who had worked for the company for two years, died in the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop strip without using a flasher and blocked the way to the bus.
The driver of the latter trying to avoid it by means of a sudden maneuver, but he bordered it on his right side.
Janura refuses that the two seats reserved for the stewards’ rest have been sold.
"In the case of long-distance lines, it is not possible to reserve these seats, they are blocked."
The company plans to file a complaint against the truck driver.
For the compensation of the family of the girl, the agency will not wait for the judgement of the court, but as for the financial compensation, she also counts on the culprit.
An amendment to the law?
Not in sight
An amendment to the law, which has been being drafted for more than a year by a group of thirty experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide clarification on the movements of stewards on board the bus.
"But it has not reached any conclusion on this point.
In fact, she is not too interested in buses, but rather in the points system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile phone behind the wheel," says expert Ho?n.
“The Ministry of Transport does not consider stewards’ activity to be something that would fundamentally jeopardize the safety of passengers,” Hanzelka said, adding that control of the safety of buses is under the power of the police and the Office for Safety at Work.
The hopes of the Düsseldorfers rest on Frankfurt.
The big words were not lacking in the letter addressed by the WestLB board of directors to the employees of the house.
Through a union of the entities of the Düsseldorf financial institution with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank, "the central financial market institution of the financial group of the Sparkasse" could be formed, according to the letter made public on Monday.
The WestLB would bring a "competence block" coupled with sustainable productivity in such a case.
All in all, such a relationship could be the decisive starting point for other concentrations in the Länder' banking sector.
This is what it looks like when a board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because the WestLB, injured, is always under great pressure.
It was not only the European Commission but also the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority that made it clear to the government of the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia that time was in the search for a future solution.
However, there has been talk for some time now - also on the Frankfurt side - of a relationship of some form between Deka bank, which knows the customers of the Sparkasse through their investment funds, and the WestLB.
It is true that Deta-Bank chief Franz Waas made it clear at the presentation of the half-year figures at the end of August that he saw no meaning in the merger of the Mainzer Landstrasse house with a Land bank, be it Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Deka Board of Directors, each of which is supported by the Länder banks and savings bank groups, has instructed the Steering Committee to conduct talks with the WestLB for joint commercial activities.
It could then be the debit of the financial market, or parts of it.
However, the talks have only just begun, it is said in the financial centre.
This is not the first time that the Deta-Bank, with its 3,000 employees, counts for one of the largest employers in the Frankfurt financial centre, has come into play when it comes to the consolidation of the savings sector.
In 2003 it was believed for a while that the Deta-Bank could merge with the Land Bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and Halbab.
Nothing came out of this ternary bouquet.
As soon as the plans had been made public, the Hessian government was against any participation of Hellaba in them.
Later, the other two houses did not join.
The Land Bank of Rhineland-Palatinate was instead attached to the Land Bank of Baden-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new negotiations on the merger of the Deka-Bank with Länder banks.
Lastly, however, Hellaba chairman Günther Merl had spoken out against any commercial merger strategy with his bank.
Regardless of this, the feeling seems to be spreading that the regrouping of the various institutions of the public sector is particularly urgent.
Now that the Bavarian Land Parliament election has passed, a union of the BayernLB with the Baden-Wuttenberg Land Bank could become a reality first.
For Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure for new mergers were to increase, the potential partners would gradually escape.
In the South, it would now be a junior partner, although it has so far withstood the crisis better than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The Hesse-Thuringe savings and transfer group, which owns 85 percent of Helaba’s capital, pulled a lock earlier this year on the entire union with WestLB.
The NordLB would be left to the rigor.
Such geo-strategic reflections, however, reflect only one facet.
Another facet raises the question of how the different business models of each of these banks can be matched.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive issue, namely by which business model the future capacity of the Länder' banks should be ensured, had hitherto not been solved by the German grouping of savings and transfer funds.
In the long run, a splitting of the WestLb could take place, a splitting that is obviously not desired here.
This is also what is discussed in the letter of the current board of directors: in any case, a "comprehensive solution" would be sought for the establishment.
How all this will be put in the same basket with the union of certain entities with the Deta-Bank remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanies her as a girlfriend, and so nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, close to a five-litre barrel of Kaiser brand beer, stands a well-built beard that shows about 200 beer festival visitors what deep sounds his throat can produce.
Elena hits Luca first, then kisses her.
From Bologna, they came all the way to Verona.
From there, from the bus station near the Puorta nueva station, four buses take the departure tonight at 23:45, 'destinazione Monaco, festa della berra', scheduled arrival at 6:30.
Three buses are reserved primarily for Italians, in one of the buses Brazilians travel exclusively.
In one corner of the parking lot, South Americans sing gold and already next to their flag, they already celebrated last night.
And also noisy, explains Marco Guarda, it is not for Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, who wears a long coat lined with fake fur and glasses with wide silver frames.
For five years, they have been going to the beer party, already three times this year alone.
They go there at night, stay the day at the party, and return at 10:30 p.m.
Spending the night there would involve unnecessary expenses, Marco explains.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with Bavarian purity law, health insurance and a German-speaking group official - Marco did a language course in Frankfurt.
And already the buses drive in the night on the Autostrada direction Brennero.
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly, everything becomes calm in the bus, travelers sleep.
It is better that way, they will still need their strength.
Breaks will be made in Brixen, and Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian license plates will once again take a break just before Munich, on Highway 8.
When in the early morning, Marco's group finally arrives at 6:30 as planned in the parking lot near Place Thérèse, nearly 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco gives one last speech, explains the plan of attack.
First, take care of the little yellow cap.
Above it is written on the left 'Beer Festival', in Gothic, and next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
“When the doors of the beer tent open, we run,” Marco shouts in the early morning.
Run!' Run and reserve seats at the bottom of the tent.
“Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow caps on the same benches, we have to distribute them in the room!”
The chope, Marco shouts, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the instructions!
Show Security Officers We're Behaving Well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they are gone!”
Thirdly: Tonight, to come back here at ten and a half a.m.
And that's it, we're on our way to the beer party.
Along the way, someone tie yellow caps to trees to find the way, signs and even an electoral poster of a large Bavarian popular party.
We want to be ready for the return.
It’s the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the Italians’ weekend.
There are no precise figures; we are talking about 50,000 who are going through the Alps and collapsing in the beer kiosk, 10 percent of visitors would have come expressly from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police force is reinforced by seven policemen from South Tyrol, by Italian volunteer rescuers who support the Bavarian Red Cross, which performs a statistic on the countries where Italians occupy the first place in front of the British (60 interventions) and Austrians (about 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
The one that is particularly appreciated by Italians is the tent of the Hofbräu brewery.
Insomnia Nights for Hypo Real Estate Shareholders
The German banking system is relatively stable, the Federal Minister of Finance insisted only a few weeks ago.
What a good chance that the politician used the word ‘relatively’ and slipped that the German banking sector would not be spared by the crisis movements.
This one actually happened this weekend.
The Bavarian real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), on the side of the DAX, obtains from a consortium of German banks a loan of one billion to protect itself from market turbulence.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the aid credits are being issued up to a sum of 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate would now have to pay interest on the fraction to which it would be entitled.
The money comes as much from private banks as from public-law banks.
In the background, it is daughter company Depfa who bears the losses.
The state financier had, according to a newspaper article, refinanced himself in the very short term for long-term projects for which he had borrowed money – which is no longer possible because of his distrust of the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve had been reduced by 95 percent to 2.37 million euros, while the equity rate had also slightly decreased from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Ongoing and net earnings from financial transactions had fallen to zero compared to the same period the previous year, earnings from the allocation of defined receivables and securities as well as the termination of provisions in credit operations had fallen by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros.
And it was only thanks to the significant profits derived from the reimbursement of downstream accounting costs arising from the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as the reimbursement of interest according to the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for the companies of Konzern that the profit deficit of about 16 percent turned out to be moderate.
After his privatization in 1990, the former state financier had initially badly speculated on industrial real estate loans, which had then been branched out to the Aareal bank.
Because conventional state funding was not profitable enough, Depfa had then engaged more intensively in infrastructure projects and in the financing of projects between private investors and the state (PPP) and internationally diversified.
On the value of the daughter company, the Hypo Real Estate must make amortizations that should have an essential material effect on the calculation of the group’s earnings and losses, which is still quite unclear.
The fact is that the dividends have been amputated.
By 2007, they had been cut to two-thirds.
Since the acquisition of Depfa, Hypo Real Estate has been a highly important state and infrastructure investor.
It is stronger than other refinancing-dependent institutions in the inter-bank market since it has no client repositories.
With the bankruptcy of investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the allocation of credit between banks has once again drastically stopped, as banks have accumulated their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs a portion – about 50 billion euros – of Depfa’s total loans annually as a short-term means of refinancing.
According to a statement from Hypo Real Estate, the group’s financing need is covered with medium-term credit and the company protected from the influence of international financial markets that are currently largely out of order.
Other sources say the refinancing would be ensured through the funds until the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke said the Hypo Real Estate group should no longer have to resort to medium-term financial markets.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Services Surveillance Institution (Bafin) assume that the Hypo Real Group's market capacity is now assured.
The bank’s shareholders and creditors have only to hope for.
However, given the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis, there is no certainty.
Moreover, it is not unthinkable that funding should not be used in its entirety.
Nor can the opposite be ruled out.
After the bank is, according to the latest press releases, still on the doorstep of insolvency late Sunday evening, this rescue at least provisional will not succeed in reassuring minds either.
The stock price collapsed from 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
Bond prices, on the other hand, are doing particularly well.
While debts in the first place have barely moved, the prices of second-tier loans are declining.
The most affected are the investment funds of the former daughter company Württemberg Hypo and of course those that have a lifespan beyond 2009.
The bonds of Hypo Real Estate seemed to be an alternative speculation investment, now their value must be considered dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net hardening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the very institute that brought the crisis into the institution by the purchase of Depfa Bank.
As long as less-affected issuing institutions, governments and commercial banks are still ready to support the system, one can assume that arrears will be resolved over time.
Or what no one dares to hope right now will happen – that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of the renewed sounds of partial nationalization, the probability that approached certainty has now become a mere well-founded hope.
This should set aside sleepless nights primarily for long-term creditors on the decision whether to separate from their commitments.
Short-term investors can still use what they have drawn a line on to constitute a deferral of losses for the next few years to the next automatically levied capital gains tax.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Box in Bento
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is due to show up for the first day at Tachibana Highschool, the girls start laughing: the German is so "kawaii"!
What's that supposed to mean?
Sylvana already knows this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new Exchange Log, she talks about Japan.
"The first day of class in Japan.
What was I excited about?
The way to school was frightening.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and take the train for 40 minutes to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find the way by myself, thankfully I didn't get lost.
The start of the courses does not seem to be as strict as at home in Lower Saxony.
Students appear one after the other from eight o'clock, until at nine o'clock minus twenty, a round of the table begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the class started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I’m not the kind of person who likes to talk in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I didn’t have the school uniform yet, I put on my host mother’s old skirt, as well as a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
So in this outfit, I showed up in front of the desk, and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all did low Masses, chuckled and made signs, and I constantly heard the word "Kawaii."
I already knew him from my manga.
It belongs to the vocabulary indispensable for the survival of Japanese teenagers and means "sweet, cabbage".
Then I quickly slipped into my place.
The girl next to me gave me a big ironic smile, she thought it was an honor that the correspondent should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the gong resonated, I was assaulted by the rules.
Everyone was talking to who better, laughing and asking me a lot of questions - in this case, it's pretty hard to understand English Japanese.
During the break, they all took out their Bento.
My host mother had also made me this kind of Lunchbox - it's really something other than the miserable German snacks.
I had rice with aromatic herbs, small sausages, a cucumber and algae salad, fruit and a sort of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I’m eating right here in Japan.
Things look weird and taste completely new.
What is certain is that everything is really good.
Well, except maybe the candied salty plums, brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento that she has prepared herself, and which is then prepared particularly carefully - in the hope of being able to make a little better acquaintance with the boy during the break.
I read that in my manga.
I'm curious if I can see it here too.
“Why Japan in particular?” my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
So I always answered:
“Because it fascinates me, what?”
In the end, reading manga has been my favorite thing for years.
And in order to better understand the manga and the culture that is there, at one point I also started to learn Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, customs and customs.
And here, they are given a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends – on the other hand, it is harsh, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
Rats also have sensations.
A rat or a cockroach runs away from danger, does that mean they also feel fear?
Neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced of this: many animals also have sensations.
But how could we verify that he feels the same when he behaves the same way we do?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to have proof of it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it until now just as we cannot prove that other human beings have a consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and address the issues of feeling or consciousness in general, we enter hard-to-reach terrain because the hardware doesn’t match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it kills, flees or attacks.
Human beings behave the same way, which is why some scientists deduce a comparable subjective experience.
However, I do not believe it.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make transposing our subjective experience to that of animals difficult.
One aspect is that the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the prefrontal lateral cortex (because of its participation in short-term memory and in the functions of direction and execution).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and appears to be entirely absent in other beings.
So at least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, among which the awareness of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being is even different from other primates.
Another significant peculiarity could lie in the linguistic nature of man: much of his existence being related to language, this often means that his consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness were not to depend on language, it would surely influence it, so that animal consciousness, no matter how it is produced, would probably differ a lot from most of our states of consciousness.
This is why it is also difficult to determine what consciousness can look like in other animals.
If this, both internal and subjective, is not measured or, because of this particular Hardware, analyzed based on our own experience, then its observation poses great problems for us.
Most of my developments refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is next to another aspect of consciousness that should be more easily accessible scientifically.
Animal consciousness processes could be examined without regard to their content, and this is exactly what has happened in studies on the short-term memory of primates, particularly with the example of visualization.
But in this approach that Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, we focus more on the nerve correlations of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both may or may not be identical.
Curiously, this approach also highlights the weight of the prefrontal cortex in the realization of visualization.
But what happens to the emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as that of fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
What we call “fear” is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, like the body’s reactions) grabs RAM.
Thus observed, emotions are closely related to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates and especially humans.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our fickle nature, emerge, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to impute them to others than ourselves.
Conversely, Antonio Damasio thinks that sensations from primitive activities are born in the areas of cortex and brainstem bodily sensation, as is Jaak Pankseep, who focuses more on the brainstem.
Since this network has not changed much over the course of human evolution, it could quite participate in transversal sensations of any kind.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict it, but I believe it indemonstrable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear in humans and rats is likely to be felt as fear in both cases: how, however, can one verify whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
A cockroach runs away from danger, but what if he feels fear?
In my opinion, similar behaviors are not enough to prove identical experiences.
Of course, the nerve comparison helps: rats and humans have similar brain trunks, while cockroaches do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem causing the sensations?
And even if we could prove it to man: how could we prove it to rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have sensations.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are likely to differ completely from ours (since human consciousness relies on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior than the emotional sensations of rats.
In all cases, progress is nerve-wrenching insofar as the same is measured in rats and humans.
Since I don’t explore the language and consciousness in rats, nor the sensations, I don’t know if they exist.
One might judge this to be short-term, but I’d rather move forward than constantly bump into a wall.
I am a pragmatic emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as a test of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise, in collaboration with Poland, the European Championships," Wasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
Work has just begun, and there is still a lot to do in both countries.”
In the schedule of the construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts run after deadlines.
The number of stadiums for the European Championship could eventually be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must work at maximum speed,” said Ukrainian League President Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA is constantly watching us."
An even more radical measure was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, an independent administrator.
The committee met at the request of Sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be “a real danger that the PZPN will not be able to act in accordance with the rules,” said Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP.
"We assured the UEFA President in a letter that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship would not suffer."
Several members of the Premier League had already been convicted in the previous season for manipulating mandatory relegation; in the end, the beginning of the League had even to be postponed at the last minute.
Dennis Quaid indignantly counterattacked
She wanted to promote for a new film, talked about her privacy in an interview - and is now in trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has lifted the veil on her ex-adult Dennis Quaid.
It foams - and counterattacks.
A Late Rose War for Ex-Couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors engage in a disgraceful battle - in everyone's sight and hearing.
Last week, Meg Ryan spoke in an interview with the American newspaper InStyle about the causes of the marriage failure: “Dennis has long been unfaithful to me, and it was very painful.”
She would have been aware of the extent of the deception only after the divorce.
The reason for this striptease of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - it tells the story of an adulteress.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his calling him an unfaithful husband was clear: It would be “Monstrous,” he told the 54-year-old “New York Daily News,” that “Meg once again cuddles the story of our relationship and manipulates it.”
It would also be “sorry” that “the pain and upheaval that a divorce entails for each child will once again be revived in public” for their 16-year-old common son Jack.
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and will soon become the father of twins.
So was his reply to the clap: "In any case, my life continues.
I’m happy to have a wonderful family that is doing its best.”
Airline and hotel ticket prices drop
In the first half of 2008, flights and hotel nights were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, thefts would even be reduced by up to 50 percent.
Hotel flights and nights would become advantageous again - this is the result of a study by financial and travel service provider American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and established, after a price increase in the first quarter, a sharp decline in profits in the second quarter.
After hotel prices rose for years, hotel nights have already fallen in many places.
From January to March, prices rose in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed by another 6.9 percent on average compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
The trend was clear especially in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all this would lie for American Express in the low dollar price that led to a “descending travel of American tourists.”
Financial hubs such as Frankfurt or London would be even more affected by falling hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices are holding with a 26.3 percent increase, the record in Europe.
Also in terms of flight prices, the trend was up in the first quarter:
As a result of the increase in the price of kerosene, economy-class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, long-haul flights, which were very fuel-consuming, even increased by 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, prices of economy class tickets fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, in business class and first class, however, price changes were significantly less pronounced.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices rose 11.9 percent, in the second quarter they fell 23.6 percent.
German domestic flights have even been halved according to this study.
The reasons for this fall in prices would be, on the one hand, weakening economic growth, the firm explains.
Demand would cede ground in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be increased competition pressure through the Open Skies Treaty, which liberalizes air traffic between the United States and Europe.
Sign of the tense situation is the removal by airlines of non-profitable journeys, as well as the high number of airlines that would have filed the balance sheet in the first half of 2008 - they were 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV Beat Gladbach 1:0
With a simple goal and methods, the SV Hamburg becomes the top of the rankings.
In Borussia, Luhukay has still not managed to find a functional eleven.
By Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Disaster landing for international player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player only returned late in the game and his shot failed against the goal frame.
His message was precisely worded, it had come out of his lips persuasively.
He just knew he was right.
“We need this second goal,” Hermann Rieger whistled in the hallway of the Hamburg Arena locker room.
There wasn’t much going on in the locker rooms, the half-time was over and most had satiated in their place.
Rieger has been the physiotherapist of HSV for nearly three decades, enjoying a great reputation as a former protagonist.
And that is why his request was received in the strategic places.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol acquiesced and raised his thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
Whose orders seem to have been similar: and let it jump with that second goal!
The practice was lacking.
“It wasn’t all very nice to see today,” Jansen later confessed.
Bastian Reinhard “would have liked to be more relaxed.”
This 1:0 (1:0 at half-time), the Hamburg team owes it to a successful header by Mladen Petric (in the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak Gladbach players could not hurt the weak Hamburg players.
“It was a dirty victory,” Marin Jol summed up.
The SV Hamburg will celebrate its 121th anniversary on Monday.
Already on Saturday afternoon, fans celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional leaderboards on the giant screen that indicated their club as first in class.
It's going to be a birthday without a real party.
“We know how to step back,” said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the intermediate result of the table reflects more the unpredictability of the First League than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its late-comers - Brazilians Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petric as well as FC Bayern's outspoken Jansen - is certainly slowly forming, but it's not shining yet.
“We need more charm and more dribbles,” Jol demanded.
After the Vote Failed
On Wall Street, fear is circulating.
The first news of the failure of the rescue plan temporarily dropped the Dow Jones by 700 points.
This was the biggest loss of points in a day in history.
Later, the Dow Jones caught up.
By 8:30 p.m., the world’s largest stock index was 10.579 points with a drop of well five percent.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange Index was at 1548 points with a drop of more than seven points.
The biggest losers of the Dow Jones were at that time American Express which lost nearly 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No stock could earn any more profits.
Bank Goldman Sachs shares saw a decline of nearly ten percent.
Only a few days ago, the great investor Warren Buffett had partnered with the company.
As part of the rescue plan, the means must be mobilized for the purchase of so-called spoiled mortgage papers.
However, the sum must not be paid at once, but gradually.
In return, the government should recover options on the shares of the financial company that may be exchanged in accordance with price developments in order to reduce the burden on the Treasury.
Stock prices aspired to in the whirlwind in Europe and the United States
The billions in aid for banks in Europe and the United States are no match for investor concerns.
The stock price of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and pulls the Dax to the bottom.
The U.S. Dow Jones Index is collapsing despite the state’s planned bailout of the financial market.
Dramatic drops in Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank prices have led the German index (Dax) to a deep deficit.
The stock of the Bavarian real estate financier has lost three-quarters of its value at the moment despite the rescue operation of the federal government and private banks, the Commerzbank has recorded a drop of more than 20 percent.
The Dax slid significantly below the important 6,000-point psychological bar and was down 5,839 points with a 3.7 percent deficit.
All over the world, stock markets have fallen to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government’s $700 billion bailout might not be enough to restart financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10,809.25 points lost in the first hour of opening 334 points or 3.3 percent.
The U.S. House of Representatives intended to vote on the bailout, the Senate vote is expected to follow on October 1.
Other European exchanges also saw only one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 index saw a decline of 3.2 percent for the time being, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan’s top Nikkei index fell to 11,743.61 points after an initial increase of 1.26 percent.

The multinational commercial and tourism company has also announced that the shares will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers in perplexity: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational support maneuvers.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not completely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has been flying in space.
Due to soon-frozen fuel lines, cryogenic death threatens it.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused confusion among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a manoeuvre of space probes, by which they obtain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example the Earth.
Thus, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Cassini-Huygens European-American research probe used this physical trick, as did the Ulysses solar probe.
This is what has surprised researchers for years: flying objects do not always behave 100 percent as expected according to the venerable laws of gravitation.
Moreover, irregularities appear at the speed level.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
Until now, physicists could not explain this effect.
They called it the anomaly of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes the attractive force of matter due to the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton still believes as hard as iron that Einstein was not mistaken and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support using what is called dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Dark matter could be responsible for this anomaly, matter that is also close to Earth," he wrote.
Space researchers have known about the existence of dark matter for only about ten years.
It apparently emanates from it a force of attraction whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
On the other hand, it is completely invisible, i.e. it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, dark matter would still account for a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days at the hands of their kidnappers, the kidnapped tourists in Egypt should be released, as confirmed by the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs.
The Sudanese kidnappers had demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the pre-liberation shooting, six hostages were reportedly killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were abducted.
Negotiations for the ransom would have already begun.
The Germans are constantly in the collimator of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE depicts the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are visibly free.
This is what the Egyptian state television, the Arab television channel Al-Arabija and the Italian media have communicated together.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the reports of the Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We are checking their health," Frattini said.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanians and their eight Egyptian companions are doing well and are safe, Egyptian national television announced.
The 19 participants of the desert tour should already be on their way to Cairo.
Circumstances surrounding a shooting before the hostages were released remain unclear: thus, the kidnappers would have been close to stopping the abduction, according to an Egyptian security official, before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers without shouting.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom,” the officer said.
All that remained was to collect the hostages,” when suddenly, “this surprise” occurred.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers shot six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and arrested two of them.
The hostages had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money had to be handed over by the German woman of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" said that, according to a German mediator, the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men had to be held until the kidnappers found a safe route to flee.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the story.
Abuse of a father-in-law "which led to suicide"
A court was informed that years of abuse by her father-in-law led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, was jailed for six years after admitting eight counts of indecent wrongdoing.
The Truro High Court ruled that he regularly linked his stepdaughter, Stephanie Randle, during her childhood, aged 5 to 7.
Trerise wrote in a confession letter: “I feel responsible for his death.”
The court was informed that Ms. Randle, 34, committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
As a child when she lived in Coventry, Trerise had tied her up and bandaged her before forcing her to sexual acts, while her mother was working in the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His daughter-in-law went to Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Ms. Randle, a regular National Trust volunteer, was haunted by the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had told him that Ms. Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, had seemed “emotionally dead” since 2006, and had “lost all hope for life.”
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that she committed suicide by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who had also written a confession letter that ended: "I attached and bandaged her regularly."
“I didn’t abuse her sexually.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: “You’re really weird as a fetishist, your victim certainly had to be terrified, especially at the age of 7.
“This unpleasant saga ended with the victim’s suicide.
And what’s even more amazing is the fact that if she hadn’t done that, her story would certainly never have ended in court.”
He added: “I particularly stress, as his father and mother describe him, the effects of your crime committed for years on Stephanie.
"Without these, she would probably be a happy, promising, successful young woman today."
Conviction for loss of official data.
The Cabinet Office ministerial officer who forgot top secret documents on a train in June will be convicted by the Official Secrets Act, the BBC said.
The Defense Department man was on the move when he forgot two highly classified documents, on a train heading to Waterloo.
The documents were passed into the hands of the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said that this episode had a lot of people from Whitehall.
"They will have thought that this case would have remained between the walls of the Ministry of Defense and the Office," he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed is accused of a violation of section 8.1 of the act, that is, of the clause that deals with the safeguarding of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the ministerial officer be placed under the supervision of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of his work related to the Associated Committee of the Secret Services.
The documents he lost contained assessments of al-Qaeda as well as the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was then transported from his home to a secret location.
Building companies facing the B&B invoice.
British construction companies may have to pay an invoice of more than $80 million to cover the bailout of Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The Government has provided $14 billion to protect the deposits of the 2.6 million Bradford & Bingleys savers.
Interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that collect money from the savers, including 59 building companies.
Building Societies Association (BSA) CEO Adrian Coles said it was “irritating” to know that companies and their members will have to pay the broken pots...
The $14 billion loan will be repaid when Bradford & Bingleys mortgages are released.
But the interest that will increase at the same time will be debited, every year, to the 700 financial companies that collect the deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the building’s 59 companies are included in this list.
It’s annoying to see that institutions that have behaved cautiously... now have to pay some of the institutions’ bills that were much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is proclaimed that each company must pay a proportionate sum to the deposits it holds, and that intermediary companies must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan in 2009 will be $450 million.
This means that companies will have to find $81 million to settle interest for the first year.
Adrian Coles, director general of the commercial committee of building companies, told the BBC that this decision seemed unfair to him.
It’s “irritating” to see that institutions that have behaved cautiously during the recovery of the real estate market now have to pay for much less cautious institutions.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, the date of the first annals.
“We need to look at every aspect of this case over the next few weeks, to assess the options to be adopted to prevent building companies and their members from paying this salty bill,” Cole said.
Interest for 2009 covers seven months, from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010, interest for the whole year will have to be paid, which could more than double.
Since building companies are non-shareholder organizations, their members end up paying the bill either with higher charges, or with lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Milk increases up to five pennies per liter
The people of Jersey must pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy announced that it would increase the wholesale price of its milk, by five pence per liter, starting Monday.
This is the second price increase that follows a two-pence increase in February, following a search by a consulting firm.
Retailers must decide whether they will go in turn, raising the price to consumers.
. Prior to the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk had last changed, in 2002.
Former PM of Bangladesh denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a request for bail from former PM Sheikh Hasina, who is in danger of being arrested on his return.
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her bail because of her prosecution for extorting from a businessman $50 million Taka ($729.000.00) when she was a PM.
This case is one of the many charges brought against him.
Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina’s longtime rival, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in a few weeks, but his party, the Awani League, has demanded that the country’s provisional military government first give him full freedom.
Correspondents pointed out that the terms of her release are contradictory because if she is allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they do not see why she could not remain free upon her return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers have announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
“The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina’s request saying she does not require bail as she had been allowed to go abroad for medical reasons,” his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
"We will appeal against the order of the Supreme Court."
Her lawyers argued that she needed this bail to return to the country in preparation for the elections in December.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after Oct. 17, a former leader of the Awami party said.
She was detained last year after the interim military government took power, but was released in June for treatment abroad.
Sheikh Hasina as Zhaleda Zia, deny the accusations against them.
Concerns about the Afghan anti-polio campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have missed the recent polio immunization campaign, due to Taliban-related violence, the United Nations said.
Last week, the United Nations conducted a vaccination campaign in all six provinces.
But she says she is not able to contact children in the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, located to the south.
A U.N. spokeswoman said this happened despite promises by the Taliban not to attack or obstruct the thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB loses the ITV court battle
BSkyB lost its trial following the Competition Commission's verdict, which would force it to reduce its stake in its rival ITV transmitter.
The Competition Appeal Court ordered BSkyB to reduce its ITV shares from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The commission said that in the past, MSkyB’s involvement had prevented competition and allowed it to unfairly influence ITV.
BSkyB bought its shares in 2006 following a deal to actually prevent NTL, now called Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Bureau reported that BSkyB's purchase of ITV shares raised doubts about ITV's effective independence, prompting the Competition Commission to investigate the issue.
Virgin’s boss, Richard Branson, a consumer group, and the Ofcom regulator were all against the purchase.
BSkyB retorted that forcing it to reduce its ITV shares would not be reasonable and on the contrary was excessive – especially given that BSkyB has just given up its voting rights.
A new investigation into the U.S. prosecutors' case.
The U.S. attorney general appointed a special prosecutor to verify the issue of the dismissal of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
It all stemmed from the report of the Justice Department Inspector General's case, which criticized the actions of some ministerial officers.
The report was critical of White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers who argue that their dismissal is due to political causes.
Special Counsel Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers questioned during the investigation lied to the investigators, obstructing justice.
"Serious allegations of potentially criminal conduct, unfounded, have not been fully confirmed or resolved," Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special accuser capable of forcing witnesses to testify was one of his greatest recommendations.
The dispute began with the dismissal in December 2006 of nine U.S. prosecutors from the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the department said prosecutors were fired for poor performance.
But then it emerged that the dismissed prosecutors were no more criticized than their other colleagues, prompting some observers to give these dismissals a political connotation.
Some of the prosecutors have been accused of being close to Congressional Republicans, while others have reportedly refused to investigate charges of fraudulently voting against Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are investigating and prosecuting court cases for the government.
It is certain that they can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, ended up accused of being involved in this dismissal case, and in the end, he resigned.
A number of Department of Justice ministerial officers have also resigned.
The Inspector General’s report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales’ role in this case, stating that he considered him “first responsible” for these layoffs, and ended up “abdicating” his leadership role, “remarkably succeeding in not being involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including former Bush aide Karl Rove, were criticized for failing to cooperate during the investigation.
The epic of Meat Loaf will be honored.
Rock star Meat Loaf, to be honored at the Q Awards for her epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an Oscar at the ceremony in London next week, said he was "honoured" to get that recognition.
The nine-minute, fifty-second song was the title track of the 1977 Meat Loaf album.
The awards night is presented by Coldplay, with this year’s selection limited to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: “There are songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell certainly does.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a big voice like that of Meat Loaf.
It begins with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK as a single in 1979, ranking 15th.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell remained nine years in the English charts, and was sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf – or Marvin Lee Aday, by his real name – has suffered from a medical condition in recent years, even undergoing surgery to cure his irregular heartbeat after collapsing on stage in 2003.
In 2007, a strong laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Then a cyst was found in the vocal cords.
A dark street in the city, often forgotten, and may soon be for sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, others only functional.
. And even some veteran taxis as well as long-time local residents do not know how to give directions to get to Extra Place, because they have never heard of it.
The street is located in the East Village and runs north of First Street- not to be confused with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
Approximately 30 feet wide by 120 feet long, it looks like a dusty driveway rather than an active artery.
. No signs indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
However, this street has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the builder of the recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to repay Extra Place, and create a smoother passage to stores and shops, which are expected to open in new buildings.
Other admirers, including longtime neighbors, said they were charmed by this shortcut simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets on the block.
But the City’s Preservation and Real Estate Development Department, which runs the street, has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of the Neighborhood Owners' Committees, representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal authorizing the real estate builder to buy the street.
But the committee prefers the street to remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new proposal to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the committee’s local manager.
"There are only a few spaces left in the city, and we would like the city to retain Extra Place," she said.
"They could offer to rehabilitate and manage it, which Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public."
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that it wanted to renovate the small street and install seats there, some of which would be used by a cafe to which the builder will grant the space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at this month’s meeting.
Avalon Bay spokesman Michele de Milly said that while the company wants to operate the street, it doesn’t necessarily mean it wants to own it.
"Avalon Bay's main interest is to relook this abandoned driveway, and make it public," she said, noting that it was the city that suggested the sale to her.
Seth Donlin, a spokeswoman for the Preservation of Real Estate, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street, stressing further that the agency’s mission was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical footprint.
Some believe that Extra Place has been named after him since 1802, when the legacy of Philip Minthorne's many children's farm was divided, leaving aside this small piece of land, which has since been abandoned.
The rear entrance of the CBGB, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, reopened at Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the cover photo of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"This place was beautiful," said Ramones manager Danny Fields, who took the picture in November 1976.
It was full of scrap, rags, barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who had already talked about the East Village’s evolution to luxury, objected to the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble little property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place a real rarity – a fragment virtually identical to the city that should be put in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Contests: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Extinction Process") tells the story of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small narrow cul-de-sac, dark day and night, and bounded by the doors of a rusty iron warehouse and shutters, full of newspapers from last week flying along the gutters."
With few exceptions, the street always looks the same.
A rat runs smoothly at the back of the alley, near a door that once led to the CBGB, and which has now become the headquarters of a chic clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls, an empty 22 ounce bottle of beer, rests next to newspapers that have just been thrown away.
A few passersby said they rarely think of Extra Place, and suggested its enhancement.
Field, on the other hand, said he thought some underestimated the attractiveness of the street in its current state.
“The best years of my life,” he said, “have taken place in dark, wet, disgusting places.”
The Bilingual Debate: Immersion in the English Language
In this part of the Education Supervision program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates about bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former member of studies in California, and former director of the department of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book “Not as Good as You Thought. Why Middle Classes Must Be Able to Choose Their School.”
Attracting the favors of Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama’s proposals on education are an interesting example.
Obama’s campaign points out that “African American and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students.”
To combat these differences, Mr. Obama’s education program supports, in particular, “two-language transitional education” for those who learn English.
However, the question for Obama is whether his desire to pursue bilingual education that advocates non-English language classroom instruction goes beyond his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
The students of this school are mostly Hispanic, and low-income.
More than a third of the students, many of them newcomers, study English.
Among CM1 students, 100% passed the 2008 State Maths Exam, expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students passed the English-languages-of-arts exam
This incredible success was achieved thanks to another ingredient than the one put forward by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street relies on analysis, practice, a constant assessment of capabilities and an exemplary attitude.
In addition, and here is an example that Mr. Obama could copy, reports Linda Mikels, principal of Sixth Street, this school has instituted the instruction of the English language "full immersion".
Total immersion in English focuses on the almost constant use of English in instruction.
Ms. Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, told me "we had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you went without his class, you wouldn't have had a chance to identify him."
"It works," she observes, "it worked for us."
Shouldn’t Obama take the example of the Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in other schools made up mostly of Hispanic students learning English.
The excellent results achieved by this school speak for themselves; but the policies on education within his party (the National Education Associations have long supported bilingual education) and his enormous support for bilingual education obscure the prognosis of Mr. Obama’s response.
Although he is supportive of the fact that immigrants learn English, Mr. Obama recently considered this issue insignificant, when he proclaimed that we must all stop debating the wording of the laws in the English language.
“On the contrary,” he said, “you have to make sure that your child speaks Spanish.”
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, then he should carefully consider the models of education that work, rather than scorning them or considering them as insignificant.
Clean Oil Fall Following the New Concerns of the Economy World
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday as people fear that the bailout for the financial markets will succeed in bringing the economy back to life.
Crude oil futures fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel, the New York Mercantile Exchange, during sales this morning.
Prices have fallen more than $20 a barrel since Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by financial turmoil on Wall Street, as well as two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After an increase of $145.29 a barrel in July, prices fell to nearly $90 a barrel this month, before rebounding again in view of deep financial market uncertainties.
Investors are worried again on Monday despite the deal on the biggest bailout in history, reached this weekend by congressional leaders.
The news has been mitigated by recent concerns that the crisis will last.
In the latest episode of this financial disaster, Citygroup will purchase the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourgish governments have nationalized the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said this weekend’s frantic negotiations with the bailout deal “appear to have failed to revive the market.”
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to slow.
“The outlook for global equity, interest rates and market exchange has become uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a letter to investors.
"We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape this contagion.
“As far as raw materials are concerned, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the American virus would spread globally, and in particular, to China.”
Bank analysts cut expectations for next year, as oil consumption fell due to slowing economic growth, and were forced to drop by 20 percent as oil and gas prices forecasts for 2009.
The Second Time Determining Party for the Improvement of the Team Record.
After spending the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in the Shaun Ellis Jets uniform, the defender thought he had seen it all.
He was watching the second half, when the Jets turned a 0-0 into an explosion.
“I’ve never seen anything like that,” Ellis said.
The second half began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals played saline under dark clouds.
Then quarterback Brett Favre managed to make a pass at Laveranues Coles allowing a touchdown of 12 yards, a precursor to an afternoon during which their relationship made a leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns, the first when a corner back fell and the second, 10 seconds into the half.
"I didn't get out of my area," Favre said of all his passes to Coles.
"He's a mediocre player."
“We communicate extremely well, despite what people think.”
While Favre and Coles were playing catch, the defense beat the Cardinals' quarterback, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a lost shot and made 32 yards to the touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted her.
Linebacker, David Bowens dropped the ball because of Warner.
At the last change, the loss of the Bowens ball, may well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of this possession for the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely scored a 20-yard goal taking a 34-to-0 lead.
It was the best the Jets could score in a while.
Jets coach Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness, said "the second half or the third?"
When told about the two--the Jets missed 21 unchallenged points in the third half--Mangini said: "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second half more than the third.
"A lot of points were scored in a short time."
Gebrselassie rested, surpasses his world record.
Haile Gebrselassie, an Ethiopian, once again proved worthy of his title as the best cross-country runner of the century, having broken his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win in 2:03:59 of an accommodating race on the plate, Gebrselassie beat his record of 2:04:26, held last year in Berlin, by 27 seconds.
At 35, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record in his superb career during which he won the world championship or the world record for any distance, from the marathon’s 1600 meters.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing - perhaps exaggerated in today's eyes - that air pollution would increase his asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions- sunny weather, 48 degrees at the start, 55 at the finish- Gebrselassie won Sunday, now an impressive average of a mile in 4 minutes 43 seconds
Track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, converted to cross-country runners, have contributed to the marathon record drop of more than two minutes in the last decade, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2:06:05.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters, having suffered calf cramps two weeks earlier, and missed training for a week.
It is obvious that the rest allowed him to remain bright, but not rusty.
“I’m so happy,” he told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I got back to it last week, and today I had doubts; but in the end, everything went for the better."
He was blamed – especially in Kenya, the rival is Ethiopia’s African – for having too much orchestration of his races, avoiding the world stars of the marathon, relying on hares as if they were in a track competition, and considering more world records than the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish Gebrselassie’s greatness as a cross-country runner.
Gebrselassie Sunday, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04. on my way.
Two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the leaders disappeared.
Just over three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made his final comeback to break away from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his best five-minute personal record.
Kamathis is third in 2:07:48.
In the women’s race, Kazakhstan-born Irina Mikitenko, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year getting the seventh time of 2:19:19.
England’s Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone by winning the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She was unable to participate in the Beijing Games because of a hypothetical back injury, but promised to win in Berlin, improving in her third marathon, her personal record of almost five minutes.
She ran using skillful strategy, letting the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners take a handsome lead, then overtaking them about 18 miles 1/2 later.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia came second at 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenyan, finished third at 2:25:01.
In a Town in Part, Pride and the Trials of the Black Life
Hidden in the development of its huge park, a few miles from the sunny, bright and giant Orlando, lies a quiet little town where pride and complications of the African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first entirely black town to be integrated, Zora Neale Hurston's childhood home, this description she made in 1935, is no longer so simple to make these days." The city has five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of guavas, two schools and no prison."
It has now become a pilgrimage city.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora Festival in Eatonville to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in a variety of ways, the city she describes has become a tourist city thanks to its inclusion in the Florida tour guide edited by The Depression-Era Federal Writers' Project- remains a place of its own.
She is as independent, dignified, and private as she was in the 1930s, when Hurston said that Florida’s black rural population was often reluctant to share her true thoughts with the white man, who “knows us so little, doesn’t know what he’s losing.”
Even though this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has invoked an open dialogue on the theme of race, many here remain cautious of the look of the foreigner.
“We are very careful about how to tell the story,” said Hortense Jones, 59, a longtime resident and the oldest parishioner in the city.
"It must be in accordance with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and battle.
It represents both a historical model of a black takeover and a community of nearly 2,400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a central point but also an example of southern black rural culture – sometimes scorned, sometimes hailed – that recalls the birth of American slavery.
Which would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
Interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through sincere, dialect-filled books such as Mules and Men (1935) and Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide transformed this city, located just off Route 17, a road that crosses the often forgotten center of Florida, which ends in a chapter of black history and human drama.
Bold as a coffer in life as in literature, Hurston led readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Mr. Joe Clarke, who was later divided into several private parts.
“You’ll find the modern public school in brown and white, with its well-preserved gardens and playgrounds that Howard Miller has always taken care of, though he barely knows how to read and write.
She also mentioned Widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds as well as anything that can be used for people passing by.
So, in just a hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with self-government but also illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor wasn’t like that.
It wasn’t actually a portrait that everyone liked.
Zora described the reality well,” said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson’s young girls whom Hurston immortalized, citing the colorless songs, performed by men who praised their beauty.
She added: “Some people didn’t like it.”
Hurston is still remembered as a lively and eccentric person, who returned frequently after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston usually arrived in town without warning, in a big Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wearing pants here, where even today, we are proud of traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many were making fun of her.
“People were always happy to see Zora,” he said.
But he added, swinging in his chair from the back patio overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "she never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten it.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in some grave in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no great commemorations, no plaques for the general public.
I don’t think they understood the contribution or legacy it offered to the world,” said Valerie Boyd, author of “Wrapped in Rainbows,” a 2003 Hurston biography.
A crucial moment occurred in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to move a five-lane highway into town, replacing Kennedy Boulevard, the community's main two-lane street.
The development of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 to the western corner of the city.
The proposal was made as Eatonville recovered from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among many other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the race-mixing dispute led to hatred at the doors of the community.
"At that time, a bunch of young white men were throwing oranges or objects at people sitting on the side," Franklin said.
“A woman has even died.”
They threw a watermelon out of their car.”
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston casts doubt on the Supreme Court’s request for forced integration, defining its decision in Brown v. Board of Education as “insulting rather than glorifying my race.”
Residents now claim that eliminating racial segregation in schools, while positive in some respects, has diluted Eatonville's cohesion and weakened youth confidence.
"Black children used to be kissed - I remember - our master was kissed in the morning, and so was the evening," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and chief executive officer of the Eatonville Community Safeguards, a nonprofit group.
It lasted, she added, until the teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
“You don’t kiss your white teacher because he’s white – I mean there’s a cultural line here,” Nathiri said.
Civil rights, moreover, have created space for many more Zora Neale Hurston-black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond harm, such as herself, armed with joyful self-confidence and such guidelines as: "How can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company!"
It's beyond me."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker visited Hurston's anonymous tomb and began struggling to revive her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography about Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, a true bestseller, reintroduced it to American guns.
The highway project came just as Eatonville’s most famous girl had regained her appeal.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors consider her a savior.
The community began hosting a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences of this highway.
Hundreds of fans came to the festival’s inauguration two years later, and many return in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the county pushed back the highway proposal.
"The fiasco of the five-lane highway, extremely fast, a real civic pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd summed it all up by stating that "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been listed as a historic city since 1998.
A single-theme library (of course renamed Hurston) opened in 2006 on a beautiful refurbished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: six miles from Orlando, it can at any time be considered as a back street on a summer rainy day, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(There are now 90 percent black people.)
Foreigners who come to discover the history of Eatonville, his raison d'etre, are still treated with caution.
Permission must be sought for most interviews, and certain things--such as the walls of the old church of Eatonville, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields--should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a courageous teacher who has a soft spot for bright red, are always afraid that their island community will be well understood.
However, given the expansion of the Hurston festival, a certain level of local pride emerged.
Young people in particular tend to view Eatonville as his whole race: beautiful, problematic and everything, neither better nor worse, but as proud, creative, bossy, crazy and mixed as other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is the sincere civic affection that is heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or for the police forces, who need additional forces.
And even for the younger ones, like Alondra and 11-year-old Alexia Kenon, twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned the Eatonville description correctly.
"Most people, who pass through that area, will think, 'Oh, this city has nothing compared to others,'" Alondra Kenon said after Mass last Sunday.
But if you stop and take the time to contemplate history, it’s a very beautiful city.”
Here in New York, everyone speaks finance fluently.
Still, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the kiosk and giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t realize they’re in the eye of the cyclone.
Never could they think that in the glass and honeycomb offices above their heads, bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York, spend the worst “work day at the office” since the 1929 crack.
Deliverers continue to sneak on the sidewalks, with their carts and muffin trays for morning meetings.
Latinos still hang between residential buildings carrying, like mules, about fifty luxurious shirts hanging from a yoke placed on his shoulders.
Office workers continue to queue to buy their morning sandwiches from street vendors, and it’s still impossible to find a taxi between 4pm and 7pm on weekdays.
I hadn’t felt the crisis in spite of the completely pessimistic stories until this afternoon when I decided to go and open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I had planned to work late in the afternoon, as I was discovering at my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, about 20 people queuing.
Not in front of cashier counters, not to withdraw cash or make a payment, but in front of the customer service counter, where regular customers ordered their checkbooks, tourists asked for direction for the Macy store, and new customers opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me would later learn from Starr, my “authorized personal banker,” all queued up for the same reason I did.
Not the same way, because they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, like those in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They have withdrawn their money from savings accounts called thritts (such as a building company), credit unions, and the type of local savings banks and their subsidiaries that only operate in one state, and that claim to treat customers like their families.
In the past, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 capital, has turned to the bankruptcy trustee, and as New Yorkers were coming home for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 million in savings accounts, was desperately looking for a buyer to save her.
The office and the store employees in front of me, frightened by another potential debacle, have transferred their money to a bank that seems reliable, the one that makes the most bailout on Wall Street.
Any New Yorkers have become very familiar with the world of finance in recent weeks.
“I was hearing a lady at my local Chinese supermarket talking on the phone about Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and its meager CEO Dick Fuld, as familiar as she might have been to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed concierge in my building, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or the deliveries from my fruit and vegetable dealer.
She told me, following my visit to the bank. "I put all my savings into the money market.
“I’ve changed, I don’t want to take risks.”
Muslim tombs profaned as Austria swings to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who has abandoned the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and , Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right wing Vlaams Belang, are taking part in a demonstration to present the organization of "cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry road signs illustrating red-striped mosques.
Police accuse far-right extremists of desecrating an Austrian Muslim cemetery on the weekend of the victory of far-right political parties in the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at Traun Cemetery near Linz between Friday night and this morning, according to police, an organized action.
Criminals have painted Jewish symbols such as the Star of David on several graves, but detectives believe this could have been done to disguise extremists’ hatred of Muslim immigrants.
This incident could be related to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said it was "deeply shocked" by the announcement of the desecration, which comes just during the religious month of Ramadan, which is nearing its end.
Austria is serious about regaining its courage, following its swing to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that garnered nearly 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, ran an anti-immigration campaign. Some of their slogans were even considered, according to critics, to be xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, led his campaign against wearing scarves and burkas, and even voiced his opposition to alaha food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European fraternity" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties tried to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, proclaiming that they would constitute a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out just after the elections, defined the far right as the strongest political bloc in the country, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference because they were worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is not allowed to travel abroad.
Courts have banned glamorous rock star Gary Glitter, accused of child sexual abuse, expatriation to France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter, after he expressed to the authorities that controlled him, his intention to travel to Spain via France.
Police in Kent issued the travel ban last Thursday after proving Glitter guilty to child sexual abuse.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the court hearing in Ashford, but was nonetheless represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the court said “Thursday, September 25, in the Ashford court, Kent police requested an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from traveling to France and Spain until March 25.
“Paul Gadd wasn’t there then.”
Glitter, 64, informed authorities that he wanted to go abroad, even if he was registered on the list of accused of sexual abuse.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police 7 days before his scheduled departure date.
If he does not report his movements to the authorities, he could serve up to five years in prison.
Kent police said they would not discuss specific cases or Glitter’s potential displacement in the counties.
A spokeswoman for the Kent Police said: “Kent Police will do everything necessary to protect our children as well as those from abroad.
"In our opinion, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because we have devices that can manage any potential risks, much more effectively.
“Protecting the people of Kent is the most cherished intention of the Kent Police, and we closely monitor the behavior of those accused of sexual abuse in the area, in order to minimize potential risks to the public.”
Glitter returned to the UK last month after serving 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls, respectively, aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok from where he would have to board a flight to London.
But he said he did not feel well, and refused to leave for London.
The Thai authorities blocked him from passport control, and in the end, he left for Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities denied him entry into their territory, and he was forced to return to Bangkok; Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Heathrow Airport Terminal 3 on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to the limited court in Uxbridge, West London, to register him on the list of people accused of sexual abuse, as Scotland Yard requires.
In the past, Glitter had previously served a four-month sentence in the United Kingdom, for holding images of child abuse.
A source at the interior ministry said Jacqui Smith, the interior minister, was reassured and pleased to learn that Glitter had been banned from travel to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master off-stage to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer
No heels, no stitching clothes.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, freed from all tensions to obtain the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in those moments unknown to the general public, where we discover to intimate gestures and stolen looks of artists who do not care to go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer mixes in "Flamenco - people" the theatricality of some stagings with singers, dancers and guitarists with this side less known to artists.
In this project, the photographer takes the particular iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the Flemish Photography Month program, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, which is growing every day," explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco - people" "can be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed “in the street” are artists capable of conveying on stage passion, sadness, joy ... by captivating the audience.
To capture moments of personality of these artists you do not have to take pictures on stage.
They have a personality and a character of their own.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that allowed me to capture with the camera the personality moments of the flamenco stars.”
With the "Song of Mines" festival, Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and equipment, recall classic photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classical side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day".
It is not about the dance or the song itself, but about the personality and character of the artist who captivates the audience with his art.
The search for the essentials and magic has been the constant of this work that is presented these days at the El Fotómata gallery.
The flamenco stars like Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about seventy photographed artists.
The project has transformed into an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a collection book of the portraits exhibited at the gallery.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of Old Athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves photographing people's portraits, getting to know them and being able to enter their lives for a more or less long moment.
I believe that in photography portraiture is the most difficult genre.
You find yourself in front of people, characters that sometimes you don’t know or that leave you only a few minutes to be able to take a photo of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true.”
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco, called "Flamenco - people", is on display at Galerie El Fotómata, located at number 20 in rue de la Mata (street parallel to the Herculean People's Market), which will be open until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa says the novel he writes is "truly audacious"
The novel takes place in places nobody knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to advance the new project he is working on, a novel whose main character is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and who has passed through the Amazon.
The Nobel Prize in Literature favourite confessed yesterday at the Hay festival Segovia, that the novel that currently occupies it "is a real audacity" and that "everything demonstrates that he should not write it".
“If I were reasonable, I wouldn’t do it, but I’m going to do it and I hope to finish it,” he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas and thoughts that for four days saw a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people parade through the aqueduct city.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was the most anticipated character of the third edition of this festival and fulfilled his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award by the majority of the participants’ votes, made a full room at the Juan Bravo Theater.
The presenter of the Festival, Felix Romeo, found himself faced with a fascinated audience who did not see the past memory of Alexander, how the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with a great dose of humour, traced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "his thirst to read" and "to live new experiences"; how he wrote from a very
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change lives. "But I refuse to believe that literature is a pure fun, an ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people less frivolous", because they have been asked to go to the writers' homes.
Bad weather spoils the Pozoblanco fair
The banderilla party that concluded the bullfights at the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after horse-riding bullfighters verified that the arena was impassable.
In this way, the organizing committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Léonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bull race.
The bad weather was hard on this fair, since in the end two out of three parties could not take place.
Saturday was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second bull race planned.
The poster featured José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who should have competed in the Castilblanco arena.
So only the Friday party took place.
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and was carried in triumph, after making arm movements in front of the bull with taste and aesthetics.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante concluded on two banners planted on the back of the bull and a cut ear that the uncovered stands applauded more than his own struggle with the bull.
Even worse for El Juli, who entered the arenas of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
In his fight with the second bull, after a much better fight, he was whistled by most of the public.
Police check on van in Alava province: two thousand kilos of hashish found
5 a.m. minus 10 a.m.
Traffic control of the Euskadi police (Ertzaintza) on the border of the Municipality of Armiñón (Alava).
Police officers arrest two occupants of a van and the latter begin the flight.
Its loading, more than two tons of hashish, to stop them.
The police pursued them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A.A.J., according to information released by the Basque Government Department of Interior.
The arrested individual was charged with drug trafficking and forgery of documents.
The incident took place when various officials of the Alava Traffic Unit were carrying out a vehicle check on the N-1, on the border of the Municipality of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed orders, abruptly accelerated and control began.
The police began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometers further down the side, where the two occupants descended to flee into a wooded area.
The Basque police eventually arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hash balls and then transferred to a police station for a thorough inspection and to weigh the drugs.
In addition, the officials found that the license plate had been "forged" since it did not coincide with the one written on the grey card of the van, which is also why they charged the detainee with a crime of forgery of documents.
The Ertzaintza continues its investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to escape and to determine the source of the drug seized.
The detainee, 28-year-old A. A. J., has been placed in custody to carry out the various procedures and will be tried within hours.
Actress Heather Locklear Arrested for Driving on Drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda of the TV series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of a drug.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers while trying to get out of her garage in Montecito, according to a spokesman for the California police patrol revealed to People magazine.
The witness said that around 4:30 p.m., Locklear “pressed the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and going back several times, she drove on her sunglasses.”
Shortly after, the witness, who initially did not recognize the actress, saw that Locklear stopped in the middle of the highway and got out of his vehicle.
That person, at the time, called the emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
“She looked disoriented,” which is why the agents took her to the drug and alcohol center for a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and the alcohol abuse was ruled out from the start, although “according to police officers’ observation at first sight, we thought Locklear was under the influence of a drug.”
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the effect of an unspecified substance and was incarcerated around 7 p.m. and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left the Arizona clinic where she was interned to treat a nervous breakdown.
Llamazares asked the Andalusian federation of the United Left to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The General Coordinator and MP for the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it is the regional federation that makes a decision on the case of the former councillor for Youth and Sports of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of performing favored treatments to members of his family.
"In these cases, I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," Llamazares said regarding the behavior of the political party that he will have to adopt in the Seville City Council.
However, the leader of the United Left called for the investigations to show “transparency” for the irregularities that Silva could have committed: “The United Left has always defended this type of case so that they have a maximum degree of transparency.”
He also stressed that the political party has "very strict ethical codes for all officials".
"Sangre de Mayo", the daring bet of Garci
Inspired by the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous battle of the Spaniards against the French in "Sangre de mayo", which is the most ambitious film of his filmography with almost 15 million euros in budget.
The filmmaker tried "to stage the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" that he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of actors.
The two-and-a-half-hour film, Sangre de mayo, will be released in theaters next Friday, which will later become a TV series for Telemadrid for more than four hours.
A great admirer of Galdós' literature, José Luis Garci assures that with this filming he realized "a childhood dream" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who three years ago commissioned him to shoot a commemorative film for the two hundredth anniversary of May 2 in Madrid, something he always accepted when the narrative stuck to national historical facts.
The €15 million provided by the Madrid Commune constitutes a “unique opportunity” for Garci to reproduce with the appropriate decorations and clothing the atmosphere of “a Spain that was mistaken as leader for the fight, since the struggle for independence led the people to rebellions during the reign of Ferdinand VII,” he said.
But the filmmaker regrets not having obtained funding as for the films "Captain Alatriste" or "The Ghosts of Goya" - more than double that obtained for "Sangre de mayo" - because he could not shoot a few scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he collaborated for almost his entire career.
The filmmaker of "Volvera a starter" influenced his usual way of working, the staging of the actors, with whom he is used to rehearsing before starting the shoot and to whom he does not cast, since this seems "humiliating" and considers that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theater and the cinema to keep informed".
Many actors in "Blood of Mayo" repeat in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four-time Oscar nominee (he won one), Garci considers that the three films that represented Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy, “Sangre de mayo,” “Seven French Billiard Tables” and finally the winner, “Blind Sunflowers,” are not representative of young Spanish cinema, “which would deserve to be better known,” he said.
With this film Garci does not expect a price.
“At first you think you work for posterity, then you realize that you work only for prosperity, and now you just make one more movie,” Garci says after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayón puts herself in the shoes of the Sevillan dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Sevillian dancer will pay tribute to an equally Sevillian dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the district of Triana and at the age of three she went to live in London with her family.
She was a free dancer and specialist in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, pioneering the liberation of women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked the history of dance in Europe between the two wars fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and the latter offered me to play the Sevillan dancer Tórtola Valencia and it seemed incredible to me.”
According to the dancer, "we are not trying to tell her life but to translate her way of thinking.
The titles of his dances reminded me of flamenco.
Thus, "the dance of the butterfly" reminded me of a Cuban popular dance and "the dance of the snake" to some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me my way of dancing was identical to hers,” she says.
The staging was made thanks to two remarkable contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing Isabela again in one of his shows, as he had done in "La puerta aperta"; and that of Professor Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with the one who was his student.
"Matilde turns Tortola into a mature character.
I’m happy because she agreed to play a role in my work and it honors me.”
The staging was also done thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, to the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Morón; to the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as to the viola of Rafa El Viola and to the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who played the role of this genre of artist".
This work also tells, in a way, the life of this woman who exhibited herself in places so far away, especially for the time, such as in India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she usually resided in London.
"I wanted to remember her because I think it's these women who have a huge influence in their time and now nobody knows and highlights her work," Bayón said.
The show will start at 8.30 pm at the Lope de Vega Theater
The publication of the "Journal of a newly married poet" concludes the Triennat
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Journal of a Poet Recently Married" in St. Stephen's Church in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón's Celebration of the Celebration".
In this way, the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the reissue of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: This poplar of light" that was inaugurated last May and that, after having travelled through the different provinces of New York International in iralo
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia purchased eight hundred copies of the "Journal of a newly married poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the most famous Andalusian poets.
America likes it less without Paul Newman.
"Sometimes God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was one of them.”
This sentence is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him on “Absence of Malice,” and it illustrates the despair of American cinema, and of all America, at the striking idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
He struggled to get an Oscar.
It hasn’t turned since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
It was a hard blow for everyone.
“Sometimes what one feels is beyond expression, and now I have lost a great friend,” Robert Redford cried, “my life and my country were better because of his existence.”
No one was afraid of making themselves ridiculous or exaggerating.
One of the fathers of cinema and homeland died during a particularly dark period, when terrorists and stock markets are frightening, the esteem of Americans has fallen very low, desperately looking for reasons of dignity.
When times are so hard and without reason to live, it is left to human beings only admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He embodied for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of lost and defeated causes, such as the Foundation for Drug Fighting created in honor of his eldest who died following an overdose and the creation of his own organic food brand.
It was a victory for a country that struggled to win against a suicidal food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration swept through Hollywood without paying attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, has found that no James Bond has died before him.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning Sam Mendes, said working with Newman marked the pinnacle of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
“He set the bar high for us,” said George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one today who tries to break through the screen like Paul Newman did: by being very honest and having a serious privacy and away from goals.
It’s still not easy or possible in the media jungle these days.
But there is one who tries, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was loyal even if the opportunities were not lacking for not being so.
"But why should I eat a hamburger out of my house if I have a steak in my fridge?" he used to joke.
In heaven, he proudly watches his daughters meet their fans on earth, something not so common in America.
“Among all the great roles he has played, he has never been more proud than that of the devoted husband, the loving father, the caring grandfather and philanthropist,” he said.
Madrid in the race to organize the 2016 Olympic Games
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can host Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, this could be realized in 2016.
I wonder if we are ready.
If we take the example of yesterday’s race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but in my opinion it was the worst race I’ve ever raced.
If they had taken into account all the errors that occurred during the race, they would be the subject of a playoff note.
But let’s examine everything in detail and from the beginning.
Mistakes begin with the removal of the backs, which forces you to go ahead.
This is not bad but if they make you move it would be better if they gave you everything (including the electronic chip for racing).
Well, no.
They made you go there only to take the backpack (first mistake, move only for that) and (after a long queue) surprise!, there was only the size 'S' for the jersey (second mistake, because I need a size XL)
In what world do we live?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy only small jerseys with less fabric and therefore cheaper?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on race day.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to remove the electronic chip, the queue is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave your backpack at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, this is incomprehensible given that 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long queue, the competitions started and we had not yet left our backpack at the entrance, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the wait of more than 40 minutes during which rebellions and assaults of the barracks took place.
I think about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me won't even be in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me that, I think, didn't make the right start.
Of course, if they asked me to cite an example of a perfect race, this one would not come to mind.
So I think we can always dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 Olympics.
Microsoft looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At MIT’s Emerging Technologies conference, Microsoft was introduced to a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence with little intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in Microsoft’s case, a shuttle to move around the company’s campus) in response to what he was asked to do during a conversation.
Through a camera and face and shape recognition system, this “receptionist” can know how many people there are in the place, who they are – including remembering what positions they occupy – and listen to and hear the key words of their conversations.
But also group them according to conversation groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks him if she is here to visit someone and she tells him that she will answer him in a few moments.
All without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course it represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked about a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will no longer have as many programs associated with it.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were sold with the indispensable instead of unnecessary applications, they would go five times faster.
This represents a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has not stopped adding functions and "extras" to Windows.
A change of strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system is losing importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome came on the network, I was one of those who adhered to the theory that Google Chrome is Google’s first step in competing with Windows.
Several people have rightly pointed out that a web browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary since it is the indispensable basis for the computer hardware and software to understand each other.
It does the same job as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but we must see the “death” of the operating system not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system but more and more attention to the Internet browser.
We turn on the computer only to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than browsing windows.
Who uses half of the applications that come with the system?
Who can the most can the least.
And Windows 7 will have to contain fewer apps, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, cluttered months, less complex.
For now, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services to finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need this, indeed, and I show you an example.
The photo in this article was taken earlier this month in one of the Microsoft employee-only rest rooms in Redmond.
On the beverage dispenser, a poster asks them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, a study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be released in early 2009 but towards the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time.
The phone, after all, increasingly looks like a computer.
But the launch of Android being late and the iPhone already on the market, it will cost them dearly.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Cote d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's 'Diamond of Blood', as did Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' and is part of the holding of the Muscled Gay Association.
And if we start to list all his appearances, we could also mention this sturdy mustache that was lifting weights in a traveling circus.
It's not just a simple cotton men's body jersey, soft and sleeveless.
The English call it 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel of Brussels stands out among all the others.
First, by its flamboyant name - although it is known as 'Marcel' - which has to do with sport since it takes the name, according to legend, of boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
The 'Marcel' is distinguished from the others by its excellent cotton, by its unisex cut, by its distinctive logo and by the small Belgian flag (which is barely recognizable) that the best-known body jerseys have in their necks.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand does not only produce tank tops.
But it also produces sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babies, mini-shorts...
Clothes designed for the comfort of underwear.
Even if it is a shame to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
“I want to be a young mom; the candidate doesn’t worry me.”
Her enormous resemblance to her sister did not stop her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently the Cruz sisters take very seriously their new activity in fashion.
According to Monica, they are not just beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
She was present at the promotion that the Mango brand made in Paris to its new headquarters but also at the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish company sponsors.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I created for Mango for the new autumn-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards ' and the dinner of the Opera in honor of Valentino.
A very intense but, at the same time, exciting day awaits us.
What is the basis of your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The cinema of the 50s and 60s delights us and we are very inspired by it for our collections.
I love walking around the city and watching women to see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I do it often.
A dancer, an actress and a cartoonist, you are a very versatile woman, aren’t you?
I think so, but ultimately everything comes together and these activities have a lot in common.
Ever since I was little, I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to look into my aunt’s closets and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of my way of dressing.
Dancers love to dress well for classes and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And as an actress, when you put on your clothes, that's when you really put yourself in the character's shoes.
So it's all connected.
You had it not long ago 30 years ago: was it hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30s make me happy.
I find that the woman is more mature, has more experience and enjoys life with less problems.
The biological clock doesn’t scare me.
I’ve done all the things I’ve wanted to do since I was a child and that has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you think you're gonna be a mom?
Of course, I want to become a mom because my body asks me to and, moreover, I want to become a young mom; I don’t want to lose that.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
Let’s go to the movies, you wait for the different movies you shot last year to come out.
That's right, I can't wait for them to get out.
I am a woman from the theatre, I am very impatient and worried, I would like to have everything now but of course it is not possible.
I’m looking forward to the films ‘Last Hour’ and ‘In Search of the Tomb of Christ’.
Let's see what you think...
A few days ago you started on the catwalk with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I didn't get on the catwalk to model.
Simply put, Naomi Campbell called me, I’ve known her for quite some time, to invite me to attend a charity parade in London for her women’s support association and the clothes we exhibited – I exhibited two clothes from our collection created for Mango – were being auctioned off to collect money for Naomi’s NGO.
The people that Naomi is a person with a tender heart.
They say so much about her, I know her, so much is not true.
Besides, I’m fascinated by Naomi’s good side.
She asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to do the pear tree, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the third world.
Recidivists of alcohol at the wheel will have to install the 'alcolock' system
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver who has had more than three administrative penalties for alcoholemia to have a system installed in his vehicle that prevents the vehicle from starting in a drunken state, or if he does not blow.
The initiative was already announced last June and now appears in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered a pilot project that will last a year.
Its purpose is to reintegrate the driver by offering him/her road rehabilitation courses.
The Minister of State responsible for road safety, as well as the Directorate General for Road Safety and the Fondation Institut Technologique pour la Sécurité de l'Automobile will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of drivers arrested for driving more than once in a state of drunkenness, take over the car.
The alcolock would avoid this since it is a system plugged into the vehicle that measures the alcohol level in the breath and prevents starting the vehicle if the driver does not blow forward; or when the driver's alcohol level is higher than allowed.
It costs more than 1,000 euros and is the responsibility of the driver.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced up to 65% of violations during the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people every year.
This is due only to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And facilitate its implementation, since the legal reform can be done by ordinary means but, nevertheless, the reform done by criminal means requires a reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have an experimental one.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party that proposes to install this system in school buses as it has been done in France.
Mexico without peep-toes
At 5.40 p.m., the official scheduled time, the Spanish Air Force plane in which the Princes of Asturias were traveling landed in the presidential hangar of Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was on the eve of sunset but its rays still forced to put their hand as a visor to be able to see the royal couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier I had asked the taxi driver in the street if he knew that the Spanish princes were visiting the city to finish their official trip.
- Ah, all right, so we can't go to the airport to pick up customers at this time... are you from here or so...?
- No, no, sir, I'm Spanish but I lived here thinking two years.
- Oh, all right.
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and knows the importance of travel.
There are several waiting in the airport hangar near the red carpet and a military row consisting of 27 navy soldiers.
The prince is smiling and dressed in navy blue, the princess, when to her, has hair in the wind, is dressed very sober and does not wear her usual 'peep-toes'; perhaps they had told her that a storm was threatening.
They make a brief stop with the photographers before going to the room where the official procession awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a funny Mexican television reporter awaits them.
The most prestigious award in fashion
There is surely no more suitable place in the world to present a fashion prize than Paris and there is surely no living cartoonist more extraordinary and good living than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, in order to strengthen the international image of new fashion talents.
The winner will be rewarded with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian who won the first edition, looked at her models in the window of Mango at 54 boulevard Haussmann in Paris and she almost cried with emotion.
Certainly this is the second largest store of the brand in Europe that has just been inaugurated with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first shop is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the stylist Valentino, president of the jury of the competition, made that we ended up in a luxurious dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With that of the extraordinary Chagals family as the next table, the presidential table prepared by Mango seemed even more spectacular.
Having grown up on the heart and making against bad fortune good heart, because of the recent death of her brother, Nati put on a garment of Mango and some adornments of ELAH, which cut the breath, and arms on it, arms down with her son Luis - a handsome man almost two meters tall - she accompanied Valentino to his dinner prepared in his honor.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, as well as the Baron de Rotchil finished the evening without a coat because they had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who showed up at the store with trousers and a shirt – from her own collection – and who for dinner transformed into a sexy and black long dress, was moved when during the night tour of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the rehearsal room of the ballets and remembering the good old days, she took a great gesture.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the visit of the outbuildings of the palace, but she showed us before on her cell phone photos of her son.
The next morning we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez – another handsome man who rides a motorcycle – and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, towels and having asked beforehand, that there be no odors in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget about the chaos and frenzy of everyday life.
And to top it all off, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to bookstores on September 30th.
The wake-up call almost saddens us when it rings every morning at 7 o’clock, but it’s even worse when we think about the hectic pace that current life imposes on us.
The office is synonymous with tension and the computer with back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is neither one nor two methods to combat daily fatigue and problems related to the world of work.
But 1001, not one more or one less.
Apart from yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of methods adapted to the taste and time of each.
The anti-stress work is titled '1001 Ways to Relax' and will arrive at bookstores directly from publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to obtain tranquility in places like work or through personal relationships, this ‘manual’ denies such a belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that help you relax.
If adrenaline doesn’t run through your veins to restore your body’s balance and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, disconnect from your mind, and focus on reading.
Talking to Sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very awake telling us something that happened the day before, but to children who talk while they sleep.
The first time this happens it may surprise you, but in reality it doesn’t matter.
This is a mild sleep disorder called somniloquie.
This is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
Of course, there are more than one person who speaks at night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (once in life for example associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child remembers nothing.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often linked to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, nocturnal bedwetting, or sleepwalking, but this is not always the case.
As we have said before, they can also be associated with very high fevers, stress or overexcitement.
Either way, this is a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
He may speak in a quiet little voice, with isolated words, whispers or, on the contrary, with screams, tears, long speeches...
In the event that sleepiness becomes very common, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and in order to get an explanation for this problem.
We said this is a benign alteration, which is why there is no treatment, unless it is related to another sleep alteration that can be treated (for example, if it is related to sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
So look for quiet games and avoid programs or TV shows that are more or less violent.
With children who are very nervous and have trouble relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm down internally.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as the sleeping pills appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him up.
It's useless because he's unconscious and you'd wake him up.
Even if he speaks, he sleeps and rests.
Remember that if he is very anxious several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he is saying (which is not usual), don’t be tempted to question him for information.
You will get nothing, because in sleeping, he is not conscious to be able to organize his thought.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what he is dreaming about, so pay attention to how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Never tell the child that you can question him during the night to know his secrets.
Not even jokingly.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, do not worry, this is nothing bad, it is an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... at last.
Illhaeusern finally found his way to victory on his field after a long period of starvation.
Without making a big game, the Yellows and Blacks created the most opportunities and managed to turn one for the win of the game.
The pace was not very strong during this meeting where the attackers had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by the visiting captain Kauffmann, who was near the skylight from a distance, Illhaeusern would take the ascendant slightly and in turn Fonderflick from a distance, and then with Hirn on top, Romain from the tip of the foot or Diebold would come to tickle the defense of Dannemarie.
In front, we were block in the middle of the field and we just left the Riahi stirring at the tip of the attack.
The start of the second half was going to be decisive with first two chances signed Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illuusiens by Marais, well positioned to pick up a ball pushed back on a first attempt by Diebold (53rd').
But the Illousiens scorer will not be able to enjoy his happiness for long and will be forced to return to the locker rooms a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not know how to take advantage of it and will not pose any big problems to an Illustusian Eleven who just backed down a little to "compact" his defense, except in the last seconds of the game where, after a big blur, the ball passed very close to the transverse.
Sarkozy meets Angry Fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour through Brittany.
Faced with the demonstration of strength of the fishermen who severely disturbed the accesses to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, to meet their representatives.
They have promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he "will come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that falls at the same time as a general assembly of the "crisis committee" created by the Breton fishermen to get measures in the face of the surge in gas oil prices, which reached a record of more than 1.14 euros per liter on average.
According to the spokesman of the Elysée David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies regain competitiveness and to secure the conditions of employment and remuneration of sailors".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to stand firm by the fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted snail operations in Morbihan and Calvados, causing closures of nearly 10 km.
The marina of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not stop.
A filtering dam has been put in place on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors have already shown their determination Monday by burning, from dawn, tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic and Channel fronts, such as Les Sables d'Olonne, in the Vendée, where trawlers remained at the dock, or in Le Havre, where some twenty boats blocked the movements of commercial vessels.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique, stopped in the evening the blockade of the important Total refinery of Donges.
Those of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for Wednesday's meeting at the ministry to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide Tuesday on the follow-up to the movement and its participation in the interview scheduled for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, which has not supported their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not let go of anything" and "do not want to move to Paris", for example announced Liliane Cariou, the president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per liter but they believe that the threshold of profitability of a boat is reached only with a diesel of less than 0.30 euros per liter.

Embraer maintains its delivery forecast in 2008
The Brazilian planemaker expects 215 planes to be delivered this year despite the threat of recession that looms over the global economy.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, maintains its 2008 deliveries forecast with 215 aircraft delivered, said Fredrico Fleury Curado, its president.
In the first half, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its 30- to 120-seat aircraft.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG plans to sell more than 15% of its assets
American International Group, which the U.S. monetary authorities have bailed out, plans to divest more than 15 percent of its assets to repay the $85 billion it received, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its business beyond its international life insurance and its retirement business in the United States, according to sources familiar with the matter.
AIG's board of directors met on Sunday evening to consider possible divestments, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets AIG plans to separate include its international air leasing subsidiary Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings and its real estate portfolio and private equity investments.
No final decision has been taken on these divestitures, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly liquidate to repay the Federal Reserve’s $85 billion loan at the risk of the US authorities taking 80% of its capital, diluting current shareholders to the extent necessary.
Analysis Paris Session History Morning Meeting History Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange experienced a historic drop Monday after the House rejected the Paulson bank bailout: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) plunged 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the largest drop in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The technology-dominant Nasdaq index fell 199.61 points to 1,983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 8.81% (or 106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the bank bailout plan that was supposed to restore some stability in the markets.
By 228 votes against and 205 votes in favour, representatives denied Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Nearly two in three Republicans rejected his plan.
“It’s a bad signal to the market that Congress is unable to adopt a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
“It shows how much the market relied on this plan,” she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would come “too late.”
“If the project is actually moribund...then the relay will be quickly passed to the Fed and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions,” Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight, said in a statement.
“Every day that passes brings the downfall of a financial institution in the United States,” said Piegza.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities arranged for his rival Citigroup to buy Wachovia’s banking activities.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, prompting emergency interventions for banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, signaling that markets are facing “not just a US crisis, but a global crisis,” the FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 3.632 percent, down from 3.827 percent on Friday night, and the 30-year-old to 4.161 percent, down from 4.357 percent the day before.
Obama Wins First TV Duel Points
In Friday’s first debate between the two candidates for the White House followed another to find out who, from John McCain or Barack Obama, won.
Unsurprisingly, Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this television duel that was reportedly watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen said McCain's performance, while honorable, was not "bright enough" to allow him to stem his decline in the five-week presidential polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll published on Saturday gave Obama a five-point lead (49% vs. 44% for McCain), said the Democrat had pulled his pin from the game.
Among the undecided voters, who are the ones who count, Obama came out victorious for 39% of those polled, while 25% of them awarded McCain the victory, according to a CBS poll.
Obama is expected to be able to confirm his lead Thursday with the good performance expected from his colist, Joseph Biden, in the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
“It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
She has good instincts," Clinton said.
Seventy-year-old McCain has consistently highlighted his indisputable foreign policy experience, while emphasizing his adversary’s “naivety” on those issues that were at the heart of this first-of-its-kind.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he has repeatedly accused.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president,” he said.
An angle of attack hammered since yesterday in Republican television advertisements.
Obama said he was the future.
Without dismantling himself, he was concise and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
“McCain still hasn’t understood, while Obama has,” he retorted, this weekend, a Democratic spot blaming the Republican for not taking full measure of the impact of the crisis on the “street American.”
“During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama said in an interview with 20,000 people gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina in the throbbing rain.
He didn’t even say the words “middle class” or “workers.” The financial rout clearly benefits Obama, who is seen by Americans as the most capable of saving the economy on the brink of precipice.
“The coming week could be a turning point,” said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration official, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current debacle “is the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.”
Reaffirming that he would still be able to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite Wall Street upheavals, the Illinois senator also pointed out that the achievement of a possible energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energies was his first priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain, meanwhile, wanted to build a park of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Cautious, the two candidates shied away from questions about the $700 billion ($470 billion) bailout plan adopted last night by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "did you notice that there was an election?"
Young people and opponents were demonstrating on Sunday night in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the legislative elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered Sunday evening as soon as the polling stations in the central square of Minsk closed to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislatures.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resign".
Some admit they didn’t even vote: “What good, since they’ll do what they want with my voice,” one young man says.
They do not believe that the regime that has made good use of foreign observers with the aim of resuming its language with the European Union is ready to make a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including a visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if the elections were considered clean by observers.
They were not according to the opposition.
"We have been kept away from electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the counting," said Yuri Potemkine, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
“It’s a cosmetic change,” said Alexandre Milinkievitch, a former opposition presidential candidate from 2006 and leader of the pro-European movement, “because the important thing is who counts the voices, and with us, it’s the executive branch.
If members of the opposition enter parliament, they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions, and bills.”
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis, and we don’t reform ourselves, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will not recognize the validity of the ballot.
She stresses that the turnout figures seem too high, and that the generalization of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the door to all manipulations.
“Have you noticed that there was an election, you?” asked Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, those who are best suited to power.”
The silence of the night falls back on the square of October.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission welcome their success.
The Interview - Blood is Safe Again
Héma-Québec was celebrating the 10th anniversary of its founding yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, as Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And most importantly, it regained the public trust that had been seriously shaken by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood supply managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service was contaminated with acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
Faced with this tragedy and public grudge, the Government of Canada instituted in February 1994 a public inquiry, presided over by Judge Horace Krever, to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations that such a disaster should not happen again.
While Judge Krever was delaying in filing his report, some provinces set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee fulfilled this mandate.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Services to supply all other provinces and two territories.
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its activities, only 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec," recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
Through efforts to improve the safety of blood and work products in the field during the years that followed, we regained public confidence," she said, adding that in early 2008, nearly 94% of the Quebec population now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary, however, keeps in mind that “trust is something extremely fragile.”
From its inception, on September 28, 1998, Héma-Québec applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, there were many cases in Europe of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, tells the story of the one that has held the fort since its foundation in 1998.
"And we didn't know at all if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
We then relied on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gelineau reports, according to which when it is not known and that a serious disease may result, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain inevitably leading to death, exclusion measures are introduced.
In April 1999, the blood of people who had been in the UK for more than a month since 1980 was refused.
A few years ago, it was clear that the disease was spread through the blood.
This episode showed us that the precautionary principle we applied made sense."
In 1999, a much more sensitive HIV testing technique appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests (NTAs) that directly detect the presence of the virus itself in the blood of donors and not that of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used until then were based.
TANs have shortened the silent period, which stretches from when the person was infected to when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
This period could be reduced to less than a week.
This has substantially reduced the risk that some donors are unknowingly infected and cannot be detected.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
“In other words, it means you’ll have to distribute 12 million blood products before someone is infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of transmission of HIV by a blood product occurs.
I believe we can now feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover our health," said Héma-Québec's Chief Executive Officer.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
Just last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect into the bloodstream.
We must be constantly vigilant," continues Dr. Décary, before stressing that in addition to a secure supply, Héma-Québec must also provide for an adequate supply.
“The needs are increasing because the population is getting older.
Because cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need refills in red blood cells or platelets.
The aging of the population also has consequences for the blood donor network, which on average represents only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation."
Healthy people 18 years of age and older who meet the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer their blood are not accepted because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled to a malaria-ridden country, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
“With these 3%, we are able to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Scarcity is very rare.
But the members of this donor network must be renewed as they get older and can no longer donate their blood.
It is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to hold them back and encourage them to become regular donors.
Because today’s life is so unbridled, we rarely find time to spend an hour giving of our blood,” says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec provides not only blood products, but also human tissue, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for heavy burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered a biomedical waste is full of blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“A few weeks ago, we celebrated the banking of our thousandth cord blood sample and we plan to take more than a thousand a year.
We should start proposing transplants early next year,” says Dr. Décary, who describes the cord blood sampling program as very popular.
"Several mothers are disappointed that they cannot access them," because Héma-Québec does not have the means to offer this complex and costly program in every hospital in Quebec.
Soccer - The Impact in the semi-final
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semi-final round of the USL First Division playoffs, thanks to a 3-1 win (4-3 total goals) at the expense of the Seattle Sounders yesterday in the second and decisive game of the quarterfinal series in total goals, at the Stade Saputo.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of play.
After a goalless first half on both sides, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the other nets of the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one to beat Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Recall that in the first game of the round trip series on Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 loss at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, suburban Seattle.
The impact will be measured at the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder filled a 3-1 deficit in the return game to win 4-3, but the Whitecaps still made it to the 5-4 semi-final round in total goals.
The Impact is expected to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short - Kovalev's victorious goal
The Canadian’s number one trio is ready to start the season.
The unit of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the attack in a 3-2 win from the Canadian at the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec racked up two assists, and Kovalev picked up a pass in that win, the fourth of the Tricolor in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian warned.
I need another game to feel comfortable.”
"He tried to do too much in the first half," said Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he enjoyed the end of the game.
He had a nice ovation.”
Charest on the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out triggering elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party was finished, Jean Charest visited yesterday Jean-Talon, in Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), tries to get elected on the occasion of today's by-election.
"Strengthening the limits of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented visually while remaining broadly speaking, at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, was projected a kind of Mill of images.
On three huge screens, spectacular shots of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec seen by Google Maps, maps, etc. were filmed in a loop.
Big money, just like during elections.
At the press briefing, the Prime Minister refused to rule out that he would trigger the election this fall, even though he pointed out that his schedule was very busy.
The "Plan Nord" is the fourth part of a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes an agreement on the workforce with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the speeches of the Prime Minister recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory at 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was "a jewel of immense potential", but did not give a deadline, investment amounts, or specific priority in future projects.
At most there are a few avenues for further development: hydropower, forestry, but above all the mining sector, boosted by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond," according to the enumeration of Mr. Charest.
This "territory twice as big as France", "it's home, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it home, but it is in us,” he insisted, as if to show that he was soliciting a national founding myth.
Quebec has built up a lot in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
“It’s ours, it’s our future,” he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said at the news briefing.
“This is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time and, when the opportunity arises, I reiterate that position on behalf of the government,” he said.
“With climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North,” he said, referring to the Northwest Passage, which will open year-round due to melting ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, First Nations and Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pequiste member of Ungava), have already begun consultations with about thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place, has begun work.
The prime minister does not rule out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "we will give ourselves a common vision".
The development of the North would be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "concert, orderly and environmentally friendly," he said.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in continuity with that of the Liberal prime minister who preceded it.
“Like the Liberals before us, we have thought differently to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a big cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s arrival at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Power Station to Adélard-Godbout Dam.
“From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who made the Quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, who made James Bay, our party has forged the future,” Charest said.
As a point of press, he invoked another conservative reference, John Diefenbaker's "Roads to the North" program, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr. Charest stressed that its commissioning was planned for 2012.
“It stays between us there, but I plan to be there,” he told his activists, eliciting cheerful applause at home.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of triggering a vote this fall, which the law allows him.
He points out that his schedule is filled, however, notably by a mission of the Federation Council in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend’s General Council provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including “constitutional aspirations” that are passed as a letter to the post: the PLQ calls in particular for recognition of the “specificity of Quebec” in the Constitution.
He also hoped that Quebec would appoint members of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission and that they would have a veto over the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the opposition side, the broad outlines of the Northern Plan were met with skepticism.
The chief fisherman, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Nord-du-Québec Development Policy that the Landry government launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, gave up on applying it.
If he had done so, "we would have been more advanced today" commented Ms. Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (voting that takes place today), Françoise Mercure.
ADQ said it supports the government's adoption of a Northern Plan.
“But what we want is that it’s not just a show,” said leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who is returning from vacation today.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (or irony) in the Harper cabinet, who last summer allowed himself to say of Louise Arbour that she was a "shame" for Canada.
To cast reproach on this woman who has waged a relentless struggle for justice and who deserves our admiration says as much about the Prime Minister's entourage as about Stephen Harper himself.
We are facing a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its national locked up in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager at the time of the facts that are being blamed on him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, denies its word and allows a child soldier to be killed in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
Recall, for example, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association are advocating for the repatriation of Omar Khadr for a fair trial in Canada.
It is this same government that turns a blind eye to torture: it doesn’t matter if a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably forever after so many years of exactions.
We are not yet aware of it, but we are witnessing at this moment an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", the word that Harper keeps brandishing and that sounds so hollow in his mouth.
The time has come when there is no morality anymore: one can mishandle, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the goodwill of a head of government so far a minority (what will be after October 14...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that advocates the Virtue, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what made our country's reputation and dignity.
Shame, Mr. Toews, is there, in this resignation, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, Executive Vice President of Canadian Mining Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, he claims that the world’s largest gold company has filed a six-million-dollar defamation lawsuit against three authors and a small, penniless publishing house with the aim of launching a “transparent public debate.”
While it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of defamation proceedings, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely obscured by Mr. Garver.
Because, for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to bring to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and publisher of the book Black Canada will have to spend considerable sums in preparation for their defense and to fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of the mine.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose an amicable settlement that will gag the opposition in addition to frightening anyone who dares to look back at the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was in front of the public that she should have presented her view of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are normally conducted through the exchange of ideas and not with batons.
It was enough for the miner to open his books, his files and establish a real debate, through the newspapers, the media, the publications and the funding of independent research teams that could have made light of the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to trust public opinion and rejects petitions and letters of support to the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he can both demand a "public" debate while contempt for the views of that same audience?
In the world of the Vice-President, it seems that this word refers only to lawyers who are overpaid and not all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democracy, even critics have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn't understand, or doesn't want to understand, is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does so primarily because it rejects the brutal way of mining.
This audience is ready to hear Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not as part of what many perceive as a gag suit (following the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just filed a formal notice to the authors of Noir Canada urging them to cease using the term...).
Beyond Mr. Garver’s surreal discourse, Barrick Gold’s prosecution is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the quest for truth, essential to any democratic society.
It denies, as a whole, the right to quote from credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which represent the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss issues that are displeasing to the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right of reply.
The academic community, to which we belong, has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s disproportionate prosecution makes it clear that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for academia, as it is for public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place mechanisms to limit such abusive prosecutions.
Wall Street Rescue - Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republican and Democratic, finally came to an agreement yesterday on the biggest economic bailout since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has shaken Wall Street for months is yet to be endorsed by both houses of Congress.
It includes: better monitoring by elected officials of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for failure to pay, as well as a right to look at the salaries paid to the managers of the companies rescued.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news minutes after midnight yesterday, after a two-day negotiation marathon.
“We have made great progress toward an agreement that will be effective in the markets,” said Bush administration Representative Henry Paulson.
“Everything has been done in a way that protects the real economy and ordinary Americans from the ongoing crisis on Wall Street,” she said.
“That’s the fundamental point: if we don’t do that, the trauma, chaos and disruption to Americans’ daily lives will be immense,” said Rep. Judd Gregg.
Negotiations had turned to sprint in recent hours for fear of the effect a new failure would have on investors’ moods.
The time limit we agreed to was the opening of the markets this morning.
Lately associated with the negotiations, the two candidates in the U.S. presidential election have been rather supportive of the agreement, while expressing their dissatisfaction that we are forced to reach this extreme.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has claimed to have added some provisions to the agreement, including allowing homeowners to keep their homes and allowing them to keep their salaries on the salaries of the executives of the companies that have been rescued by the state.
“When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary action because of the irresponsibility of some, there is nothing to be congratulated on.
But these measures are necessary," he said on U.S. television.
Asked on another channel whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
“The outlines I’ve read [show] that it’s something that we’re all going to have to digest and that we’re going to be able to move forward with.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to buy back with taxpayers’ money the dubious, risky and unsold debts of U.S. financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the bursting of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of risky mortgages (subprimes) before expanding to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and leading to a freeze of liquidity and the banishment of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republicans who overturned the first draft agreement last week.
It is believed to have come out of this deadlock since Democrats accepted that some “toxic” assets of struggling companies are only insured by the government, rather than bought.
In order to round the corners for everyone in Congress, a provision was also added stating that if the government were to assume losses for five years with this program, it could put in place new taxes to help it recover its stake.
The new plan provides for a first tranche of $250 billion, plus $100 billion if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of another $350 billion is expected to be endorsed by another Congressional vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get stakes in rescued companies that will earn him dividends in the event of a profit and that he can resell when the turmoil is over.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay the seizure procedures for housing related to the real estate loans covered by this plan, as well as to set limits on the pay and severance pay paid to the managers of the affected companies.
The plan's architects would like to see it put to the House vote today, and the Senate vote Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green light.
Yesterday, votes continued to rise against this bill, both in the Republican and Democratic camps.
“Obviously, Washington doesn’t hear you,” Republican House Finance Committee member Scott Garrett told voters.
“Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not for the benefit of taxpayers.”
Host of a small group in Congress dubbed “the caucus of skeptics,” Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred eminent professors of economics, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to tell us: we are asking Congress not to rush and to carefully consider the way forward,” he said.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again proof of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was giving up on acquiring its competitor in full shipwreck since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US) in the crisis of risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the top 20 European banks and top 10 insurers.
"This is not lost money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said.
In exchange, a right to vote in the bank and influence is recovered.
This is precisely something that savers and households appreciate now that times are proving uncertain.”
Meanwhile, on the other side of the English Channel, the British government seemed on track to nationalize another bank battered by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all the loans in progress at Bradford and Bringley, including more than 41 billion ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
Spanish bank Santander said yesterday it would buy the UK bank’s branches and customer accounts.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an Engaged Icon
Her azure-eyed beauty has long been her asset card, some will say her weakness.
Did he get rid of the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His modesty, sensitivity and a talent that flowed from the source will also have him removed from the power register that gives birth to the true sacred monsters.
What a great runner!
Paul Newman, who disappeared Friday, aged 83, from lung cancer on his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last American film icons of the splendor years.
Less monumental than Brando, whom he resembled and of whom he was for a long time a sort of on-screen rival, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the bursting of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, the ultimate brand of quality.
In him, a whole country fell in love with the self-made man, the Pacific War fighter, wounded in combat, who in the early 1950s studied drama at Yale and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in the theater, on television, soon in the cinema.
The same man who campaigned for civil rights was also the car driver who finished second at the Le Mans 24 Hours in 1979, along with a sex symbol, although he was a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
Also disappearing with him are the shadowy areas of this secret, discreet, committed star, allergic to the breaks of show business, whose enigma will not have been fully penetrated.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
The disappearance of Paul Newman has brought dizziness to moviegoers this weekend, as his big roles clash on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of perpetually mutating American art parades through it.
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid's charming cowboy (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on a heated roof adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we evoke his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
This delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano in Robert Wise's Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role destined for James Dean, reprised after his death, which really launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic villain in the brilliant The Sting, Oscar for Best Picture in 1973.
A bittersweet billiards player and avenger in Robert Rossen’s magnificent The Hustler (1961), he will reprise the character on his return in Martin Scorsese’s The Color of Money, which earned him his only Oscar out of nine nominations in 1987.
That face through the ages was him.
It's him again.
The epochs are tumbling through his path.
Young people know him mostly through George Roy Hill's cult Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen Brothers.
With a final Irish Mafia sponsor role in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the loop was closed.
Contrary to several film legends who quit early on, Newman remained in the saddle for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, its golds, its splendor and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, not without humor, "as a living challenge to "underplaying" considering his performances too supported.
The profession was not always tender for the handsome Paul Newman to whom the roles fell for a long time cooked in the beak.
However, he played less often the first young than the marginalized: neurotic, alcoholic, bastard or desperate, whose perfect traits reflected drifts and revolts.
As a director, Newman revealed little-known facets of his true modest sensibility.
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (according to the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, traced a fine female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott to overdose dedicated to him his 1984 film Harry and Son, a work of modesty and sadness.
Among the shower of tributes that poured yesterday on Newman, his great friend and former fellow-at-arms Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very saddened: "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrant traits of the disappeared actor.
Beyond his legendary career, he also erases a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester of Hollywood drifts.
We will have seen much of his well-being throned on jars of dressing, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging the process to be quite bad taste, although gag at first.
However, the proceeds from these sales were paid to his Foundation for Children in Difficulty.
Newman, rather than sit on his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be here.”
And a privilege for us to have followed the path of such a lucid and generous American artist.
A model citizen, in sum and in addition.
What could Zuschlag Company do in their invoice factory?
Soon, on 8 October, the hearings related to the current criminal procedure will begin, against János Zuschlag and his accomplices.
The politician and his accomplices are charged with fraud, in the form of a criminal organization, on a permanent and regular basis, resulting in particularly significant damages, and other charges have been brought against them, such as forgery and the use of forgeries.
According to the prosecutor's office, the money from grants was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The money from the state and municipalities, about 65 million HUF in total, went to the coffers of the Fiatal Baloldal movement on the one hand and to the pockets of some people on the other.
Their method, also made public by the investigating authorities, was to receive money from the grants obtained by issuing invoices for expenses, behind which no actual services were provided and thus, the associations never fulfilled their commitments.
According to the indictment, much of the invoices were forged.
For the latter, they procured invoice books at the Józsefváros market, while they manufactured the stamps in Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that would appear on the invoices, it was decided, among other things, during the tours in the northern province of Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag.
According to the testimony of the latter, he had to locate pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he requested an invoice, on the model of which they made the other invoices that they were going to introduce, among others, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Municipality of the Capital to access subsidies.
The majority of the invoices were created by István Lados and his accomplice András ?ri, who according to our information, was mainly concerned with drafting the files necessary to obtain the grants.
During a "tracking circuit", one of Lados's choices was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place has been responsible for the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy this place at the same time.
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the invoice drawn up in the name of the Jobb Jövért Foundation, which would later bear the name Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért, was full of errors of form and substance.
A guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj actually had only three rooms, and a maximum of ten people could stay overnight, yet the bill mentioned one hundred and thirty guests.
The issuers of invoices with the overflowing imagination also fell into excess, when they mentioned the company Pigal Kft, also belonging to the Horeca sector. In their accounts, neither the name of Jobb Jövért nor that of the Hoppa appeared, according to the information given to the prosecutor's office.
The company's manager, Gyoz Farkas, told hvg.hu that when the prosecutor's office summoned him and showed him the invoices, he immediately knew it was fake documents.
“Our company name and tax number were placed in the wrong place on the stamp.”
He added: "Beyond the form, the fact that according to the invoice, a hundred people stayed there, was also not suitable, since this establishment has only eleven rooms, which do not have as much space.
In addition, the invoice also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
The issuers of zealous invoices also did not inquire about the Budapest travel agencies, which were part of their choice, but only organized trips abroad. Thus, naively, they indicated stays in Hungary on invoices to be paid in cash, which also goes against the accounting practices of the agency.
Moreover, as the survey showed, they also added VAT on these documents, while services relating to travel activities, whose destination is outside the European Union, are invoiced without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices drawn up in the name of the Hotel Revfülöp at the order of Jobb Jövért was incorrect, since the company's services do not support a VAT of 25% as indicated, but a VAT of 15%. In addition, the hotel employees issue only printed invoices, while the fakes were handwritten.
The prosecutor's investigation reveals that the "issuers" also made mistakes in referring as a service to the transport of goods by road, which the invoice issuing company could not exercise, since its profile was investment advice.
In addition, it is also due to defects of form, such as inadequate types of invoices and false stamps, that the invoices issued to the order of Együtt to Harmadik Evezredert Alapítvány, of XXI.
As in the case of the company Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó sports workshop, both of which deny that they are the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
Nor did the forgers pay attention to the fact that the company HIB Kft., based in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to have a meal at their house.
Deliberately established invoices
Another category of invoice issuers is those who were fully aware that they were being asked to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták grouping, has drawn up an invoice to the Együtt Foundation to Harmadik Évezredért, for an amount of four million HUF.
According to the indictment, the manager of the company Collab Kft. was led to issue false invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
Likewise, it cooperated with the Zuschlags, the company Biogate Kft., which is currently in liquidation and which in 2003 issued invoices to the Jobb Jövért Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület Association and the Vorösfeny-Egyesület Association, for an amount of about five million HU.
No financial movement took place, either, as the invoices issued were later cancelled, but the agencies avoided mentioning it in their accounts.
The next category of invoice issuing companies is those directly related to the accused.
For example, the administrative representative of the managing director of Delta Trió Kft., dealing with the trade in fuel and motor vehicles, whose head office was in Budapest, but where it was not found, was Iván Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, this company issued several invoices for the sale of IT equipment, amounting to approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, the equipment was purchased by the company Cash Investment Kft. de Kiskunhalas, which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of the company was a man of Romanian origin, to whom Ivan Kubatov also allegedly sent documents related to the company, between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices to Atlasz, Hoppa and Együtt companies to Harmadik Évezredért Alapitvány, and that he pocketed their countervalue.
It was precisely at the request of Ivan Kubatov that Romanian Masons created the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In reality, none of these companies worked, which the accused explained by the fact that they were not receiving work.
He still used these companies, since at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, co-accused and editor of the founding documents of the companies, he established invoices to their names, to the order of associations related to Zuschlag, such as the associations Atlasz and Y-Generació.
Kubatov donated 15 invoices in total to organizations issued by Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, worth HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecutor’s office thought that 10% of the sums shown on the invoices and VAT were in Kubatov’s pocket.
The man even used the company Szi-Beri Bt. to establish fictitious invoices that were used as part of Biztos Pont’s grant application.
In January 2006, the Association Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted a grant application to the Socialist Party's public utility, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They received this grant for an amount of twice 500,000 HUF, but these amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the application.
To prevent this from becoming known, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. were presented at the TMA.
Moreover, it is these invoices that were found during the search carried out in the office of Árpád Kemecsei, in the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the defendants will report on the method of making the invoices, as they had previously done before the prosecution.
What could be really interesting would be that the main defendant, János Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the veil over the whole story.
So far, his confessions are not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to tell the smallest details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or perhaps the Socialists would have reached an agreement according to which, in exchange for the reimbursement of a large part of the 50 million HUF, Zusi would wear the hat alone.
Today, the latter is probably vexed, as applications for his supervised residency, based on a relief of his conditions of detention, continually fall into the ears of a deaf person.
While those who have caused much greater damage, and the perpetrators of non-reparable economic crimes, walk around freely or at least wait at their own home for the end of the procedure.
The Psychology of Overbidding: Why Do We Spend More Money?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the merchandise.
New York University neurology and economics researchers have managed to update the neurological and economic bases of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, human beings do not want to be distanced during this type of competition, such as an auction on eBay, and that is why they even prefer to pay a high price.
This research has attempted to draw a neurological pattern of this kind of "game" using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lottery, while the other group took part in a playful auction, while using a functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) process, the researchers analyzed the active brain domains of the experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could earn money, but during the auction, an essential element of which is a third-party overselling, the whole under the brainstem, called the striatum, was moving intensely when the game was lost.
This part of the brain, along with several other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "self-stimulation" of the nervous system.
That is why, according to the researchers, the rise in prices can be explained by the flight in the face of the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theories, the economists of this group of researchers continued financial surveillance analyses.
At the time, three groups were bidding against a partner in various circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question, and thus made their bet.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they would come out winning the game, then they would receive an additional $15 as a reward.
While the third group received this $15 before the auctions, the group members also lost that money, in case they lost the auctions.
The difference between these two groups is in fact that the focus was in one group on victory, while in the other, on failure.
Proving the neurologists' hypothesis, members of the players' team "against failure" were willing to bet higher than those made by the control group and the group "for victory".
“These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
Indeed, each of them explained the phenomena observed during auctions only by the pleasure of winning and the parade before the risk.
Only methods of neurological imaging have helped to remove the contradiction between the two theories by now leading to a third explanation." - noted Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics at New York University.
Hepatitis: When should we see a doctor?
Worldwide, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
There are an estimated one hundred thousand patients carrying the hepatitis virus in Hungary, but only seven miles are being treated, which is because patients often do not know that they are carriers of the virus.
Hepatitis is a generic name given to infections that affect the liver and are caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and jaundice are characteristic, but the pathogens and diseases generated differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, depending on the pathogenic genes, spread mainly in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g. contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
For travelers, it is recommended that they get vaccinated against viruses A and B. There is no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating contaminated foods, usually accompanied by poor general condition, weakness, stomach aches and nausea.
Then develops on the skin and on the white of the eye a visible jaundice, the stools become lighter and the urine takes a darker color. Healing can take two to three weeks.
Every year around the world, one million people die of the most serious form of this pathology, such as cancer or liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten patients receive medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients are not known to have the virus, because the pathogenic gene deceptively destroys liver cells. In many cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests.
Contamination is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: people who underwent blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
Currently, there are 200 million patients with chronic type C hepatitis worldwide.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult your treating doctor as soon as you observe symptoms of unknown origin.
The disease can be cured, if it is detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, in this way the risk of infection disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized in 2004 by organizations representing patients from all over the world.
Its goal is to draw attention to chronic cirrhosis of the liver, caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does one who believes in God feel less pain?
According to the results of a recent research, religious belief would function as a kind of analgesic, which would already have contributed to making the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The British daily Telegraph published an article that researchers at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment by analyzing at what level belief in God could influence human pain tolerance.
In the context of this at least bizarre experiment, 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists were subjected to electroshocks, while each of them was observing a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to rule out much of the suffering.
Through a technique of palpation of the human brain, it has also been discovered that Catholics have been able to activate the part of their brain responsible for regulating pain.
This analysis is the first in a series of experiments, in which academics, scholars, philosophers and theologians participate from different sectors of the university.
More precisely, the experiment takes place in the following way: an instrument emitting sparks and diffusing electroshocks is fixed on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to look closely at two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Hermine Lady painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers behind this experiment hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary evokes a kind of state of faith among believers, while the choice of Da Vinci's painting, not very different from the first, focused on its soothing effect.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and meanwhile, received 20 electroshocks in four parts in succession, while looking either at religious-themed or more general-themed painting.
Catholics said that at the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt like they were “safe,” like someone “taken care of,” and they “calmed down, and peace invaded them.”
At the sight of the religious-themed painting, they reported 12% less pain than when they were looking at Leonardo's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experiment, believes that the same effects can be achieved with any other strong image, in atheists, provided that the appropriate photo is found.
“We should find a picture they react to very positively, like a mother or father,” he said.
Tom Wright, Anglican bishop, welcomed the results of this research.
“The practice of faith should change, and in many cases, it actually changes our personality,” Wright added.
After these excellent results, there remains only the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of the subjects if the believers were shown a Madonna painted by Leonardo or by a painter of the same caliber?
Would the sight of a better Virgin Mary produce better results?
You are what you reveal about yourself.
On the occasion of his tenth birthday, Google says that he can be found at the bottom of people’s pockets just like the sky above their heads. He knows where they spent their holidays, which specialists they consult and what their interests are.
But that’s not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the most influential people in society.
While skeptics draw parallels to Orwell’s horror vision, they just don’t see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main ambition is to gather even more information about its users. This is necessary so that Google’s founders can meet their initial goal that sounded like: “Let’s collect all the information in a system in the world!”.
According to the Google executive interviewed, after ten years of work of global upheaval, they are still only at the beginning of their goals to be able to process all the information.
Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer questions like "What could I do tomorrow?" or "What job would I do best?" However, software will only be able to answer this kind of question, simple at first glance, when they know enough about users.
It is not entirely clear to all internet users that the words used during internet searches, the IP address of the computer that launches the search and the pages visited by the interested parties are precisely listed.
Through the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own search history and can view what they searched for, what they clicked on. Thanks to this, in the long term, Recommendations, program based on the same logic, will be able to give much more personalized answers, and we will submit products and services based on our previous statements and preferences.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if they look at what my job is? ask users, who worry seeing Google's information monopoly.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can arouse fear, and it is not remorse, the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or possibly the revolt against power that can arouse a counter-reaction among Internet users.
It is a confirmed fact, however, that the search terms are not only registered, but in justified cases, they are passed on to a third party, and in this kind of legal case, nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most striking example of recent times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google transmitted to the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, thus allowing identification.
Human rights-conscious Internet users were able to breathe a sigh of relief last May, when Google, arm in arm with the electronic legal protection agency EFF, proved its right in court to the FBI. According to the ruling, in the future, Google will still not be able to be forced by any of the points in the constitution to disclose information on the FBI’s secret application of any kind.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms it had won over the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, passed several years earlier. But ultimately, it failed to procure the lists of private users' searches, or the entire list of websites and keywords from the past two months.)
Google’s judgment is therefore quite contradictory: it is harassed by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their intimate sphere and private domain suffer from it when they start using Google services. Therefore, they attack them in the spirit of revolt against multinational companies proud of their conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its “savages” bringing together the enthusiasts, activists and enthusiastic computer users who appear in many countries see Google as the next generation of big business, the “connected corporation”, as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, cataloged as an invader of the world because of Windows, even if both fight for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for identification code, does not ask for money for its applications. The documentary code and program package, continuously refreshed, has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect, in the face of the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may also be that geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between human rights and the internet, and what Web 2.0, the most widely proclaimed keyword of recent years, pulls right behind it.
Indeed, Web 2.0 is about nothing more than collaboration, than the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind, and that we use the communication channels at our disposal, and while the dimension of these changes one by one, the essential thing remains the same: we expose ourselves.
A young person, in general, can keep a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Shanghai, and he can even link these to other services, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then, he can link these to a tracking system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also keep photos on Flicks, in which they automatically appear more recent galleries.
While we can get acquainted with many examples, such as that of the girlfriend who easily understands at the sight of the morning photos, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom his unfaithful friend spent the evening, or that of the company that fired one of its employees, just for the sincere opinions that this one wrote on his blog about the top management: we can be totally on a life time.
The one who lives a life online is made up of what he shows of himself, and that is how we can define the principle behind the behavior of today's young people.
He wants to hide something, or at least he wants to try to bypass the monopoly of Google, can do it (starting, for example, with Scroogle, using the Google search system, but, at the same time, intentionally leaving no trace).
The number of people who deliberately do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them, is not in the least. Google online services, from word processing to image processing, to reading information can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not linked to huge fleets of servers and which do not exist better.
Public opinion awaits, without really hiding, the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion). AdWords/AdSense ad domains threaten ad agencies' revenues, while services introduced at an increasing speed cause serious computer programs not only to Microsoft, but to many other creators.
However, critical observers find, besides all this, contradictions with disturbing effects: for example, the top management of the company has refused, in its entirety, the protests of employees, after it has doubled the price of corporate kindergarten and after the company has judged it too expensive the multiple daily catering, taken in front of any 2006.
According to one of the company's internal rules, the new services are not advertised only when they can be used. What is certain is that in the coming months and years, they will move the world on new points. While some think that the project of scanning and archiving books and magazines of Google takes on such important dimensions that the company will soon find itself in front of the United States.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can give a good raw material to the next generation of sci-fi authors. The novel by the famous Cory Doctorow, written with Orwellian halftones, describes the future in which a man could be approached creepyly just through Google data.
Two Miners Helped Disappear the Traces of the Double Killing of ?zd
"The police have summoned two minors to question them in the case of the double murder of Izd. Based on well-founded suspicions, they have helped to remove the traces of the crime," the Borsod department's police station spokesman said.
The young people have acknowledged the facts they are accused of, and for now they are accused of complicity.
The two minors, who, according to information from MTI (Hungarian Telegraphic Agency) are young girls, defend themselves free.
Murder complicity can result in up to 5 years in detention.
The suspect in the double homicide of 23-year-old local man was placed in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicide, committed with premeditation and out of interest.
During the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old owed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay off his debt and it is for this reason that he pulled his creditor last Wednesday to a site in Izd where he killed him, as well as the boy’s 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI information, the young man premeditated his crime, and the weapon with which he was going to commit his crimes hidden at the scene of the crime is proof of this.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange makes a proposal for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has proposed two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the Prague Stock Exchange's stock package.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal that the Poles made despite the fact that the Czechs previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to separate from more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activity.
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the proposal of the Poles represents the highest bid ever made for the purchase of the Prague stock exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made an offer to date.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among those interested, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the new poorest owner, and did not rule out the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated to be between 5 and 10 billion Czech kroner by market specialists.
Based on an agreement between the shareholders, about 90% of the papers would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague stock exchange is investment bank Patria Finance, with about 25 percent stakes, followed by the 14.7 percent of the bank Ceská Sporitelna and the Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
In their comments on Tuesday on the international financial crisis, which is getting worse every day, the leading European newspapers already speak of a "second 9/11".
"The global financial catastrophe, we owe it to the American president," the Rome daily La Repubblica accuses. "The president has not even been able to block with his own party behind a bill, improvised in a hurry, aimed at helping a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as billionaire Warren Buffett put it, it is more appropriate to talk about a second 9/11.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the vision of the daily El Mundo, it is the failures of the political leadership there that have brought the global economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is increasing every day, and eventually, the whole world will pay the heavy price.
Bush’s plan was far from perfect, however, according to the congressional vote, a real danger threatens, one that Washington does not propose a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the void, just at the moment in the history of capitalism, one of the greatest transformations takes place.
We cannot ignore the threat any longer - points out the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states can still hold a lifeline to their reluctant financial organizations, and with their taxpayers' money, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if even more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither financial means nor new improvisations will suffice.
In the long run, we need European Union states to ignore their national selfishness and centralize control over divided financial markets.
On Monday alone, the weakened financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros - said the Vienna daily, Der Standard, who adds that fears that European taxpayers too will have to put their hands on the pocket, very deep, in a similar way to the Americans in order to remedy the crisis, become more and more realistic.
So far, the EU has not really dealt with the crisis, which, like a tsunami, crosses the old continent.
The "saviors" should not immediately weigh a hundred billion euros, but it would be wise if they noted in which case it would be rational to touch taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing further damage.
The smart car imitates the robbery of the bumblebee
What better method would be used to develop technologies capable of avoiding an obstacle than the imitation of an existing obstacle detector in nature?
For example, the bee.
In the amazing project presented at CEATEC, taking place in Japan, buzzing bees gave Nissan engineers the starting strategic idea, to inspire them on how they must design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built a mini-robot car, a bio-inspired self-control system, type BR23C, which it equipped with the qualities of bees, the end goal being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
During its flights, each bee forms its own oval-shaped space, which in reality looks a lot like our secure protective shell - explained, during the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the research and development and public relations technology department of the brand.
The bee’s faceted eye plays a key role, as it is able to see in all directions, at an angle of 300 degrees.
To mimic the functions of the faceted eye, engineers approached the idea of the laser rangefinder.
It identifies obstacles at a 180-degree angle and at a distance of 2 meters in front of the BR23C, evaluates distances and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which transforms it into an avoidance maneuver right away.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second, then the mini-auto robot, mimicking the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it by an angle sufficient to avoid collision.
Unlike any existing system, this avoidance manoeuvre takes place entirely instinctively.
“If it wasn’t, the mini-auto robot wouldn’t be able to react quickly enough to avoid the hurdle,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and Robotic Car Project.
It must react instinctively and instantly, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the protective envelope, a layer where for now the collision is considered inevitable.
This whole process should reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
The process must take place in the blink of an eye.
Contrary to bees, the difference cannot go upwards, downwards or diagonally, it can only be of two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn.
In this way, instead of the endless combinations that bees have to avoid other bees, in our case, we could only use the rotary movement, acceleration as well as slowing down as maneuvers available to the mini auto robot
The BR23C uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy concentration, which makes their life longer than in the lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the instinctive intelligent reaction that is paramount, not the processing of data, let alone the ability to store.
This mechanism must process only a few incoming signals per second, and react to them.
It is not necessary to store them and react with intuitive logic based on the data of previous maneuvers, in this way it uses only a few dozen kilobytes of continuous memory.
You don't need memory of a gigabyte capacity, or even megabytes.
This is the first step towards the design of a technology used for instant avoidance. According to Nissan estimates, this system will enter mass-produced cars in the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to his destination avoiding obstacles in his way.
They even gave the baby a name.
The written version of the $700 billion economic bailout, aimed at buying back the banks’ dubious credits, and using them in multiples, is ready.
In the first round, half of that amount will be spent.
Reuters reports that during new debates that lasted until after midnight on Saturday, Congressional leaders agreed on controversies that had existed for days and days, around the $700 billion bailout plan.
“We’ve taken a serious step forward,” said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic president of the U.S. House of Representatives, who said the deal was only to be put on paper.
The compromise, born out of the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson commented on the results of the compromise that the program will work and be effective, but other measures still need to be implemented. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving Wall Street here, but about turning the wheels of the economy in the other direction.
The written version of the plan was made public prior to the opening of Asian markets on Sunday evening at 8 p.m. local Washington time (i.e. Monday at 2 a.m., depending on local Central European time), but did not cause a dramatic rise in stock markets.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, and then its fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday night, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, then the White House also welcomed the news of the deal.
"We are pleased with the progress made tonight, and we greatly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
In addition, the program diverges from the initial proposal made by the Bush administration, which mentioned that the $700 billion should be spent at once, for the purchase of securities with doubtful credits.
From now on, a maximum of half of the $700 billion can be spent. The first $250 billion will be issued immediately after Congress passed the bill, probably Monday. This first sum will be used by the Secretary of the Treasury to buy up doubtful claims from banks, while the use of the additional $100 billion will be left to the discretion of the President.
The program will be overseen by an independent body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also take part.
The spending of the second half of the $700 billion depends on a new congressional decree.
Under the law, the Treasury Secretariat will be able to put in place a combined strategy: at the same time, it will be able to buy dubious claims, securities related to dubious mortgages and mortgages, as well as other types of "toxic" claims.
The department's competent persons stated that the purchases can take place as part of an auction, but also directly.
The rule allows the companies involved to take part in an insurance program, where the Treasury Secretariat guarantees the tools that cause the concerns, for which the companies will have paid a premium equivalent to the foreseeable damage.
Henry Paulson said the law provides the tools needed to allocate $700 billion for the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it’s the extensive redemption of dubious claims, their insurance, or avoiding the risk of the system collapsing any major financial institution.
“We will take the necessary steps to be prepared for the law as soon as it is signed,” he added.
On the other hand, bank managers who are in a bad position and are waiting for state aid can expect their severance pay, simply called gold parachute across the Atlantic, to be capped by the government.
Wage caps are only mentioned in specific cases, and limitations depend on how the Treasury Secretariat offers assistance to the business.
The cap principle means that if the Treasury Secretariat buys back as part of an auction, they will levy a surcharge on the gold parachute, unless the discredited bank president retires.
Directly after the purchase of the dubious debts, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders is not overstated.
For the image to be complete, it must still be added that the existing golden parachutes are not modified. The cap only concerns the new contracts, this to motivate participation in the plan.
“This is the first time in U.S. history that legal caps will be in place on Directors General’s appointments,” said Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Benefits Committee.
In addition, the government acquires the right to acquire shares in the banks participating in the plan, which reduces the risk of taxpayers, since they can even win in the case as soon as the economy and with it the rescued banks fall back on their feet.
The bill mentions that within the next five years, the President must submit a proposal to Congress that will rule on how losses will be returned to taxpayers, starting from the financial sector.
On both sides, there were obviously those who expressed their doubts about this plan.
That’s not why U.S. citizens have mandated us, it doesn’t protect taxpayer dollars,” said Rep. Darrell Issa.
Her fellow Democrat from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believes that they are the same ones who pressed for the action, as those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Will we still need a visa to go to the United States next year?
Kinga Göncz believes there is a good chance that by January 12, the U.S.-Hungarian visa-free agreement will enter into force, which the Minister of Foreign Affairs said in Chicago, in front of the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
"Now everything depends only on when electronic entry and control systems across the Atlantic are put into operation."
All of a sudden, she drew attention to the fact that in the new system, there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to check in before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will be in talks starting today in Washington.
He will meet Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will hand over the decoration of the Commander's Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will have an interview with the foreign policy advisers of presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support bank bailout
On Sunday, Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major U.S. parties, pledged their support for the government’s $700 billion bailout, but there are politicians who are demanding the resignation of the U.S. Treasury Secretary.
After marathon negotiations that lasted days and days, congressional representatives and the administration finally announced, Sunday at dawn, that they had concluded agreements in principle on the bank bailout plan.
This financing plan, aimed at thawing the Wall Street crisis and the paralyzed credit market, became the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even present themselves, each as more apt than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, with the emphasis on economic issues, Obama once again managed to get a little bit ahead, and McCain’s lead, obtained with the appointment of Sarah Palin as a collister just after the Republican convention, has melted.
At a campaign meeting in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed hope that Congress would quickly vote on the $700 billion bailout bill.
He stressed that the proposal contains the consumer protection passages that he too supports.
"Now is the time to act responsibly ... a danger threatens your work, your economies, the entire industrial sector and the stability of the entire economy," he told a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not fail to describe McCain’s economic ideas as outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: “We will all struggle to swallow it ... but doing nothing is not a possible path.”
The Republican senator stated that the proposal mentioned the creation of a Treasury Board and the cap on senior executive severance pay, and that he was personally very committed to these points.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no substantive role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Treasury Secretary.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that there is serious hope that the House will vote on the bill as early as Monday.
The Press Review of the German Language Territory
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only in the heart of the party that voters have become more aware - this is how the Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarian country, evokes.
Haider is ready to rule Austria, to prevent the Reds and Blacks coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the internet edition of the German left-wing news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The revolution in Bavaria devours its fathers".
According to this renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
Christian socialists have been transforming Bavaria for decades and now it is these same modern citizens who are turning their backs on them.
This change of era is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and therefore also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, failure was not quite a surprise, but on Sunday, a process came to an end that was likely just ten years ago: the undisputed hegemony of the national party was over.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU was picking up at 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the 50 percent level.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, at the time of the much-discussed Stoiber.
The cause can be attributed to the modernization "devouring his parents", established in the region consistently by the CSU.
The sociologists have been announcing this for 40 years, but they have been very wrong about the pace, but the secularization, the results of education and the establishment of North and East Germans in the developing region of Bavaria could not remain without consequences for the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increased opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more aware, more critical and more stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks, it is precisely the groups of classical citizens who have moved away from the CSU, such as freelancers, craftsmen, graduates and graduates.
In these groups, UHC support fell below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
In its article entitled "Who? With whom? The party presidents stand on reserve in the face of coalition issues", the conservative Austrian daily newspaper deals with the confused domestic policy situation that took place after the Austrian elections.
Austrian SPÖ Socialists want to talk to the ÖVP Conservatives.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
The populist BZÖ party is open for negotiations. The Greens still do not want to agree on the coalition.
Elections have taken place, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debates held on public television, the party leaders have barely let their cards shine.
SPÖ President Werner Faymann confirmed that he would like to speak with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is indeed possible - this is what already exists in some regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question of whether he would envision a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current ÖVP president, as vice-chancellor, remains open on Faymann’s part.
As he mentioned, the Schüssel-Molterer approach was, in any event, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of the question.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the proposals of the Reds.
As he has already said, a collaboration will surely be unsuccessful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
In his party, the choice of the opposition or the choice of joining the coalition is for the moment an open question, which must be discussed in the ÖVP.
BZÖ President Jörg Haider is once again open to all proposals.
"To avoid the Red and Black coalition, we are ready to assume government responsibilities," Haider said.
Járóka said: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities began, hosted by France, as the representative of the current Presidency of the European Union.
In her message to the plenary, as one of the main spokesmen of the expert consultation, Livia Járóka, MEP Fidesz European People's Party, drew attention to segregation in education, because it is a violation of the right that most affects Roma children and therefore, one of the main barriers to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among those invited to participate in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most eminent representatives of legal protection and European civil bodies, in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Fidesz People's Party group, Járóka warned that alongside the distinctions seen during the hirings, Roma disappear from the labour market, first of all, due to their low qualifications.
"An overwhelming majority of young Roma do not have high school degrees, and as a result of poor elementary education, only a tiny fraction has the opportunity to earn a graduate degree."
Furthermore, Járóka stressed that education as a basic human right plays a key role when it comes to asserting other fundamental rights.
Investing in early education of Roma children means strengthening the economy of the member countries of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these reports in the widest possible circle, also between Roma and non-Roma.
Indeed, the sooner a Roma child starts school, the greater his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; through taxes paid from his income and consumption, he participates in the state budget.
“Because of their European Union nationality, Roma must be assured of their right to quality education, and be protected from low-quality and sectarian education,” said Lívia Járóka.
According to the MEP, the European Union must work together with a goal and action to speed up the process of desegregation of schools, so that compliance with existing and in preparation anti-discrimination directives is of paramount importance.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, and give the opportunities provided by democracy to Roma children, so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe" - demanded Járóka.
In the name of the "European Year for Equal Opportunities" for All, the objective of the Equal Opportunities Summit in Europe held every year since the Berlin Summit last year is to ensure a single platform to support the measures taken to promote equal opportunities and combat discrimination, targeted at European level and at the level of member countries.
CSU: Grace for a Transition Period
In October, the decision on the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be taken.
Despite this pitiful election failure, heads have not fallen yet, and the debate on personal issues at the Bavarian CSU summits has been adjourned.
The party president, Erwin Hube, and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still retain their place. The question is how long will the grace last?
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a catastrophic 17 percent loss of voice, will be on the agenda of the exceptional party congress, held on the last weekend of October.
The members of this highly criticized pair have, in any case, made them feel that they did not hold especially to their seat.
Thanks to this, they worked to appease the angry members of the faction and the base, who one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, at the height of his career - the socio-Christian union won 60.7 percent, while today, a year after the coup against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent of their strength remains.
For 46 years, the CSU was Bavaria’s “only sovereign” giving 18 percent of Germany’s GDP.
But the Conservatives still count heavily on this southern region, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, and in the future they will be forced into the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal reorganization of the party, the vice-president and the Federal Minister of Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as the possible successor to Huber, also received a place in this modest group of recognition, which initiates tempting discussions with the FDP Liberals, as well as with the Free Electors, formed along the values of the right, about
A strange facet of fate was that with the help of the list of Free Electors, Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stroiber served as a putsch possibility perpetrated by the Huber-Beckstein duo, entered the legislation, and then treated the very ambitious municipal politician without neglect.
Now, CSU leaders are putting all their energy into stabilizing, in one way or another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who until now was pulling the strings behind the scenes, will also receive an active role. The former head of regional government and former president of the CSU, designated September 28 as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some sharp remarks to the CDU, which he said would have earned much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and also to Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections in September 2009, Merkel will again be able to be chancellor only if they restore somehow, with a common force, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, hardly concealing her disappointment caused by the fiasco, the CSU’s loss of ground will not negatively influence the Berlin grand coalition.
Yet this is relative because it will not be easier to manage the injured CSU, and the socio-democratic crisis still lasts.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - his rivals: 110 - 0
No opposition MPs entered the Belarusian parliament after Sunday's election.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by a country led by Alexander Lukashenko, which ensures prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained by illegalities committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the legislature of 110 people in this country of 10 million inhabitants has been doing very well in opposition for many decades, before yesterday's elections, the opposition uniting its forces under the name of United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, renewing his mandate as president for the fourth time in this dubious election, on the heels of the 2006 constitution.
In this way, the ODSZ renounced its originally planned boycott.
The fact that Belarus, economically dependent more and more on Russia, would like to improve its relations with the EU, where because of the Belarusian political order called anti-democratic, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians do not receive an entry visa, was one of the expectations of the opposition.
The fact that the OSCE, in evaluating the campaign, focused on positive change rather than shortcomings, such as the ban on running for one-third of opposition candidates, was a reference to prior appeasement.
However, the OSCE communiqué on Monday already challenged the campaign, during which most of the opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and especially the fact that the opposition could not be present during the counting of the votes.
Despite all this, the opposition still feels a palpable improvement in the political regime: the political detainees have regained freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, still refusing to recognize South Ossetia and Abazzia separated from Georgia.
“We have taken two steps forward, and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue has begun between Belarus and the EU,” Milinkevitch told the newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate of the presidential elections of 2006, it is desirable that this remains so, despite the fact that "the power has been afraid in this parliament that has no weight, to bring even one opponent in".
The opposition does not foresee any protest actions in the light of the results, but rather tries to convey its message about the need for economic reforms to voters.
"Of course, we have a lot of worries on that side: we have to get our opposition newspapers printed in Russia, local authorities put sticks in the wheels when it comes to broadcasting, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting elections, even in the circle of the elderly.
“Due to the country’s debt and rising trade deficit, the collapse of social security, ‘evoking the silence of a cemetery,’ is only a matter of time,” Milinkevitch said.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in deeds." In this way, the absence of opposition is only proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work".
Never, in the history of the Chigi Palace, did we have rotary doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But from today, this new measure is in force against the smart little ones, against whom points and then goes to drink coffee at the bar during working hours.
The anti-lazy novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
“The revolving doors,” says Brunetta, “are an instrument for better work, with more productivity, more presences and more services.”
Now begins a new season of accountability and transparency.
"It's reformism," Brunetta said.
The installation in all the establishments of the Presidency of the Council is completed with the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, "the choice of rotary doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance from employees was registered, the secretary general assures: "it is a process shared by employees, and we have had the collaboration of all".
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee or croissant.
Brunetta’s promise, which she suggests with a smile, “a good cappuccino at 7 a.m. is an excellent and healthy resolution.”
At a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
In Rome, the minister reported that “in three months, the absences of sickness of public employees have decreased by 50%, or 60 thousand more workers in one year”.
And he adds that it is essential to make more effective, the Public Administration .
Italy, "whose wage dynamics - explains the minister - the last 8-10 years have doubled compared to the private sector, and much more than inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees came together to challenge the standards of the Brunetta decree using the Codacons.
""while the Minister of Public Service is now releasing data on the decline in absenteeism in the workplace due to illness - writes the association of consumers - the people of "lazy active" continues to increase.
Indeed, in Italy, thousands of correct and productive Public Administration employees have gathered to declare war on the illegitimate standards contained in the decree.
In particular, in the Tar, the exclusion of additional allowances in the event of disability due to service is contested; the extension of the hours of the sick worker's residence, during which the inspection visits are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions requested by the minister.
Workplace Accidents, Napolitano: "Critical Prevention"
Every day in Italy there are 2,500 accidents at work, 3 deaths and 27 people who remain permanently disabled.
In 2007, Inail data confirmed that white deaths were around 1,200.
Figures that show the severity of the phenomenon that remains one of the leading causes of death, and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To get the attention of institutions, social forces and the media on this dramatic aspect, the Anmil celebrates today, in all Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of Victims of Accidents at Work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The disturbing data released by the Anmil, as well as the tragic events of the last few days, confirm the importance of the topic of prevention in the workplace," said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the president of the Anmil, National Association of the mutilated and disabled at work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "sincere appreciation for the continuing effort of the association in favour of prevention in the workplace, protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of the victims and awareness of public opinion"
"Naturally outraged, everyone has punched in the fist to put an end to such tragedies that, by their size, spark the clamor of the media and the participation of public opinion, even if the daily reality presents us with dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a resource problem: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness on the part of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty to pay attention to this phenomenon, not to underestimate the alarm about social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
For his part, the President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed how "this phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each of us, and requires all institutions to make a concrete effort to end it quickly".
The data of the accidents on the job seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths is still impressive "suddenly stressed the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want this 'rebate trend' to translate into a minor attention, because it is precisely when attention relaxes, that tragedy happens.
"We believe that in general, we do not do enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be achieved through multiple actions."
“In our view, more checks and inspections are needed, as well as more intervention on training workers, right from school,” Mercandelli said.
- He added - "that further efforts should be made with regard to communication and public awareness.
"But above all, we need a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in the face of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the conditions for safeguarding the compensation provided for the victims of work" and the "drift of assistance to which the system has been oriented in recent years".
“The aim, therefore, is to give the worker the guarantee of insurance so that the fate of the person who has an accident should not depend on the spontaneity or enlargement of the legislator.”
Mp3 player pointing fingers, they put hearing at risk.
Listening to music at full volume for an extended period using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
This is what the European Commission announces, which, in a statement released in Brussels, cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee, on the unforeseen and recently identified health risks (Csrseri) of the EU, published today.
“From this scientific report, 5-10% of those who over a period of at least 5 years listen to full-volume music using portable music devices for more than an hour a day and a week are at risk of permanent hearing loss.”
“I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use mobile music devices and full-volume mobile phones may unconsciously damage their hearing irreparably,” Kuneva said.
“According to scientific data, this is a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
What matters most is raising consumer awareness and making this information public.
In addition, we need to review the existing control systems in the light of scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can follow the new technologies."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable music devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they generate.
"The scientists confirm that there are good reasons to be concerned, and that the European Commission will now discuss with Member States and other stakeholders, what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable music devices and similar devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100Db, but there is growing concern about hearing damage that could result from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
It is possible to limit these data using solutions such as reducing levels and duration of exposure to noise.
The EU Scientific Committee notes that users of portable music devices, who listen to music at full volume (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, exceed the current limits for the maximum noise level in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for prolonged periods, risk a permanent loss of hearing ability after 5 years.
This is of interest to 5-10% of the users of these devices, and their number can be quantified to around 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno gave the order to start the Commission for the future of the capital.
Today we start, in March we end, in June we will draw the sums.
This is the timetable set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capitale", which took place this morning, in the new seat, behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other members of the Commission will finalise the directives for Rome.
In March, when they are finished, the Committee and the City Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, in order to present in June, the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented - it would like to emphasize Alemanno - it will have to propose ideas for the development of Rome that can be used by the political decision-makers, who remain the Committee and the Communal Council.
No superimposition of roles, but only the desire to have a corner where to elaborate a great project for Rome.
In March, she will finish her tasks and then disappear, because this experience must have a precise time duration.
In June, the mayor announced, we will present the strategic plan derived from the work carried out by the Commission for the future of Rome Capitale. "
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, as well as the quality of its proposals.
If quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is burdened by the day-to-day management and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look forward, and further, to a deeper perspective, working seriously to the development of Rome and its future.
Moreover, the mayor of Rome wishes to emphasize that "this Commission is not an unnecessary body or a bureaucratic whole: it is absolutely free, and will not cost a euro to the Roman city dwellers, and will serve to study and involve the best intelligences who express the Capital.
For Alemanno, in fact, "it takes a draft strategic reference, neither firm nor stationary, in order to allow our city to improve, what it absolutely needs, while thinking about its future now a unitary spirit, ".
A future that, according to the Mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the usual communal borders, but that will look further" not only from the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as a capital, but "also in relation to the role that Rome can and should have, as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. That’s why.
A famous American politician who wants to be considered independent, wrote: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, because of his decisions, destroyed the U.S. economy and had relations (as he still has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Attacks on Obama are on the rise as the election date draws closer.
A Miami woman wrote on a website: “This person is full of ambition.”
“Obama is really brazen: he believes he will win the highest office in a nation that counts in all, two governors and five black senators!”
In reality, these are attacks that do not say much; they are obviously attacks of a racial nature, and do not answer the question of all voters: will he be a good president? We also have the polls, which all say that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case, it is still someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the bowels of the southern United States, wrote an article: once in the voting booth, we know well who the American patriot will vote for.
Here is an aspect of the American mentality that has remained secret until the end.
“Whatever you want, we’ll see to it that we put the cross on Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear that if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things never revealed before, so much so that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
Anyway, for all these reasons, the winning card for the Democrats is George Bush.
1,500 people were asked: what were the mistakes Bush made during his tenure? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was kicked back in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Despite this, Iraq was, for the most part, Bush’s weakness.
Whoever takes the place of George W will have a huge task to accomplish.
In the U.S., the economic debacle is felt even among journalists: in the press, it is time for suppressions. And many accuse the Internet, this "murderer" of the newspaper.
Five hundred American journalists have been questioned by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mind control for the future.
Almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, they have not openly stated to the press that they are less concerned about credibility.
They don’t feel as isolated as they used to.
The problem with American journalists is money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model.
In addition, the deletions made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to assemble the newspapers, are a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if it is to be desired that traditional journalism as the general public hears it, is not reduced significantly.
An obvious but complex pessimism invades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and newspaper journalists are convinced that national journalism is on the wrong track.
Locally, the executive group is at 65%.
Printed publication against broadcast.
Journalists don’t have a hard time seeing where the web is going.
The biggest publishing houses are making a switch to the Internet, perceived by many as the "assassin" of the newspaper.
The “economic pressure” felt by journalists has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to getting into technology hoping it would “do something good” for their journalism.
Today, the biggest catch in American journalism lies between those who run the newsrooms – that is, the directors – and the reporters who work for them.
56% of directors at national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at local level this percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this is related to “work safety”.
Managers who think they will lose their jobs within 3 years are 47% nationally.
As far as journalists are concerned, it is 30%.
“Safe Work” at the staff level in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the U.S., with 300 million people and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it quickly becomes a matter of taking or leaving.
Managers almost always receive high salaries, while the writer can earn $10 thousand a month in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
As for the holidays, the logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in all, passed a certain number of years.
But according to their revelations, American journalists are often “sick” during the year.
It is the fault of the climate.
UNIPOL:TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA REMAINS A GROTTAFERRATA.
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the case of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had asked to be able to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a dwelling in Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy under the Unipol-Bnl Escalation Instruction.
At his trial last week, he was granted house arrest and made a mandatory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate agent be allowed to travel the route from the provincial city to a home in the capital.
According to the court, such travel (which the PM did not grant) would allow him to influence his society and have access to evidence accusing him.
Elites are in danger.
The phenomenon was already manifested a few days ago, with the House vote, contrary to the $700 billion bailout approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and still are, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the American economy.
And it is the New York Times of yesterday that confirms this by communicating that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more divided between its moderate East Coast soul, favorable to the federal institutions as well as the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to "the ones of Washington" and the world of finance, powerful especially in the Central and Southern States.
The soul, precisely, which made itself felt despotically with the vote I was talking about at the beginning.
However, what has just been mentioned is only one example of the changes, the great changes that the current economic earthquake predicts or already lets go: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and maybe not only here.
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to be accelerating the phenomena that have been brewing for some time, to the point that, in the new climate, they are solidifying and revealing themselves.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary stimulus, of the dual state-sovereign category, in relation to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions that obviously have close relations with abroad, but which, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balance sheets of individuals and families who live in one country, in one state.
This immediately creates a political problem for which it governs: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of individuals and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically, it is almost only here national.
Political internationalisation seems really out of the question or does not have much to say: the obvious evidence is provided by the European Union, which, shared as usual, among the various interests and between the various national strategies, is unable to decide any common political line.
And so it is from the government of each state that everyone expects interventions, rescue and stimulus plans, new rules, and above all a credit affection: when we are going through a difficult period, there are only the states that have the economic resources, the mass of financial resources capable of trying to put things back in place.
They also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of inestimable value, elements that no market or international organization can ever have in a similar way.
This new emphasis of the nation-state crisis is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the ever-major importance that the more recent economic developments of the economy tend to attribute to a factor quite linked to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, indeed, while we were convinced that we were now entering the realm of the network, of increasingly sophisticated technology, of the non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized at once, that our future will instead have to settle its accounts more and more with the rather intangible things like water, harvest.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth, but that are absolutely linked to a confined space, to a territory.
So, who is sovereign, certainly has more cards than the one who is not, that is, the one who has the misfortune to live in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
Now I come to the second novelty, which, however, foresees a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to take charge of the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaderships, economic species that have proven inadequate and full of shadows.
And in addition, something even deeper, in a sense, even worrying: discredit, suffering, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance that tends to involve the entire class of directors in a growing number of Western countries.
Thus the conviction of the various classes increases even more, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elites until now at their peak, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to be ever more foreign to the opinions of the majorities.
In short, the demand for leadership, feeds underground, a powerful and branched movement of delegitimizations of either the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which manifest themselves in the improvised electoral "revolts" or else, in the collective mood changes of recent times, from the conservative rise in Austria to Bavaria, to the fall of the Greater Labour Party.
One has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, someone would say, have more and more difficulty, which does not date from today, to understand and therefore to represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis increases and increases and potentially unravels.
In view of all this, talking about a current "rebellion of the masses" on the agenda seems frankly exaggerated.
But we say well, keep your eyes wide open, it is not without reason.
The superglue to walk on the walls.
Defeat the laws of gravity with super glue and, in the future, walk on walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various American research centers, and today, a team of four institutes has almost succeeded.
With an adhesive measuring just 2.5 square centimetres, the researchers managed to keep a body of 100 kilograms glued to a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know who use a particular structure of carbon, called nano carbon tubes.
"The glue principle can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a spaghetti pile." explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of the geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that ensure the animal is a perfect adherent.
Tests on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, that it “is easily detached from the wall,” says Liming Dai, a research fellow at the University of Dayton’s Faculty of Engineering.
"This material could be used as a temporary adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on walls like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, since carbon nanotubes are conductive of heat and electric current.
Other applications may include aerospace engineering.
So far, no superheroes.
OTHER RESEARCH- The University of Berkeley, California, is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, California researchers presented a microfiber-like adhesive that cleans itself of dust during movement on a surface to ensure perfect and constant adhesion.
Medications: never with fruit juice.
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in the summer because they are soothing and rich in vitamins, if combined with certain vital drugs, alter their absorption amplifying or decreasing their effectiveness, with even serious consequences for health.
David Nailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices whether they are in a box or fresh, whether they are associated with the ingestion of certain drugs; during the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he launches a new alarm: just a glass of grapefruit juice and grapefruit juice.
Grapefruit juice has already been heavily criticized as being held responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, anti-stem and neurological drugs to toxic levels.
It was the Italian Medicines Agency itself, which had given the news in a two-year newsletter, warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger arising from this mix and to pay attention to what we drink, if we take medicines such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT PAMPLEMOUSE- According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit drugs.
Long is the list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology at the Public University of Milan, said: “These findings are usually immediately reported to the various national and international drug agencies that will need to change the information notes of the drugs.
It is always necessary to read the illustrative papers of the drugs that are taken, and, if something is not clear, not to be impressed, but to address clearly to the doctor or pharmacist," the expert pointed out to the Ansa agency.
Nobel Prize in Economics by Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his research on business models and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a famous New York Times columnist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during the days of Enron’s bankruptcy, Krugman had written, in an article published in the New York Times, that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A prediction that triggered many polemics, and that was blamed to the economist for years, but that has now proved to be accurate.
“I am surprised and even a little shocked at how quickly the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom disappeared from public attention,” Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a “high-value economist” but also a very aggressive divulgeer, especially critical of the excesses of the Bush administration’s liberalism.
Open Office is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
This is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the personal productivity open source suite that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work, done by voluntary developers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package is shown to the general public with various novelties: from the welcome screen, and the interface revised and became less austere, to more important ones, such as compatibility born for the operating system Apple Mac OS X, and support for the new Format Document version 1.2.
Open Office has paid particular attention to the interaction with the 2007 Office suite, and it is indeed possible to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting, some functions specific to some modules, such as the one that allows to reduce the dimensions of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, to send them by email, or to import PDF files in the graphical processing module, keeping the original appearance of the page.
Also on this front, it is possible to create "hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical graphic of the Adobe format with elements of a spreadsheet or a word processor.
Collaboration between multiple people is an element that has had various improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts about changes, in the elaboration of texts, because each employee is assigned a color of comments for better recognition during the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to bring certain OpenOffice features to the web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks, they are expected to issue the final result.
The Italian version is available for download at http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is added to the English version that has been on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the sequel is as usual available in addition, for the Linux operating system.
Upon request, the installation CD can be shipped home or to the workplace.
And if the theme of free can be a means to disseminate it in homes, it is precisely in business, that Open Office tries the big challenge, already able to count on various projects carried out in public administration and schools.
Not to mention the realities that offer a training, consultation and support service, ideal for small and medium-sized businesses, which could also open up to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for equivalent video writing of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for rival PowerPoint presentations; Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows you to work on databases; finally Drwa is the graphic module.
Goal for 2008, reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today there are almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the expected figure
Kohl, too, is positive, this is the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: this is Austrian team Gerolsteiner, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
It is the website of the daily L'Equipe that reports the news.
At 26, Kohl is the fourth positive rider at Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and the German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The blood tests carried out on Kohl’s specimens are among those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analysis confirms the positivity at Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place in the Tour and will have to wait for two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl’s positivity to the third generation Epo was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who communicated to the Associated Press, having notified the positivity to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, taking off the jersey with the dots of the best climber.
IMMIGRES:NEW YORK TIMES IS IT RACIST?
Italy "as a country of emigrants has recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with reluctance.
The New York Times has dedicated a long article discussing the subject of racism in Italy, starting with the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, who was killed last month in Milan, for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "paradox of the north": the northern regions are both the ones where there is "more integration and more work", but also "the strongest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the most important support for the Northern Lega"
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also referred to the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
Even the new legislature wanted by the Lega to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is cited as evidence of the climate change in Italy.
The Pope and the President of the Republic underlined this trend: "Giorgio Napolitano, during his meeting with Benedict XVI in the Quirinal, asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism."
Students victims of expensive rents, up to 900 euros for a room.
The student rental market is not experiencing a crisis
According to the latest Sunia investigation, the tenants’ union, renting a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to the point of excluding entire categories of young people, from the right to study because of the very high overall costs that the families of origin have to incur - explains the head of the Sunia study office, Laura Mariani - in these cities, the high demand from the students has distorted the market so much that a process of general increase has been initiated for the same reason.
In most cases, rental offers also involve a series of violations: free type contracts, unregistered, no rent limit, sublet.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the revision of the tax, are necessary to calm prices.
Reading in detail the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room, we go from 650 euros minimum (Black Band area), to an average value of 800 (Lambiate area, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria area)
In Florence, a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas near the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, and from 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, in the areas near the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), about 600 euros is required for a single, 450 for a bed in a double.
Slightly lower values (550 euros for a single) for areas close to other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You can save only if you go away in the peripheral areas:300 euros for a bed, and 450 for a single in the area Predesta, Centocelle or similar.
In Naples, for a bed it takes 300/400 euros, for a single, we spend 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari, for bed, it takes 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of major importance in the city economy.
Finally, in cities such as Perugia, where rentals are often taken by non-community students, there is a subsequent anomaly: the rent demanded by foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that applied to Italians.
Farewell old Paradiso cinema, cities eliminate historic halls.
Historic cinemas close in favor of Multiplex.
“A city without cinemas is a blind city, it’s like a face without eyes.”
The image provided by the director Giuseppe Tornatore illustrates well what is happening in the major Italian urban centers, but also in the provincial cities,
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth on the periphery of large multi-rooms, and the death of mono-room consumption in the central areas of cities, is one of the major events that seems inevitable and indisputable to us; it also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
Disappearing, they are often historical places and full of memory, "it is as if one of my friends disappears, someone we know, with whom we have shared a path and so many emotions" observes the director of the Nuovo Cine Paradiso, film that offers to Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar as well as the Grand Prix of the Cannes jury, and who always told the film.
The figures provided by Anec, the main trade association, mean everything: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and it is the cinemas of the main cities that have paid the most the costs: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closure, Emilia Romaine leads with 82 mono cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The evidence confirms that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, because it is the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-room cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany as in Emilia-Romagna.
“Italian exploitation has developed irrationally,” observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, “it is useful to build new structures, but we should still guarantee the survival of those that already exist, because when a room is closed in a city, these frequenters are not necessarily all willing to go to the multiplexes.
Not to mention the missed deliberation of the credit in favor of traders: the previous debt of the State is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, it would take between 16 and 18 million euros per year.
Note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, worried about these closures, decided to solve the situation through the signing of a protocol between City Hall and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and promote mono cinemas in historic centers and on the outskirts.
Among the regulations planned, there are measures of tax facilities for managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area, and will have special rates for parking lots and in certain parking lots.
"This is an initiative that I like," observes Giuseppe Tornatore "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna implementing other measures.
It is obvious, however, that to contrast the super power of multiplexes, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, as today’s audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema de Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to do "New Cinema Paradiso" that I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, I turn to the other side not to see the signs blackened by the dust.
Links between politics and ‘ndrangheta, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro.
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to align the choices of the City Hall with the interests of the Piromalli clan."
The mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition for mafia association.
The controllers also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and public administrations, and his son-in-law, homonymous with the boss, already sentenced for association of mafia-type criminals, as well as to pay 10 million euros.
"an affront to legal and moral norms, and above all common sense," write the prosecutors, the two local administrations had expressed the willingness to pay consultations to Master Piromalli.
“So it would have been granted to the clan,” the judges write, “to officially enter the town halls facilitating the already considerable possibilities of control and guidance of the public administration.”
Agazio Loiero, president of the Calabrian regional committee, does not hide that "collusion between local committees and organized crime, there are more than one" in his region: "there are places where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also a lot of politicians who resist the pressures of the Andrangheta, heroes who are honest.”
The arrests this morning follow those of last July, following which police announced that they had beheaded the Piromalli clan.
By the end of April last, Gioia Tauro's municipal council had been dissolved; already in 1991, and still because of alleged conditioning between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been discharged from their function of administering the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the SVP at the time of the dissolution, had been appointed head of a center-right coalition, after the May 2006 flogging.
He cried out for scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He accused the deputy interior minister at the time, Marco Minniti, of manipulating everything for a political issue, but given the request for incarceration signed this morning, the judges explained that the Piromalli clan had even managed to request the variation of the A3 project.
Starting from the interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the pm write, emerged "the willingness to marry the demands of a businessman, representing a more well-known group, close to the Piromalli, uniforming the choices of the public administration to the interests of the clan.
When the energy is born from the waves, now the big ones are launching.
This is a huge deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and now the world's major energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources on which colossians like Chevron have laid their eyes, and now they are trying to get their hands on them.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for hundreds of years now, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the price of oil dropped around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now the environmental authorities and the new increase in oil give the sector a big boost.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15% of the world’s electricity needs could be met by sea swell operating systems.
That would be twice the amount produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, there would be currents and tides.
Colossians on the attack.
The first company to focus on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When the deal was announced, it seemed like a real revolutionary step.
Two years after that, more and more candidates among these companies that have always been dedicated to traditional energy are betting on marine energy.
“Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies,” a spokesman for a company associated with the U.S. oil giant told the Wall Street Journal, “and it is evaluating opportunities to cooperate with us.”
The cooperation in question involves obtaining a deliberate permit from the US Energy Commission, necessary to give rise to a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially considering that precisely in Alaska, the US continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush has put in place a project for new excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there are Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, which travel the way of energy from the sea, and the amounts invested to date, although their details are not known, according to observers, a growing interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts are talking about a technology still in its infancy, aside from the fact that marine energy does not dispel fears about the environmental impact.
At present, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small in size, and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, you need to use technologies with a superior environmental impact.
"And the choices are diverse: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The thrust of the waves, which causes the mud to move up and down, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
Pressure turns a turbine, which in turn powers a generator.
The energy is sent to the shore via underwater cables.
For now, we have four such systems in the project phase, pending a single federal approval, and some of the energy could be used for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a shopping mall and parking lot using six underwater turbines from New York’s East River.
The movement of the water during the tides, turns the blades of the turbines, creating a rotational movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant has announced that it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to draw energy.
After the waves, the tides.
Particular interest, they say at the Institute for Electrical Energy Research, deserves at the moment, the potential of the tides.
Although this is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable from wind, sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it is precisely on the energy of the tides that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others, look to the coasts, have invested $7.5 million in 2008 and plans to invest up to $35 million in 2009.
