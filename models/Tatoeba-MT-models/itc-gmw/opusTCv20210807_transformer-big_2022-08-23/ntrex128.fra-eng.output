Members of the Assembly of Wales worried about ‘passing as puppets’
Welsh politicians are appalled by a proposal to replace their title with the acronym MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal stems from the proposed amendment to the name of the assembly, which would become the Welsh Parliament.
In the political sphere, some members of the Assembly believe that this could be the subject of ridicule.
A Labour elected official said his group was concerned that the acronym “rites with Twp and Pwp.”
For non-Welsh readers: in Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means crutch.
According to one of its members, the Plaid Cymru (Wales Party) is not "satisfied" and has proposed other formulas.
The Conservative party would be “open” to a name change, but noted that between MWP and Muppet, the distance is narrow.
In this context, in Welsh, the letter w is pronounced as the letter u in English from the Yorkshire area.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently preparing legislation introducing the name change, stated that “the final decision on the nomination of the members of the Assembly rests with them”.
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to designate the Assembly as the Welsh Parliament, which was widely supported.
On the issue of the title of members, the Commission leans in favour of Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP); however, a vast majority of Welsh prefer MWP.
It seems that the members of the Assembly are making other suggestions, but the effort to reach a consensus could prove to be a real headache for Elin Jones, the Speaker of the Assembly, who is expected to submit a bill on the change of name in the coming weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the functioning of the assembly, including rules on the exclusion of members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will make the final decision on the issue of the name in the debates on the bill.
Macedonia: referendum on changing the country's name
Macedonians will decide on Sunday whether their country should now bear the name "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was held in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute between the country and its Greek neighbor, for whom Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
For a long time, Athens has insisted that the name Macedonia is a claim on its territory and has repeatedly imposed its veto on the accession of its neighbour to the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the referendum, said he would not take the results into account.
However, supporters such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev maintain that the name change is only a small price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
Harlem: Churches in difficulty, bells of Saint Martin silenced
“The elderly people I talked to say that traditionally there was a bar and a church on every street corner,” Adams says.
“There aren’t any more today.”
According to him, it is normal that the bars have become rarefied.
“We don’t date in the same way anymore,” he says.
“We used to go to the bar like his neighbor’s, but that’s not the case anymore.”
As for the churches, the funds from the sale of buildings will run out much sooner than the officials think, and it worries him: "Sooner or later, they will return to the starting square."
He adds that churches could be replaced by condominium complexes, inhabited by individuals who will not help maintain the last shrines in the neighborhood.
“The people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will largely be white people who will hasten the closure of all the churches, as they are unlikely to become members,” he said.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, white congregations built the two churches: Metropolitan Community in 1870, and Saint Martin 10 years later.
The original white Methodist congregation abandoned the site in the 1930s.
A black congregation, preaching nearby, took possession of the building.
The Church of St. Martin was taken over by a black community under the direction of Rev. John Howard Johnson, who initiated a boycott of the shops on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, in which blacks struggled to get employment or to get a promotion.
In 1939, a fire ravaged the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners were preparing to rebuild and ordered a new bell.
Father Johnson's son and successor to the leadership of St. Martin's Church, the Reverend David Johnson, proudly called the "bells of the poor."
Tiffany Ng (University of Michigan), the professional who played it in July, gave it a completely different name: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
She also mentions that it is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, took his place in front of the largest carillon in Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather says Saint Martin did not replace him.
In recent months there has been much talk of the riot between architects and entrepreneurs, caused by the secular elite of the church on one side, and the episcopal diocese on the other.
In July, the parish council, a governing body composed of lay leaders, informed the diocese that it was concerned that the latter wanted to impose on it the costs incurred, even though it did not participate in the recruitment of professionals.
Some parishioners have lamented the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
13-Year-Old Boy Injured by Shark During Lobster Fishing Game
Authorities said a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old on Saturday while fishing for lobster in California on the opening day of the season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help and started paddling up to him to get him out of the water.
At first, Chad thought the boy was shouting for joy at having a shot, then he realized that in reality he
He had been bitten.
Upon arriving near the young man, Hammel noticed that he had an open fracture of the collarbone.
“I was screaming for everyone to get out of the water: There’s a shark!” says Chad.
The boy was evacuated to the Rady Children Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The species of shark that caused the attack is unknown.
At a news conference, rescue chief Larry Giles reported that a shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but that it was not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities closed access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours, for investigation as well as for security reasons.
Giles indicated that there are more than 135 species of sharks, but that most are considered non-dangerous.
Sainsbury's offensive plans in the British aesthetics market
Sainsbury's handmade bass on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and stuffs them with shelves similar to supermarkets, filled with cosmetics and managed by specialists in the field.
As part of a major breakthrough in the UK aesthetics market of GBP 2.8 billion, which continues to grow as fashion and homeware sales are falling, more extensive beauty product shelves will be tested in 11 stores and applied to others if the experience proves conclusive.
Supermarkets are now investing in the beauty market in order to reuse the space previously occupied by TVs, microwaves and other household items.
Sainsbury’s said it would increase the volume of its offerings to 3,000 cosmetic items, which will include for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space in areas similar to those of shops such as Boots.
The supermarket also revives its makeup line Shop to offer a majority of products not tested on animals, an increasingly important criterion among young consumers.
In addition, perfume seller Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first opened last week in Croydon, South London, and a second one scheduled to open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Supermarket managers need to dig their heads to attract consumers, who are increasingly tending to shop online and head to local shops for everyday food products.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said outlets will increasingly resemble grocery stores as the supermarket chain tries to counter discount stores Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury’s has set up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also opened the doors of several Habitat stores, since the two chains were purchased two years ago, which the group says has boosted sales of everyday consumer goods and made the acquisitions profitable.
Previous attempts to restructure the shelves of pharmaceuticals and cosmetics of the British chain had ended in failure.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's attempted a partnership with Boots, but it came to an end following a controversy over the distribution of profits from supermarket pharmacies.
It was after selling its 281 pharmacies for 125 million pounds to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical chain, three years ago that the new strategy was implemented.
Lloyds was to play a role in introducing a wide range of high-end skin care brands in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer of Sainsbury's, announced that the appearance of beauty product shelves has been modified to improve the environment for customers.
“We have also invested in training so that our staff can offer expert advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all types of needs and, thanks to the beautification of our shelves and the ideal location of our establishments, our dominance in the cosmetics market is now undeniable and changes buying habits,” added Mills-Hicks.
Peter Jones' Anger over Holly Willoughby's Withdrawal from $11 Million Deal
Wrath of Dragon's Den star Peter Jones, after the announcement of the withdrawal of host Holly Willoughby of a contract of up to 11 million pounds related to her home decoration brand, to devote herself to her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to take care of the brand of interior decoration and Truly accessories.
The activity of the two protagonists has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced on Instagram that she was retiring.
Holly Willoughby made Dragon's Den star Peter Jones furious by stepping out of their successful last-minute textile and interior design business to focus on her new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was furious when the TV’s darling child revealed, at a live meeting at the Dragon’s Den star’s trading empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new contracts, worth 1.5 million pounds, no longer allowed him to take care of Truly, their brand of decoration and interior accessories.
The Truly brand has been equated with actress Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop and could have doubled the value of the hostess’ fortune estimated at $11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones jumped in her private jet to join one of her second homes outside of Britain.
According to one source, “Truly was by far one of Holly’s priorities.
and about to secure its future for the next two decades.
His decision left everyone speechless.
No one could have imagined what was going to happen on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
Marlow’s headquarters is filled with ready-to-sell products.”
Experts believe that the departure of This Morning’s host, who is among Britain’s most “bankable” celebrities, could cause the company to lose millions, due to significant investments in products ranging from cushions or candles, to clothing or interior items, and the risk of a delayed launch.
This could end a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, parents of three children, have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016; Jones, 52, joined the group as president in March of the same year.
The couples went on vacation together and Peter Jones held 40% of the shares in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby is expected to become the brand ambassador for M&S and will take over from Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity program.
A source close to Jones said last night he did not want to comment on his business activities.
The debate was heated, but in the end we adored each other.
Trump mocked the media who criticize him for his comment that some consider “unworthy of a president,” and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
“Why did President Trump give up so much?”
He laughed, taking the voice of a TV journalist.
“I didn’t give up at all.”
He said Kim Jong-un had been in favour of holding a second meeting, after Trump called the first, which took place in Singapore in June, a big step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the negotiations for such denuclearization are at a standstill.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s chief diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that he saw no “corresponding response” from the United States to North Korea’s first disarmament measures.
He regretted that, on the contrary, the United States continued to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
In his rallying speech Trump offers a much more optimistic perspective.
“Everything is fine with North Korea,” the president said.
We have come close to armed conflict.
“Millions of people would have been killed.
We now have a great relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have resulted in positive results: the end of missile tests, the release of hostages and the remains of U.S. military personnel returned to their families.
He also justified his unusual approach to relations with Kim.
“It’s so easy to play the role of president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this full-blown arena, there are just over 200 standing in front of me,” he said, pointing his finger at the crowd.
Tsunami: Devastated island, hundreds dead in Indonesia
After the earthquake that shook Lombok, help from foreign NGOs was supposedly not needed.
More than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok was dispersed, but no state of national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for triggering international aid.
“Unfortunately, many times they have made it clear that they do not want international assistance, which makes things a little more complicated,” Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is setting up a team to get to Palu, she still doesn’t know if fieldwork will be allowed.
National Disaster Management Agency spokesman Sutopo said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to humanitarian aid.
Despite the constant jolts, the country desperately lacks the means to protect itself from the whims of nature.
Shelters have been set up in Aceh, but they are rare in other coastal areas.
Although a warning was communicated, no alarm sirens sounded in Palu, which may have contributed to the loss of life.
Even in ideal conditions, moving from one Indonesian island to another is not easy.
Natural disasters further complicate the use of transport.
A hospital ship that had been posted to Lombok to treat the victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least 3 days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has placed the reform of the dilapidated infrastructure at the center of his election campaign and has spent considerable sums to rehabilitate roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has undermined Joko's government, which is expected to stand in front of voters next year.
The Indonesian head of state is also under pressure from the persistence of inter-ethnic tensions in the country, where members of the Islamic majority practice their faith in a more conservative manner.
More than a thousand Indonesians have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been driven from their homes amid street clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch: Liverpool forward Daniel Sturridge manages to equalize against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saves a loss to Liverpool in the Premier League against Chelsea, scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge (London).
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 metres away from Chelsea's goals, and his team was led from 1 to 0.
He shot in the ball on his left, before escaping a shot to the second post.
The balloon flew over the repair surface before heading to the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually reached Kepa Arrizabalaga and ended its course at the bottom of the cage.
“I was just trying to put myself in the ball, but players like Shaq are still shooting as far away as possible, so I tried to save as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw that Kante was approaching to control and without much thought I decided to shoot.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in the half after a goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward hauled a pass towards Mateo Kovacic, before spinning towards the midfield and sprinting to Liverpool side.
Kovacic made a quick back-and-forth in the middle of the field,
Then he made a magnificent deep shot that led Hazard to the surface.
Hazard overtook the defense and finished his race in the net of the second post, with a left foot shot behind Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face the Neapolitans in the group stage of the Champions League, Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Indonesia: Tsunami casualties rise to 832
The disaster management agency said Sunday morning that the earthquake and tsunami record 832 deaths.
Many residents are stuck under the rubble of buildings destroyed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that shook the country Friday and triggered waves 6 meters high, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho news agency spokesman told a news conference.
With more than 380,000 inhabitants, the city of Palu was dotted with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman
A murder investigation was opened after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead (Merseyside) this morning.
At 7:55 a.m., the 44-year-old woman was found on John Street in Grayson Mews, and a 32-year-old man suspected of murder was arrested.
Police are urging neighborhood residents who have seen or heard anything to testify.
Police Captain Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation has just begun, but I would like to ask anyone who was around John Street in Birkenhead who would have seen or heard anything suspicious of contacting us.
I would like to refer to the taxi drivers, who might have picked up something on their dashcam, and ask them to provide us with any information that is crucial to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was found at a Birkenhead property where she resided.
This morning, people claiming to know the woman showed up at the crime scene and asked questions about where she was discovered.
The investigation is ongoing and police said they were informing close relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver has just been denied access to his Grayson Mews apartment, with police not allowing anyone to enter or leave the building.
The news left him speechless.
Residents have just been informed that the building would be inaccessible for several hours.
A police officer said the entire area was considered a crime scene.
A woman in tears appeared on the scene.
He said, “It’s too horrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were stationed inside the cordon, and one outside.
Several officers were monitoring the building on the inside of the cordon.
Anyone with information is asked to send a message to ?MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the organization anonymously at 0800 555 111, indicates the 247 register of September 30.
Parliament: The Cromwell Statue, the last victim of an attempt to rewrite history
Its ban would be the fair return of countless religious and cultural assets of England, committed by its Puritan supporters, such as fanatical Taliban, in the face of acts of destruction.
However, the Cromwell Society deemed Mr. Crick's proposal "unreasonable" and called it a "revisionist attempt".
The president of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, states that, "Given the current debate around the removal of statues, it was obvious that Oliver Cromwell's one erected in front of the Palace of Westminster was not going to be spared.
Cromwell neither ordered nor conducted iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars.
It is likely that he was sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas during the previous century.
The superb representation of Cromwell, sculpted by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies to the consideration we had for him in the 19th century and belongs to the historiography of a personality that many of us still celebrate.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures, I mean of monarchy of course.
Whether this representation is accurate or not is a continuing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that broke out in the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognizable figure who represents one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be highlighted and commemorated.”
China: Pig Kills Farmer
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southeast China.
Identified as Mr. Yuan, the man was found dead, his artery severed and covered in blood near a pig market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in a pig shop on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday, with the aim of selling 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the nearby pig shop was open.
He claims that a huge male pig was inside and that blood was flowing from his mouth.
A forensic report confirms that the animal weighing 250 kg has mutilated the breeder to death.
According to Guiyang Evening News, Mr. Wu, the breeder’s cousin, said that “his legs were ground and covered in blood.”
Security cameras show Mr. Yuan arriving on the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his animals.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The pig that caused Mr. Yuan's death was not owned by the breeder or his cousin.
A market official told Evening News that the animal was locked up to avoid any further incidents and allow police to gather evidence.
Farmer Yuan's family and market leaders are reportedly negotiating compensation.
Although the facts are rare, pig attacks against people have already been reported.
In 2016 at a farm in Massachusetts, a pig attacked a wife and her husband, severely injuring him.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kg pig stuck a Welsh farmer on his tractor before his wife managed to keep him away from it.
In 2012, when an Oregon farmer had just been eaten by his pigs, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that it is not an aggressive animal in principle, but that the taste of blood can cause this type of behavior.
“They’re pretty playful animals.
Very curious kids... they have no intention of hurting.
It is enough to show them the respect due to them,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa are expected to cause heavy rainfall in the southeastern United States.
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it travels over the colder waters of the northeast coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will cause showers in northeastern Mexico and southwestern United States in the coming days.
Winds were blowing at 135 km/h (category 1 hurricane) since 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, while Rosa was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The hurricane is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and circulates to the east, toward the west coast of the United States.As it approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a storm, Hurricane Rosa will cause intense tropical humidity to the north, in the southwest of the United States.
It will rain up to 25 cm in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical humidity combined with the approaching depression will create widespread torrential rains in the Southwest over the coming days.
At the local level, rainfall between 2.5 and 10 cm will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and potential landslides in the desert.
The showers will reach a rate of 5 to 7.5 cm per hour at locations, particularly in southern Nevada and Arizona, due to the intensity of tropical humidity.
It is expected to fall between 5 and 10 cm of rain in parts of the southwest, including much of Arizona.
Widespread tropical rains are likely to cause flash flooding and rapid deterioration of conditions.
It is strongly discouraged to venture into the desert on foot due to the threat of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains could turn canyons into raging rivers and thunderstorms will produce wind gusts and dust swirls in places.
The approaching depression will result in abundant local rainfall in some southern parts of the country, on the California coast.
The rainfall totals can reach more than 1.3 cm, which could cause low debris flows and make the shoe slippery.
It could be the first rains of the dry season in the region.
Dispersed tropical showers will reach Arizona on Sunday at the end of the day and early Monday morning, then intensify later Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will fall across the country on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
Significant temperature variations are expected in October across the United States due to Arctic cooling, but the tropical climate will remain warm.
This sometimes causes a radical change of time over short distances.
The central region of the United States, which will suffer from considerable temperature differences on Sunday, is a perfect example.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, or between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, the difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, a persistent summer heat will try to infiltrate and intensify again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to experience a warm early October, with temperatures hovering around 26 degrees across the southern plains and other northeastern regions.
Mercury could reach 26 degrees in New York on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the seasonal average.
Multi-day forecasts indicate that temperatures are expected to be above average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial attracts more than 20 million viewers
Broadcast on six television channels on Thursday, the sweeping hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused her of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s, were followed by more than 20 million people.
As the political stalemate continues, broadcasters interrupted their usual Friday program to announce a showdown: an agreement devised by Jeff Flake, the Arizona Senator, to allow the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
In front of the Senate Judiciary Commission, Christine Ford said she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh, under the influence of alcohol, had touched her and tried to remove her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate tirade, also claimed to be 100% certain that this had never happened.
According to a Nielsen report, the trial likely reached an audience of more than 20.4 million people.
The company calculated the number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures from other channels, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen is not always able to estimate the number of people watching TV at the office.
For comparison, the trial attracted as many people as a football match or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose hosts largely supported Kavanaugh’s nomination, was the most watched channel on audition day, averaging 5.69 million viewers.
ABC ranked second with an audience of 3.26 million.
CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94 million), MSNBC (2.89 million) and CNN (2.52 million) followed, according to Nielsen.
The interest did not weaken once the audition was completed.
Flake was at the center of the drama that was played on Friday.
After the moderate Republican’s office released a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras unveiled a scene in which the senator is sidelined by protesters as he tried to take the elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
Flake lowered his eyes for several minutes, while CNN broadcast the sequence of the arrest live.
“Don’t look anywhere else, look at me,” one of the women said.
“Do you really think he’s telling the truth?
You hold power when so many women are deprived.”
Before the elevator doors closed, Flake said his office issued a statement and would say more at the committee meeting.
All cable and broadcast networks covered the session live a few hours later, as the Judiciary Committee was preparing to vote on the procedure to advance Kavanaugh's appointment by the entire Senate.
Flake indicated, however, that a week-long investigation should first be conducted by the FBI into the accusations made against the candidate, which was demanded by the minority Democrats.
Flake was partly persuaded by talking to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
He made his decision after talking with Coons and several other senators afterwards.
His choice weighed heavily in the balance, as the Republicans would indeed not have obtained the votes to approve Kavanaugh's appointment without a prior investigation.
President Trump has authorized the FBI to investigate the allegations of sexual assault against Brett Kavanaugh.
Britain: May accuses opponents of Brexit of doing ‘small politics’
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of doing “small politics” at the expense of Britain’s future and national interest.
May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another exchange with the newspaper, which posted a photo of Theresa May on the cover, its former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued his attacks on his so-called Chequers plans, claiming that the proposal for free trade between Britain and the European Union was “fairly ridiculous.”
Wayde Sims: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson, Suspected of Killing LSU Player
Police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting that led to the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, also 20, has been stabbed and is charged with second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Service said.
Authorities released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims had lost his glasses during the altercation.
Found at the scene of the crime, the glasses were carrying Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, a subsidiary of the CBS group.
During his interrogation, Simpson confessed to the police that he was responsible for Wayde’s death.
According to his lawyer, his bail was set at $350,000.
The Baton Rouge parish medical examiner's office released a preliminary report Friday, which determines that the death was caused by an injury from a bullet that crossed the head and lodged in the neck.
The police department recognizes the assistance received by the Louisiana State Fugitive Task Force, the forensic laboratory of the state police, the Southern University police, as well as citizens, in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sporting director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for their “commitment and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was only 20 years old.
1.98 m by 98 kg, the player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at the LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points and made 2.6 rebounds per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, Will Wade, the LSU basketball coach, said the team was “devastated and shocked” after the news of Wayde’s death.
“We fear this kind of event all the time,” Wade lamented.
Mexico: A volcano sprouts from the ashes
From the ash escaping the volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern quarters of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Center for Disaster Reduction recommended Mexicans move away from the volcano, after registering a peak of activity in the crater, with 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The center was monitoring several rumblings and tremors from Popocatepetl.
On social media, images showed thin layers of ash covering car windshields in neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity at the volcano located 72 km from the capital, since an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, nicknamed Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalonia: clashes between police and separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday, six arrests took place in Barcelona after clashes between independence protesters and riot police, as thousands of opponents joined protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that divided Catalonia.
Before being pushed back by riot police, masked separatists threw eggs and colored powder at them, creating dust clouds in the streets, which usually do not deplete tourists.
Screws also erupted later in the day, while police used batons to contain the clashes.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanting “neither forgetting nor forgiving” faced unionist supporters shouting “long life to Spain.”
Fourteen protesters with minor injuries were treated, according to local media.
One year after the October 1 referendum, considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalans in favor of separation, tensions still remain sharp in the independence region.
An overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, despite a low turnout, with opponents of secession largely boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent Catalans from accessing polling stations in the region.
Independence groups had camped out on Friday night to block a rally in support of the national police.
It still took place, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist demonstration, said he no longer had any hope for Catalonia’s independence.
“We witnessed a great moment last year.
My parents were crying with joy at the thought of being able to vote, but now we are in an impasse,” he laments.
Despite their capital, albeit slim, victory in regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many popular leaders being exiled or detained pending trial for organizing the referendum and declaring Catalonia’s independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the police support demonstration on her phone, said politicians were responsible for blocking the situation on both sides.
“The tension is only rising,” he regrets.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison awaiting a judgement since last year, announced his intention to stand for election to the European Parliament next year.
“It is the best way for me to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression unleashed by the Spanish government,” he added.
Arrest in Londonderry: Men hit house by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after repeatedly crashing into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 7:30 p.m. local time.
Police Captain Bob Blemmings said the doors and walls were damaged.
The car was also shot with arrows.
Livingston wins 1-0 game against the Rangers thanks to Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal secures Livingston's victory
Livingston's team surprised the Rangers by imposing a second win in 18 games on Steven Gerrard, the current coach of the Ibrox club.
Menga's goal made all the difference and allowed Gary Holt's team to place in 2nd position in the standings, on par with Hibernian.
Gerrard's men are deprived of a Premiership away win this season, and are due to face the 8-point lead team of the Hearts on Sunday.
But before that, the Rangers will meet the Vienna Rapid at the Europa League on Thursday.
As for the Livingston team, it extends its unconquered career in the division by 6 games, and its main coach Holt, who has replaced Kenny Miller since last month, can boast of not having lost the slightest match yet.
Livingston missed an opportunity against stunned opponents
Holt's team could have taken a long lead before scoring, as their direct approach put the Rangers in trouble.
Scott Robinson tried to break through but was stuck in front of the opponent's goal; followed by a late intervention by Alan Lithgow, on a lead by Craig Halkett.
The Livingston team let the Rangers own the ball, knowing that it could hamper them through hard-working tactics.
This is where the decisive goal came in.
The Rangers conceded a free kick and the Livingston attempted an opening; Declan Gallagher and Robinson allied to grab Menga, who took a touch and scored a midfield goal.
At this point, the Rangers dominated the game but found themselves facing impenetrable defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was rarely worried.
The second half experienced the same pace, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to stop.
Rangers goaltender Allan McGregor stopped a hit from Scott Pittman, while Lithgow managed to foil one of Livingston's plans.
The Livingston keeper repelled all attempts and protected his cage, while two penalties were refused by the referee, one for Halkett's provocation against Glenn Middleton and the other for a mishandling.
The Livingston "phenomenon" - Analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Awesome performance and results for Livingston.
They have all been excellent and continue to exceed expectations on this upward slope.
Their style and team composition have hardly changed since their return to the top, but the credit goes largely to Holt for having motivated a team since his arrival.
It has many great players.
Captain Halkett's defense was grandiose and beautifully organized, and Menga managed to keep Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall afloat throughout the game.
Unfortunately, the Rangers weren't inspired.
Despite a good level achieved with Gerrard, they did not live up to their past talent.
They missed one last chance and only managed to break through the opponent's side once; this is a warning for the Rangers, who end up in the middle of the table.
President Erdogan's mixed welcome in Cologne
On Saturday 29 September, Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin in a relaxed atmosphere.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aimed to improve relations between NATO allies.
Several issues were addressed, such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then flew to Cologne for the inauguration of one of the largest mosques.
One of the largest Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
Invoking security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 protesters from gathering in front of the building, while many supporters were able to approach to spot their president.
Hundreds of mostly Kurdish anti-Erdogan protesters have made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him to his country.
The cleavage that emerges from the protests reflects this double vision of Erdogan: a visitor greeted as a hero by some Germans of Turkish origin and described as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: A cyclist dies after a collision with a car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred around 10:15 a.m. local time, near the junction between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road from Deptford to the southeast of the city.
The driver of the vehicle stopped, rescue arrived at the scene, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The accident occurred several months after the death of a cyclist on Chiders Street, about 1.5 km from Saturday's accident.
London police said officers were doing everything they could to identify the individual and warn relatives.
Roads have been closed and bus detours have been put in place. Motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: 6 Officers Injured in Riot
The head of the high-security men's prison said six prison officers had been injured in a riot.
The riot started in HMP Long Lartin Prison, located in Worcestershire, around 9:30 a.m. local time this Sunday, and it's still not under control.
Specialized riot officers were sent to unblock the situation, involving 8 detainees and contained in a prison wing.
On the spot, officers were treated for light facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prison’s management said: “Specially trained personnel have been deployed to restore order in HMP Long Lartin Prison.
Six officers were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible will have to answer to the police authorities and will be able to see their sentences extended.”
More than 500 prisoners, including criminals considered the most dangerous in the country, are incarcerated in HM Long Lartin Prison.
In June, the prison director was hospitalized following an assault by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot police were sent to the prison to stop a serious disturbance: prisoners had attacked the staff with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City threatened by sudden floods (which could benefit drought-affected areas)
It is rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but this is likely to happen early next week. Hurricane Rosa is heading toward the southwestern desert with what energy is left. This region could be hit by sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, with heavy rains starting Monday night.
The Phoenix-based National Weather Service said in a tweet that “only ten tropical cyclones have preserved the stage of depression or tropical storm within a 300 km perimeter around Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) had stopped 64 km from the Arizona border.
The latest estimates from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 cm of precipitation, and up to 15 cm at locations in the Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, are expected to experience 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with total isolated measurements of up to 10 cm.
Rosa’s rainfall could be life-saving for drought-affected areas that are not exposed to the risk of flooding.
Even if the risk of flooding is not to be taken lightly, rainfall could be beneficial for the southwest region, given the current drought situation.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring System, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least one extreme-grade drought, the second most severe category,” reports weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa begins its journey on the coasts of the Lower California Peninsula.
Still very powerful Sunday morning and generating winds of up to 135 km/h, Rosa was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moves north at the speed of 20 km/h.
The storm meets the cold waters of the Pacific and thus loses its strength.
It is expected to reach the Mexican coast with the force of a hurricane Monday afternoon or Monday evening.
In some parts of Mexico, rainfall could be massive and lead to a risk of flooding.
“In total, between 7.5 and 15 cm of rainfall is expected from Lower California in northwestern Sonora and can reach up to 25 cm,” weather.com said.
Rosa will then cross Mexico northward, with the force of a tropical storm, and reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, crossing Arizona and southern Utah in the evening of Tuesday.
“Torrential rains are expected in Lower California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert and are the main danger,” the National Hurricane Center said.
It is estimated that these precipitations will result in potentially deadly floods and debris flows in arid areas, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on charges of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace neighborhood of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at around 4 a.m. local time.
He was sent to the hospital. His condition is currently stable.
Avon and Sommerset police said they arrested the four young men (aged 17, 18 and 20) overnight on the side of Radstock.
The officers made a call to people who may have filmed the scene with their phone.
Trump Says Kavanaugh Was Victim of Democrats’ Anger
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the merciless and outrageous methods of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump claimed that Kavanaugh had been the victim of badness and anger from Democrats throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh spoke Thursday before Congress, energetically and emotionally rejecting the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford, who accuses her of sexually assaulting her decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
The president said Saturday that “the American people have witnessed Kavanaugh’s intelligence and courage” today.
“A vote in the direction of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in the direction of one of the most accomplished lawyers, with a brilliant career in public service,” he told the crowd of supporters gathered in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when he talked about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not a candidate, but I’m more involved than ever,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting on all fronts for great candidates.”
Trump said Democrats were on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
The first decisive Senate process vote for Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to a statement from a Republican party aide to CNN.
Indonesia: Earthquake and tsunami kill hundreds, record continues to grow
On Saturday, authorities said at least 384 people had died, most of them carried away by huge waves that hit the beaches while an earthquake, followed by a tsunami, struck the Indonesian island of Celebes.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in Palu, when six-metre-high waves overwhelmed the beach at nightfall, taking many lives and destroying everything in their path.
The earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.5, preceded the tsunami.
“When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, everyone was still on the beach, and people did not immediately flee, which cost them their lives,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), told a news conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t happen alone, it drove cars, pieces of wood, homes, it took everything with it,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved in the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people have been able to save their lives by climbing trees, he adds.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial images released by the disaster management agency show buildings and shops destroyed, bridges warped and collapsed, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
The earthquakes were felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday’s earthquake was 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city’s geographical location, which borders a long narrow bay, could have amplified the size of the tsunami, she said.
According to Nugroho, the damage is considerable; thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
Bodies were found stuck under the rubble of ruined buildings, he added, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said human and material losses could be greater on the 300-km coastline north of Palu, a region called Donggala, the closest to the earthquake's epicentre.
Communications were “completely paralyzed” from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“The situation is dramatic and may well get worse,” she added.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for failing to release information that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived by the time the alert was released.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man upstairs of a building frantically screaming to passersby on the street as a tsunami approaches.
A few minutes later, a wall of water collapsed on the coast, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the images.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a general power outage that cut all communications in Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army has begun delivering aid by cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, but those evacuated still need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has reopened as part of rescue operations, but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was due to visit the Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
Indonesia: the death toll from the tsunami is increasing, there are more than 800 deaths.
It's a tragedy.
Donggala’s World Vision staff arrived safely in Palu, where they found refuge in tarpaulin shelters in the backyard of their offices, and on the way, they discovered scenes of devastation, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw many houses destroyed,” he said.
It's a tragedy.
When relief groups began to provide relief to the victims, some complained that highly experienced foreign aid workers had not been allowed to travel to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, foreign funds, supplies and personnel can enter the territory only if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that is not the case yet.
“This disaster is still considered regional,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government declares that this is a national disaster, international assistance will be able to intervene, but we are still waiting.”
When the second night after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday fell on Palu, the relatives of the missing people still hoped for a miracle.
On Saturday, a young boy was found in the sewers.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman buried under the rubble for two days, near her mother’s body.
Indonesian national paragliding team coach Gendon Subandono had prepared two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which took place a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Other students were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, Mandagi said.
“As an elder in the paragliding discipline, I’ve experienced my own dramas,” he explains.
In the hours following the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the paragliding community, Mr. Gendon said he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to athletes in Palu who were attending the festival on the beach.
His messages remained unanswered.
“I don’t think they’ve ever received my messages.”
In Newport on the Levee, thieves steal $26,750 when recharging a vending machine
On Friday morning, thieves extorted $26,750 from a Brink’s agent charging a vending machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Service.
The driver of the vehicle was emptying a distributor in the entertainment complex and preparing to power it, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in the statement.
While he was busy, a man appeared behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money for the vending machine.
Witnesses reportedly saw many suspects leaving the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities is requested to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name and becomes Ye
Rapper Kanye West is now called Ye.
To announce the news on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “Formerly known as Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West, who has been calling himself Ye for some time, used the nickname as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The rapper made this change just before heading to Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
Her participation replaces that of Ariana Grande, who canceled her appearance for "emotional reasons," the show's creator explained.
In addition to being the abbreviation of its current professional pseudonym, this nickname also has a religious meaning for West.
“I think ‘Ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you,’” West explained earlier this year, referring to the title of his album with his host Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m us.
I went from Kanye, which means “the only one,” to Ye – the reflection of good, evil, confusion, everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are.”
West is not the only rapper known to change his name.
Sean Combs called himself Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has collaborated with West in the past, has also played on the tie and capital letters.
In Mexico, AMLO says it will never use military force against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians, nearly fifty years after law enforcement bloody reprisals against students.
Lopez Obrador vowed on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square to “never use military force to repress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, the troops opened fire during a pacifist demonstration, killing 300 people as student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador is committed to supporting Mexican youth by providing monthly student grants and opening more free public universities.
Unemployment and a lack of educational opportunities are pushing young people to join criminal gangs.
US should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its funding for research in this sector, according to AI investor and expert Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements come after several U.S. government actors made AI-related announcements, while an official AI strategy is lacking in the U.S.
In parallel, China unveiled its roadmap last year: it plans to become the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling funding for AI research would be a good start, as all other countries are one step ahead of the United States, and we’re looking for the next big breakthrough in AI,” Lee says.
Doubting funds could double the chances that the next key step in the field of AI will come from the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the top-ranked American Othello player, then joined Microsoft Research's management team and became president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee has previously participated in technology competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would take place, in order to identify the visionaries.
According to Lee, American researchers often have to work hard to get funding from the government.
“It’s not China that takes over the academic leaders, it’s the companies,” Lee says.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited big names from universities to work on AI.
Lee added that changes to immigration policies could also support U.S. AI efforts.
“I think green cards should be automatically given to AI researchers,” he says.
China’s State Affairs Council unveiled its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to members of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is expected to involve industry and academia partners, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF is currently investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
At the same time, U.S. legislation to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not taken any action for several months.
Macedonians participate in referendum on the name of their country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia made their voice heard in a referendum on the change of their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, whose one of the provinces is called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor represents a right on its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would affect the ethical identity of Macedonia's majority Slav population.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign had raised doubts about obtaining a minimum 50% participation required to validate the referendum.
The question of the referendum was: “Are you for NATO and EU membership under the terms of the agreement signed with Greece?”
According to supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, this is the price to pay to join organisations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, which has survived the collapse of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of my country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the aegis of the European Union, which means a safer life for each of us,” Olivera Georgijevska, 79, said in Skopje.
While the vote is not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will follow the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Electoral Commission announced that no irregularities had been detected at 1 p.m.
But the turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% at the same time in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 that had mobilized 66% of registered voters after the vote.
“I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko participated in the referendum and voted for the name change, in order to open the voice to a NATO and European Union membership, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, is preparing a small stage and has seats in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
“We want to enter the EU and NATO, but we want to enter through the big door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in Eurasian integration.”
According to Prime Minister Zaev, membership of NATO will allow Macedonia to benefit from the necessary investments. The unemployment rate in the country exceeds 20%.
"I think a large majority will be in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO," Zaev said after filing his ballot.
He added that a “yes” would be a “confirmation of our future.”
According to a poll released Monday by Macedonia’s Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43% of voters would intend to participate in the referendum, which is below the expected turnout rate.
Another poll, conducted by the Macedonian channel Telma, estimated the turnout at 57%.
70% of those intending to vote said they would vote "yes."
In order for the referendum to be valid, 50% of the vote is required plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first blow to the pro-western government’s policy since it took power last May.
Decisive action: Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero makes his way through the defence of Brighton to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton’s defenders in Manchester and won the match 2-0 Saturday at Manchester’s Etihad Stadium.
Aguero’s goal, in the 65th minute, seemed to be the simplest action in the world for the player.
The Argentinean scorer received the ball in the middle of the field, at the start of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defenders, before diving into the field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He bypassed one defender before ousting the others close to Brighton's goal.
Then he passed the ball to Sterling, on his left.
The English frontman took the opportunity to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to trick Brighton goaltender Mathew Ryan with a shot from the right side of the net.
“Aguero has some problems with his feet,” Pep Guardiola, the team’s coach, told reporters.
“We said he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored at that point.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Skyblues the initial lead in the Premier League game,
from the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball directly on the Brighton field.
He sent it to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane made a few touches before taking Sterling to the second post.
The Skyblues front sent the ball into the nets just before sliding off the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer Wants to Play the Rockies' Troubleshooting
With the Nationals out of the play-offs, there was no reason to start a new game.
But highly competitive Scherzer hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only in the event of a playoff game for the Rockies, true legends against the Los Angeles Dodgers of the Western Division of the National League.
The Rockies won 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to secure their first division title.
“While this game isn’t at stake, we want to step on the ground in Denver, with that atmosphere, with the crowd, and with a team that will probably play at the highest level I’ll have to face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate?”
The Nationals have yet to announce a launcher leaving for Sunday, but would be inclined to give way to Scherzer, in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th start, will be in training on Thursday and will launch on his usual rest day, Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is at 18-7 with a deserved points average of 2.53 and 300 withdrawals on takes in 220 steps and two-thirds this season.
Trump's interventions in West Virginia
The president alluded to the situation his support for Brett Kavanaugh has generated for the Supreme Court by talking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“All our actions will have an impact in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
It’s a major issue. I’m not a candidate, but I’m more involved than ever. That’s why I’m fighting on all fronts for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this horrible, really horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it at work.
And they are determined to take back power by all means. See their wickedness.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they crush to take power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, and we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
“You can see that over the last four days,” he added, before calling Democrats “angry, mean and lying.”
He referred to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee and Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which earned him public scolding.
“Do you remember his answer?”
Did you divulge the document?
Ha ha, of course.
No, no. I'm expecting one. It was very bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer the great community it once was.
He is not tolerant of those who express their ideas.
When activists from my local party’s Momentum movement voted to censor me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last of a line of Labour MPs who are considered unwelcome, all for expressing our ideas.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated the same because she stood up against anti-Semitism.
As far as I was concerned, I was censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, these are issues for which Jeremy himself disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification for the Nottingham East Labour rally on Friday read: “We want the rally to be inclusive and productive.”
This is exactly what the Friday evening general meetings were during my eight years as a Labour Party parliamentarian.
Unfortunately, today this is not the case with many rallies and the promise of softer and more respectful policies has long been forgotten, if ever taken into consideration.
It has become obvious that contrary opinions are no longer tolerated within the party. Each opinion is judged on the basis of its acceptability by the party leaders.
It began shortly after Jeremy took power, and colleagues with whom I thought I shared the same political vision began to expect me to turn my jacket around and take positions contrary to my beliefs, whether that be about national security or the EU internal market.
Every time I spoke publicly, and no matter what I said, there was an abusive tirade on social media, calling for withdrawal, denouncing the politics of the center, telling me I shouldn’t be a member of the party.
And it's not just my experience.
Moreover, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments that were made to me were political in nature.
I am in admiration of the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who face a flood of sexist or racist remarks every day, but who do not give up.
One of the most disappointing things about current policy is the standardization of different forms of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer this great community and that the party is restrained by motions of distrust and changes to the rules of selection.
I’ve been given a lot of advice over the last couple of years: look down, don’t express my ideas so strongly, and everything would be fine.
But that is not how I do politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy because the neglect of Thatcher's government had caused my classroom to collapse, and since then I've wanted to work for better utilities for those who need them most, whether as a local councilor or government minister.
I never hid my political ambitions, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be disturbed by my political positions and my disagreements with current party officials.
All I would like to say to those who defended the motion on Friday is that the country is moving towards a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and utilities. I think this is not really the time to waste time and energy debating my loyalty to the party leader.
My only message is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or opportunism will prevent me from acting for the causes I stand for, which are your interests at all.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for the riding of Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr remains undefeated
Two late attempts may have foiled the final result, but no doubt about it: Ayr deserved this triumph following the intense match day of the Scottish Rugby Championship in XV.
The team is now at the top of the rankings and becomes the only unbeaten team in the championship.
In the end, it is the superiority of their defense and the way they are seized the opportunities that allowed them to open the score.
“So far we have been tested, but we remain undefeated, so I have to feel happy!” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose congratulated Ayr: “Bravo to them, they were more effective than us and were able to seize the opportunities.”
Grant Anderson's 14th minute rehearsal, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in a good position, but a yellow card for Scottish squadron Rory Hughes, released for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to make the numbers speak.
Climo aggravated the situation for Ayr with a penalty, before, just in the half time. He scored and turned a solo test to raise the score to 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's rehearsal, transformed by Baggot, narrowed the gap to five points.
A long wait followed due to a serious injury from Ruaridh Knott, who left the field on a stretcher. During the recovery, Ayr resumed with an essay by Stafford McDowall transformed by Climo.
Blair Macpherson, Ayr's acting captain, then received a yellow card and, again, Melrose tried his luck with an untransformed essay by Bruce Colvine, which created palpable tension.
But the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for scoring Climo while he didn't have the ball, from the penalty key, MacPherson touched the back of Ayr's maul, which was progressing.
Climo transformed the trial, as almost every time since the reprise, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent wingman Gregor Henry away for the team's fifth home run.
Still Game star launches into restoration
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, decided to make a career in catering. The actor was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC show, which he writes and co-animates with his longtime partner on stage, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the end of the show, and Kiernan seems to be preparing for the post-Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, though a source at the Scottish Sun revealed that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "blühende restaurant environment."
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, blocked, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol an armoured boat at La Paz Naval Headquarters.
Public buildings carry a blue flag like the ocean.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases display the following motorcycle: “The sea is rightfully ours.
Recovering it is a duty.”
Across blocked Bolivia, the memory of a lost coast to Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still very much present, as is the desire to sail on the Pacific Ocean once again.
These hopes have not been so palpable for several decades, since Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice, which will be rendered on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the will, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course expects a positive result,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on the big screen throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will vote in favor of the Bolivian claim. Bolivia hopes that, after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile will be obliged to negotiate the agreement of a sovereign ocean crossing to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia (who is facing a controversial fight for re-election next year), also has a lot to say about the decision that will be made Monday.
“We are so close to being able to return to the Pacific Ocean,” he said in late August.
But some analysts believe that there is little chance that the court will rule in favor of Chile, and that little would change, even in the event of a positive decision.
The Netherlands-based UN body does not have the power to grant Chilean territory, and stipulated that it would not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice made its decision six months after the last arguments shows that the case “was not complicated,” says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And far from favoring the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may have even harmed it.
“The problem of access to the sea has been diverted by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
Morales’s warlike rhetoric undermined all the remaining Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to exchange, but after that it will be very difficult to hold talks.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court’s decision-making was abnormally fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also disputed the fact that Morales – who remains to this day one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the maritime problem as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The court’s decision is an opportunity to see that we need to get rid of the past.”
North Korea Says Nuclear Disarmament Will Only Happen When It Can Trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s foreign minister, said his country would not get rid of its nuclear weapons until it trusted Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honour the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
He spoke at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears on the verge of relaunching a nuclear diplomacy in the deadlock more than three months after Singapore's summit with North Korea's current leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it’s “chimeral” to think that maintaining sanctions and opposing a declaration that will end the Korean War will bend the North.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration in the absence of any significant disarmament measures from Pyongyang.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But Pyongyang’s seriousness about giving up an arsenal that the country considers the only guarantee of its security is debatable.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Parisian fashion shows unveil the latest trends in headdresses, perhaps soon available in your stores
If you want to add XXL pieces to your hat collection or protect yourself from the 100% sun, look no further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented their collections of delirious oversize hats during a PE19 fashion show that honored the style of Paris Fashion Week.
Hats all more extravagant than each other invaded Instagram this summer, and the creators decided to integrate their delirious pieces into the parades.
Valentino's flagship piece was a beige eccentric hat adorned with a wide edge evoking a feather, which swallowed the heads of the models.
Other oversize accessories included watermelons adorned with jewelry, a sorcerer’s hat and even a pineapple, but these pieces weren’t designed to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of original masks. Just in time for Halloween.
Most masks had stitched lips and evoked Hannibal Lecter more than the Haute-Couture.
One creation looked like diving gear, with snorkels and glasses, while another made you think of a molten ice cone.
And if you follow fashion trends, then you are in luck.
According to style observers, the imposing hats could come to your shopping streets.
The XXL hats follow in the wake of the "Bombe", the wide-edge straw hat that stars tear off, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that markets this hard-to-wear hat that has flooded social media has presented another of its flagship creations on the podium: a straw beach bag almost as big as the swimsuit dummy that wore it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, adorned with raffia fringes and a handful of white leather, was the centerpiece of the PE19 fashion show La Riviera de Jacquemus at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see the big hats and beach bags coming to the stores next summer. The designer has so marked the minds that it’s obvious there will be demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential to the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence. This trend continued in 2018 with excellent new exam results reinforced by collective and individual success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the highest level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for higher education, the career they have chosen and in their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector able to design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that contemporary languages remain popular and desired subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
If you speak to him in his language, you speak to his heart.”
This reminds us that we cannot rely on English to build relationships and build trust with people in other countries.
If we look at the excellent exam results this year, we find that languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages scored the highest, A.
The data, collected from the 74 SCIS member schools, show that 72% of students scored the highest, A, in Mandarin, as did the 72% of students who studied German, the 69% of students who studied French and the 63% of students who studied Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as absolutely essential skills for children and youth in the future.
Languages as subjects are now organized as are science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the programs of independent schools and other schools.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission found that among the difficulties employers face in recruiting candidates, 17% are linked to insufficient language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly vital in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in our globalized world.
Regardless of your career choice, a person who speaks a second language will benefit from a real advantage in the future thanks to this long-lasting skill.
Being able to communicate directly with strangers will automatically place the multilingual person in front of their competitors.
According to a YouGov survey conducted in 2013 of 4,000 adults in the UK, 75% of them did not speak a foreign language sufficiently to hold a conversation. French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage (15%).
This is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
By speaking several languages, especially those in emerging economies, children will have better chances of finding a rewarding job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Many of them will focus on contemporary classical languages, while others will teach languages considered important to the UK in the run-up to 2020, including Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s preferences, several languages will be accessible in independent schools, with specialized staff in the field.
Scottish independent schools want to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
It is clear that at present, in a global business environment, languages remain of paramount importance for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be considered “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
It has to be done.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to make Lakers debut Saturday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who are waiting for LeBron James’ debut at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, the coach of the Lakers, announced that James would play Sunday, in the pre-season opening, against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
We still don’t know how many minutes he will play.
“More than one, less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would likely play for a limited few minutes.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the pre-season program, which includes six games.
“At this point in my career, I don’t need pre-season games to be ready.”
Trump campaign in West Virginia (YouTube channel)
President Donald Trump is starting a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Other stopovers, including in states like Tennessee and Mississippi where the president is popular, are planned.
With the Supreme Court vacancy confirmation vote being postponed, Trump seeks to rally support for the upcoming midterm elections and prevent Republicans from losing control of Congress in the November vote.
What time is the Trump meeting in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch it online?
Trump’s meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. (Eastern time) tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow it online below, live on YouTube.
Trump is expected to address the issue of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh’s sexual assault hearings this week, and Kavanaugh’s Senate confirmation vote is expected to be postponed for up to a week during the FBI investigation.
But this series of meetings is aimed primarily at helping Republicans gain ground ahead of the November election.
According to Reuters, the US president said in his campaign that the five meetings were aimed at “encouraging volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Congressional control is such an essential part of his program that the president will travel to as many states as possible at the start of the hectic election campaign,” a Trump spokesman told Reuters, who declined to be named.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, tonight’s meeting, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could bring together supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media.”
On Saturday, it will be Trump’s second visit in a month to West Virginia, a state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come in and try to get him back into the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team is ready to fight to keep hopeful ahead of Sunday’s singles
After three singles, Saturday afternoon’s foursomes may well represent what was missing from this Ryder Cup.
The momentum swing movement is an invented sporting concept that players sincerely believe in, and more than ever in tournaments like this one.
Where would they put the momentum now?
“They were driving six points ahead and now four, so that gives us a bit of wings,” Spieth said as he set off for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with four points ahead and twelve more to play.
Americans, according to Spieth, feel like they have a bit of wind on their feet and have every reason to be encouraged, including by Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and can boast of having each scored three points out of four.
Spieth proved terribly effective from tee to green and set the example.
The energetic shouts of joy intensified as his game progressed. A crucial putt allowed him to equalize in the fourth half as Thomas and he were led two downs after two holes.
His putt, thanks to which they won the match in the 15th hole, aroused a similar cry, from those who tell you that he believes the American team still in competition.
“You really have to stay determined and focus on your game,” Spieth said.
That’s all that’s left for each of these players now.
18 holes to stand out.
The only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
The strange but adorable European pair has won four out of four matches and is not entitled to error.
Not only were “Moliwood” the only ones not to make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped there Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and during the last nine holes on Friday morning.
This series, the way their energy seems to flow between them and the raving crowd designate them as the players to beat on Sunday, and there is no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to delight in a potential European victory as the sun sets on the National Golf.
Preferably, both at the same time with different holes.
But talking about European glory is premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, while teaming up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine shots sent the Spaniard and Swede into a hole from which they could never get out.
On Sunday, no one is there to help you.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give and those they don’t give, and how a strategy can swing in the blink of an eye.
Europe has played better as a team so far and made a considerable headway over the last day, but this foursome session has also proven that Americans have the courage to fight, which some doubted, especially in the country.
Europe leads 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enjoy a solid lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after winning it 10-6 over the United States in Saturday’s fourballs and foursomes.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a Tiger Woods in distress, allowing them to score four points so far.
Determined to retain the title she lost at Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn’s European team made the difference by winning 3-1 in the morning fourballs against a disorderly American team.
The United States showed greater resistance in the heats and won two victories, but failed to bridge the gap.
Jim Furyk's men must score eight out of 12 points on Sunday in the singles to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while Molinari and he, dubbed “Molliwood” after a smashing weekend, are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in their first four games.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed during the fourballs, they flattened the pair consisting of American rookie Bryson Dechambeau and an already tired Woods by an even more categorical 5 and 4.
Woods, who lagged during both games on Saturday, shone a few times, but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, well rested for the morning fourballs, teamed up with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, winning 2-to-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively number one and three in the world rankings.
Europe was not spared during the tournament that took place in the southwest of Paris, under cool but clear weather.
Triple winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans by scoring two points on Saturday.
They won a well-deserved 2-1 win against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and again beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes, these having lost the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history, a team recovered from a four-point gap in singles, although Furyk's team, who held the crown, now only had to make a draw to keep their trophy.
After being second for two days, however, they might not recover from a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea declares that disarmament cannot be done unilaterally without confidence.
On Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations that maintaining the sanctions reinforced his mistrust of the United States and that it would be impossible for his country to unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
At the UN General Assembly last year, Ri Yong Ho said North Korea had taken “significant goodwill measures” such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and its commitment not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will fear for our national security and, under such circumstances, it is excluded that we will be the first to unilaterally disarm.”
While reiterating North Korea’s well-known reproach for Washington’s opposition to a “step-by-step” approach to denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded if it progressively took action, its statement proved significant in that it did not reject the idea of unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang had done.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, made on June 12 in Singapore at the very first summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader, when Kim pledged to work towards a “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” while Trump promised to ensure North Korea’s security.
North Korea seeks to officially end the Korean War (1950-1953), but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also refused requests to ease tough international sanctions against North Korea.
The United States insists that North Korea first proceed to denuclearization and intensifies the pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve their objective in a coercive manner, even opposing the “declaration of the end of war”.
“Those who think these sanctions can get us stuck don’t know us.
The problem is that maintaining sanctions increases our mistrust.”
Ri made no comment on the second summit between Kim and Trump highlighted before the United Nations by the US leader earlier this week.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the party concerned with the issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a stalemate.”
Still, the tone of Ri’s speech was radically different from last year’s when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable to point North Korean missiles at North American territory after “evil” President Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea last year at the United Nations, did not laud this year the courage with which Kim applied disarmament measures, but added that much remains to be done and sanctions will not be lifted until North Korea disarms.
On Wednesday, Trump said no deadline had been set. “It can take two years, three years or five months; it doesn’t matter,” he said.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the application of Security Council sanctions must be firmly and systematically maintained until complete, definitive and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to suffocate the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then announced he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was somewhat disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang saying progress had been made but, within hours, North Korea denounced his “gangster methods.”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took “equivalent action.”
According to the South Korean president, Kim calls for the security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore, and efforts to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard: Students take rest classes
This year, Harvard University has set up a new course that allows all undergraduate students to sleep more and fights the growing sexist trend of studying caffeine all night long.
A professor has noticed that most students at the best university in the world do not know how to take care of themselves
This course, designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the first of its kind in the United States.
It was after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning that the idea came to him
At the end, a student approached me and said, "Why am I only being told this in the last year?"
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
First delivered this year, this course explains to students the need to adopt good sleep habits to improve their academic and physical performance, as well as their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and general manager of the university’s health services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students were suffering from severe lack of sleep during the week.
The class consists of different interactive exercises.
One of the sections presents the image of a dormitory containing different objects (coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, books...) on which students click to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on their physical performance and the importance of integrating a routine before bedtime.
In another section, participants learn how lack of long-term sleep can increase the risks of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons then invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
“We know it won’t instantly change the behavior of students.
However, in our view, they have a right to know this information – in the same way that you have a right to know what the health effects of smoking are,” added Professor Czeisler.
According to him, the culture of pride of “spending a white night” still exists, and he adds that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure exerted on students make lack of sleep a growing problem.
Having enough good quality sleep should be the students’ “secret weapon” to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even to avoid gaining weight, as lack of sleep puts the brain into starvation mode, making them hungry permanently.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student in chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design this course after being one of his students last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He claimed that this course opened his eyes and urged him to insist that it be offered to the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to offer all postgraduate students a similar program of study before joining the reputable institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students provide an alarm for both bedtime and wake-up time, and be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can disrupt their circadian rhythm and lead to sleep disturbances.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal drops Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another hard blow on the outside, with Dolly Menga's attack leading Steven Gerrard's disjointed team at Livingston to a 1-0 defeat.
Ibrox's team hoped to record their first win on the move since winning 4-1 in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted their second loss in 18 games as coach, leaving their team adrift, eight points behind the Hearts, leading the Ladbroke Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before the half time and the short-inspired Rangers team failed to equalize.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rises to third, just behind Hibernian on the goal difference.
And other difficulties could be felt for the Rangers, as referee Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury following an object being thrown from the opposite side.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team, which swept Ayr in the Betfred Cup semifinal.
Holt, meanwhile, picked the same Livi 11 who tore a point from the Hearts last week and would have been delighted to see his well-trained team choke his opponents every lap.
The Rangers may have mastered possession of the ball, but Livingston did more.
They should have scored at two minutes, when Menga's first shot sent Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then fired a powerful shot at Captain Craig Halkett, but his defending teammate Alan Lithgow was only able to reach the second post
The Rangers managed to take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have had a penalty after the free kick when Steven Lawless and he collided but referee Steven Thomson ruled out the Colombian.
The Rangers took only two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goaltender Liam Kelly was barely disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly and a strike by Ovie Ejaria.
If Livi's opening score in the 34th minute was against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed in the face of Jacobs' stopped kick.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher handed over the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool to choose Menga for an end all in simplicity.
Gerrard reacted halftime by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and the exchange almost had an immediate impact when the wingman showed up in front of Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed to block it.
Livingston continued to push visitors to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping long balls over long balls.
Holt's team could have taken the lead in the final moments, but McGregor did well to push Jacobs back before Lithgow missed the goal.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton once again claimed a penalty at the end of the game while battling Jacobs, but Thomson ignored him again.
Almanach: The Inventor of the Geiger Meter
And now a page from our Almanac "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THE TOURNING ACCOUNT... was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity; an invention that subsequently gave rise to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A pillar of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become fundamental in pop culture, as can be seen in the 1950 film “Bells of Coronado,” with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two unlikely scientists:
A man: “What is this?”
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, we use it to look for radioactive minerals, like uranium.
With these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms released into the minerals by radioactivity.”
Evans: “Say, it’s definitely going to jump!”
“Hans” Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains.
New Cancer Vaccine Allows Immune System to ‘Detect’ Cancer Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Allows Immune System to “Detect” Cancer Cells and Kill Them
As part of the treatment, the vaccine tells the immune system how to recognize cancer cells
This technique involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory.
They can then “detect” a protein that is common to many cancers, and are then re-injected.
An experimental vaccine shows encouraging results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, whose goal is to teach the immune system to recognize cancer cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory, so that they can detect the HER2 protein, common to many cancers, and finally reinject them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the American National Cancer Institute based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
According to Professor Berzofsky, the HER2 protein "causes an increase in several types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, pulmonary and colorectal cancer.
A similar approach, taking immune cells to “teach” them to target cancer cells, has proven itself in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Wearing a MAGA cap, Kanye West embarked on a Pro-Trump diatribe after his move to SNL.
It didn't go well
Kanye West made a comeback after a wild performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump at a Saturday Night Live and announced he would run for office in 2020.
After his third track, Ghost Town, which he sang wearing a Make America Great Again cap, West hit the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“Many times I talk to white people and they say, ‘How can you love Trump?
“Well, if racism worried me, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The show began with a sketch by Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of the West diatribe was relayed on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
We don’t know if Rock was going to make fun of West with this post.
In addition, West had complained to the public that he had spent a bad quarter of an hour behind the scenes because of his cap.
“They put pressure on me.
They told me not to come with that cap on my head.
They put pressure on me!
And then they say I'm in a gulf," he says, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see him, the chasm?" and said he would wear his superman cloak, because no one can dictate his actions to him.
Try love.”
His comments drew him to tears at least twice from the public and the members of the SNL seemed embarrassed, Variety reports. A person on the scene told the magazine: “A death silence fell on the entire set.”
West had been called to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West messed up a lot of people by singing the song I Love it in a Perrier bottle suit.
West received the support of the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who posted the following tweet: "To one of the bravest minds: THANK YOU TO HAVE BEEN THOSE IN THE FULL."
But Karen Hunter, the show’s host, tweeted that West was simply “loyal to himself, and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“However, I choose not to reward anyone (by buying his music, his clothes or supporting his art) who, in my opinion, adopts and pours out an ideology that is detrimental to my community.
He's free.
And so do we,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and claimed that he was now "officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper Snoop Dogg was named after Snoop Lion and of course the legendary fire Prince, who changed his name to symbol, then that of the artist formerly known as Prince.
Belfast Charged with Attempted Murder After White Gun Assault at Restaurant
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed last Friday at a restaurant in east Belfast.
According to police, the incident occurred in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast court of first instance on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecution.
Kit Harington, the star of the Game of Thrones series, tackles toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as a fine blade, Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, HBO's violent medieval fantasy series.
But the 31-year-old actor took to the macho hero stereotype, saying that this type of role on screen often leads young boys to pose as hard to cook to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believes “something is wrong” and addresses the issue of toxic masculinity at the time of MeToo.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, a 31-year-old coveteen with Game of Thrones, said he “strongly” wants to tackle the issue.
“Personally, I deeply believe that we have abused masculinity.”
“What lessons have we taught young men who become adults, compared to the problem that is now posed?”
According to Kit, television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity because of its very masculine characters.
He continued: “What behavior is innate, what behavior has been inculcated?
What do television and the street teach young boys to think they have to behave like that to be a man?
I think that’s really one of the fundamental questions of our time – how can we change that?
There’s obviously something wrong.”
In the interview, he also confessed that he would not do prologues or sequels when the series ends next summer, claiming to have finished with “the battlefields and the horses.”
Starting in November, Kit will star in a cover of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a movie producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that ever happened to him in Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this show, so she offered me my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the lover of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, on the family estate of Leslie.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14 per cent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
According to Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are affected.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most patients have been contaminated during sex, which is a new fact.
Historically, the virus has spread rapidly to some parts of the country as a result of transfusions of contaminated blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been virtually reduced to zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference held in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
In the Chinese LGBT community, HIV transmission through sex is a serious problem.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains widespread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70% to 90% of gay men end up marrying a woman.
Many cases of transmission are due to inadequate sexual protection.
As part of its efforts to combat this problem, the Chinese government has been promising universal access to HIV medicines since 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that a GOP employee disclosed data about senators, and denounces "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
On Saturday, U.S. Republican Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her team posted personal information about three Republican senators on the lawmakers’ Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the statements were supported by “far-right” experts and websites.
“Lies, lies, and infamous lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
It appears that the leaked information included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information was posted Thursday by an unknown man at Capitol Hill during the Senate sitting on allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came some time after all three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the messages was associated with the Waters office and disclosed the information of a Waters staffer.
According to Waters, “this unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie.”
“The member of my team, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised due to these fraudulent and false allegations, is in no way responsible for the leaking of this information.”
“This false allegation is completely false and a real lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly drew criticism online, including from Ari Fleischer, the former White House press secretary.
“This denial is anger,” he wrote.
“This indicates that she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he hasn’t done, he shouldn’t be angry.
It must not be provocative.
It must not call into question the motives of the accuser.
She must remain calm and serene.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for Waters in the midterm elections, also shared his thoughts on Twitter.
“If that’s true, it’s huge,” he wrote on Twitter.
In its statement, Waters said its office had alerted “law enforcement authorities and services concerned” about these fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the culprits are exposed,” she added, “and that they are held accountable for all their destructive and dangerous acts for all members of my team.”
Johnny English hit again. Parody of Rowan Atkinson, sub-talented spy
It has now become a tradition to search for the scope of Brexit in any new British film and this seems to apply to this remake of the action comedy Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and resurfaced in 2011 with Johnny English, the comeback.
Will the ironic self-satisfaction on the question of the obviousness of our insignificance represent the new export opportunity of our country?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his cheesy eyes and rubber face, has seen his license renewed for the second time in a confusing context - this name indicates above all that it is a great comic creation designed for a non-English-speaking film audience.
Of course, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his dubious attempts at glamorous charmer, possesses a bit of Clouseau, a hint of Mr. Bean, and a good dose of the guy who performs a small note in The Chariots of Fire during the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
Originally, he also draws inspiration from the traveler and international mystery man Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving chaos behind him.
The last Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I loved Johnny English approaching a helicopter as he wore a medieval armor and the rotor blades hit his helmet briefly.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is highlighted, although humor is rather insufficient and strangely superfluous, especially at a time when "serious" licenses like 007 and Mission Impossible compose themselves with confidence with comedy.
Humor seems more child-oriented than adult, and for me, Johnny English’s goofy misadventures are less creative and less targeted than Atkinson’s silent film gags in Bean’s character.
The perpetually current premise is that Britain has serious problems.
A hacker has infiltrated the super-secret web network of British spies, unveiling the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the dismay of the operatives on duty – an alas small-scale role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the drop that overflows the vase for a prime minister who is a pompous character on the brink of crisis and already suffers from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this quasi-Teresa-May character, but there's not much to put under the tooth in the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that every active spy has been compromised, she will have to get someone out of retirement.
This means disturbing Johnny English himself, who is now employed in a chic institution as a schoolteacher, but who secretly teaches how to become a secret agent: some nice pranks here, because English offers a spy academy like Rock Academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and finds Bough, his former long-term partner, again camped out by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, attached to a submarine commander, a fun hockey stick role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who create big trouble for Her Majesty's Secret Service, go back to action and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the grip of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough launch their odyssey of jokes: under the guise of waiters, they set fire to a brilliant French restaurant; they create chaos by sneaking onto Volta's luxurious sailboat; and English triggers a real anarchy when he tries, with a virtual reality helmet, to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All the stops are insured for this last sequence, but despite everything, there is a lot for the children in all this.
A rather moderate film.
I couldn’t help but think, as with the other Johnny English films: Can’t the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that will really value his talent?
Labour Party denies plan to allow British workers to work four days but pay for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party must examine a radical plan that will allow Britons to work four days a week – but get paid for five.
Apparently, the party wants business leaders to make workers benefit from the savings generated by artificial intelligence (AI) by giving them an extra day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend while continuing to earn the same salary.
According to some sources, the idea would be in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to steer the country in favour of workers.
The move to a four-day week has been approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of economic changes.
A senior Labour source told the Sunday Times: “It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.”
“It won’t be in one night, but a four-day work week is a goal that goes hand in hand with the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the workers as well as with its overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party was committed to a four-day work week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is currently not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: “A four-day work week is not a party policy and is not envisaged by the party.”
Deputy Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week's Labour conference to give details about his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell has expressed his determination to take back power in the hands of "anonymous directors" and "profiteers" in public utilities.
The alternate chancellor's plans also provide that current shareholders of the water companies may not recover their entire stake as the Labour government could make "deductions" due to alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed his plan to integrate workers into the boards of directors of companies and the creation of an inclusive shareholder fund that will pay 10% of the capital of private companies to employees, who will pocket up to $500 in dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy confide in “60 Minutes” if the FBI’s investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The final vote on Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court appointment was postponed by at least a week following the FBI’s investigation into the charges against him and raises the question of whether the Bureau’s findings could prompt Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast Sunday, Scott Pelley, the correspondent for the “60 Minutes” program, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover anything that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
"As I went to the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when these allegations were made, and I asked him, "Did you do this?"
He was determined, determined, unequivocal.”
However, Graham’s vote seems to be engraved in stone.
“I made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it would require an explosive charge,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett flatly denied it,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And the people she named couldn’t verify it.
It's a 36-year-old case.
I don’t see anything new that changes.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a very impressive star record and an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh edition, will see tens of thousands of people rush to the Great Lawn of Central Park to not only enjoy the performance of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of the festival, namely to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which first took place in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you’re willing to pay for a VIP ticket), viewers had to perform a series of tasks, or “actions,” such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, calling, or making any other useful effort to raise awareness of poverty.
But to what extent can Global Citizen still achieve its goal in the remaining 12 years?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really persuade them to demand a call to action, or is it just another example of “clichtivism” – a situation where people really think they’re making a difference by signing a petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, who advocate for many different goals.
According to the organization, these actions have helped incite world leaders to make commitments and adopt policies amounting to more than $37 billion that are expected to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements arising from its shares, of which a tranche of at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or withdrawn.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the key commitments is The Power of Nutrition, a UK partnership of investors and executives committed to “helping children reach their full potential,” while pledging 35 million pounds to help Rwanda end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 messages from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” Tracey Ullman, an ambassador for The Power of Nutrition program, told the crowd at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that following the undertaking of more than 5,000 actions aimed at asking the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children through nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, “What makes you think it’s possible to end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen said: “The road to it will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and we will fail.
However, like the major civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will perform this year in New York, where Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host the show.
US could call on Navy to create ‘blockade’ to curb Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
In order to prevent Russian energy from entering markets, including in the Middle East, Washington can “if necessary” call on the US Navy, US Home Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed.
Zinke said Russia’s presence in Syria – including where it operates at the request of the legitimate government – is a pretext for Russia to explore new energy markets.
“I believe they are in the Middle East for the purpose of negotiating energy as they are in Eastern Europe, the southern center of Europe,” he said.
According to the official representative, there are ways to remedy this.
“The United States can, with our Navy, ensure that shipping lanes are open and, if necessary, obstruct to ensure that their energy is not put on the market,” he added.
Zinke was speaking to participants at the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that defines itself as the “speaker of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are actually identical.
“As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic option lies more or less in the exploitation and replacement of fuels,” he said, while referring to Russia as having “more than one rope to its bow” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come as the Trump administration has pledged to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper solution for European consumers.
To do this, representatives of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to get out of the “inappropriate” project of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, makes the city of Berlin “captive” of Moscow.
On several occasions, Moscow has pointed out that the US$11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double its current capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin says Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
In a September speech in Moscow following a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said, “I believe we share this view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers.”
The U.S. position has sparked negative reactions from Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in this project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to get involved in European energy policy or bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a huge problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, the director of the German Federation of Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider running for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would seriously consider running for president following the midterm elections.
At a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and for that, a woman will have to be at the top,” she says, according to The Hill.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president.”
Warren said what she thought of President Donald Trump at the public rally, saying he was “leading this country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m very worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was frank in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
However, a poll published Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters do not think she should run in 2020.
According to the University of Suffolk and Boston Globe Center for Political Research poll, 58% of “probable” Massachusetts voters said the senator should not come forward.
32% were in favour of such a campaign.
The poll found that former Governor Deval Patrick was more supportive, with 38% in favor of a potential campaign and 48% against it.
Other prominent Democratic names mentioned for a potential 2020 campaign include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin PTSD during Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is feeling right now, what he feels on his way home, I can connect with other families who are feeling the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers are returning with,” she told the public at the rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a “taboo subject” and said about his son and other veterans that “they come back a little different, hardened, wondering if we respect what their comrades and air force members, and every other military, have given to the country.”
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Service, he was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence on a woman, interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a drunken gun.
18 states and the District of Columbia support judicial challenge of new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia are in favor of a judicial challenge to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing a gang or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, representatives of the 18 states and the district filed a memo in favor of an asylum seeker who challenged this policy, NBC News said.
The plaintiff's full name in the Grace v. Sessions case opened in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner “and her sons, members of violent gangs,” had assaulted her, but U.S. authorities decided to reject her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
State prosecutors who support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications in the United States, as countries facing widespread problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, the District Attorney General of Columbia, said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law stipulates that all applications for asylum must be considered on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a ban violates this principle,” the amicus curiae said in its memo.
Lawyers have also argued in the memo that the policy of denying immigrants entry harms the U.S. economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary work.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylee is granted to people who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear for reasons of race, belief, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political convictions," Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of the policy.
“Asylee was never designed to mitigate all the problems – even the most serious – that people encounter every day around the world.”
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the death toll doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is becoming more and more dramatic.
“I feel very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, comforting her feverish little boy in Palu, in an empty city evacuation center.
“At every moment, an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is rare.”
Residents were seen going to their destroyed homes, picking up soggy goods, and trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who was suffering from a back and shoulder fracture, rested in front of Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to heavy, persistent aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he told how he felt the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was crushed in the ruins of the wall, I believe,” Haris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife crying for help, but after the silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of “Intimidation” Through “Propaganda Ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page advertisement praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade in a U.S. newspaper, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the China Daily supplement in the Des Moines Register – Iowa’s best-selling newspaper – after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. parliamentary election on Nov. 6, a charge that China refutes.
By accusing Beijing of wanting to meddle in the U.S. election, Trump marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in a growing campaign led by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralyzed in a growing trade war that has led them to impose reciprocal tariffs on their imports.
At the start of the trade war, China’s tariff measures were aimed at hitting exporters from states like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “is doubling its intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by inserting paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad writes.
“On the other hand, at the Beijing press office you will find few protesting voices and you will not see the true reflection of the diverging views that the Chinese can have on China’s disturbing economic trajectory, because the media is firmly obedient to the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most important newspapers has avoided publishing” his article, without saying which newspaper.
Analysts warn Republicans are alienating female voters as midterm elections approach because of Kavanaugh’s debacle
While many high-ranking Republicans defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh against a background of allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that a negative reaction, particularly among women, could occur during the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiments surrounding this case have been extremely strong, and most Republicans have already shown publicly that they want the vote to take place.
In an article published September 29 in The Hill, Grant Reeher, a political science professor at the University of Syracuse’s Maxwell School, said “we can’t go back.”
Reeher added that he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.)’s last-minute efforts in favor of an FBI investigation would calm voters’ anger.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and national spokesperson of the progressive group MoveOn, “women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November,” she said on September 28, according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, Mic reports, protesters chanted “November is coming!” in the Senate corridor as Republicans running the Judiciary Committee chose to advance Kavanaugh’s appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to be disproportionate,” said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But that could be even higher, especially among suburban voters and young voters between the ages of 18 and 29 who, even if they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public deposition explaining in detail the allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts have suggested the reaction could be lively if Republicans moved forward with confirmation.
According to NBC News, former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said earlier this week that “It has become a confusing mess for the GOP.”
“It’s not just the committee vote or the final vote, it’s not just the nomination of Kavanaugh, it’s also about how Republicans handled the situation and how they handled it,” Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that helps elected Democrats, told the newspaper.
Following the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, however, Americans seem divided about the credibility of the two sides, with a small majority leaning towards the latter.
A new YouGov poll found that 41% of those surveyed absolutely or probably believed Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they absolutely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they believed Kavanaugh probably or absolutely lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, after pressure from Senator Flake.
Ford testified under oath last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she had been assaulted by Kavanaugh when he was intoxicated at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that when they were studying at Yale in the 1980s, the Supreme Court candidate would have shown him his genitals during a party.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a brand new company looking to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that leverages Berners-Lee’s free platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is saved as well as the persons authorized to access such or such information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt was aimed at “dominating the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the launch.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “online personal data store” or DPL.
It can contain contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time on a single browser.
The particularity of the online personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access what type of information.
The company calls this “personal responsibility through data.”
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, Inrupt’s idea is that the company brings the right resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few developers working on contract on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to build their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not yet in discussion with “Facebook and Google” about whether or not to make a complete change where all their business models are completely changed in an instant.
“We don’t ask their permission.”
In an article on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that [Inrupt’s] mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem in order to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Although he launched Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of a World War I cleric decorated with the Victoria Cross
The only Church of England cleric to have received the Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann won this distinction on September 29, 1918, during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and was unaware that he had obtained the highest British military distinction.
Her two grandsons unveiled a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, said it was “brilliantly symbolic” to unveil the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s feat.
According to the London Gazatte, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion on the St. Quentin Canal “through a very thick fog and under the violent firing of field guns and machine guns.”
Later he rushed to the firing line and, with the "greatest bravery", led the line before blowing up a field cannon on his own and knocking down three soldiers from the detachment.
On October 4, 1918, a German sniper killed Lieutenant-Colonel Vann, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I’ll never be up to, but that makes me humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also filed a crown after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Vann said he felt "very honored to be part of the parade" and added that "the courage of an authentic hero is reflected in the support that will be given to him by many people."
Mixed martial arts fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206. Instead, they had Peppa Pig
Imagine that, you spent all night watching a full Bellator 206, but you couldn’t see the main event.
In San José, the event featured 13 fights, including six on the main record, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to face off, viewers in the UK were shocked when the broadcast changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unhappy that they stayed awake until the early hours of the morning, especially for the fight.
A Twitter supporter described the move to children’s cartoons as “a kind of bad joke.”
Regarding the transmission, Bellator’s Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications, Dave Schwartz, said that “the government regulation states that at 6 a.m. this content was not adapted, so they had to switch to children’s programming.”
“Peppa the pig, yes.”
Scott Coker, the president of Bellator, said they would work on their programming to include British viewers in the future.
“I think when I think about rebroadcasting, I think we can probably find a solution,” Coker said.
“However, it is six o’clock in the morning on a Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution until Sunday our time, which is Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program flipped, there were a lot of messages in both directions and they weren’t all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn’t a problem, it was a government issue.
I can guarantee it won't happen next time.
We’ll limit ourselves to five fights instead of six – as we usually do – and we’ve tried to give more for the fans and we’ve ruined everything.
This is a regrettable situation.”
Previous articleDesert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt ‘inferior’ to sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality – but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he went to high school that “not everyone [was] like me.”
As part of Lauren Laverne’s first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs show, he said he talked about the issue of gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that becoming a parent had made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The show’s regular presenter, Kirsty Young, took several months off because of her illness.
Appearing as a shipwreck on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less than" any other children growing up because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said, “Even today, these feelings of being inferior and different are the real things that have given me the power and strength to succeed.”
In order not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned the truth about his sexuality, he wanted to prove that he was “something,” he continued.
The double Olympic bronze medallist is now a renowned LGBT activist and took advantage of his participation this year at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was speaking out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and wanted to restore “hope” to others.
The triple world champion claimed he “didn’t expect” to fall in love with a man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, met in 2013
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you see so much at such a young age" - he attended his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find a person of the same age who had experienced the same ups and downs.
In June, they became parents to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that "his whole perspective" had changed.
“If you asked me last year, I was only thinking about winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know what, there are things that are more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
Her son is named after her father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked him was if they already had their tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to be seated in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you’re not going to be in the front row anymore,’” he said.
“I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and it took him to stop breathing and die to finally recognize that he was not invincible,” he added.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“It was all I’d dreamed of all my life – diving in front of a crowd at home at the Olympics, there’s nothing better,” he said.
In addition, it inspired him his first song choice - Proud by Heather Small - which had accompanied him in preparation for the Olympics and always gave him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15, BST.
Mickelson out of shape on Ryder Cup bench on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record this Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to rectify to avoid it being an unfortunate step.
Mickelson, who was competing in the biannual competition for the twelfth time, a record, was ruled out by Captain Jim Furyk of Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as he has so often been for the United States, the five-time great champion has divided his day between supporting and fine-tuning his game at the stand in order to remedy his ills.
He has never been the greatest leader, even at the height of his career.At 48, he is not the most suitable for the difficult Golf National, where the long rough systematically punishes missed shots.
And as if the course wasn’t formidable enough in itself, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, faces off against British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who teamed up this week with Tommy Fleetwood to win their four games.
If the Americans, with four downs at the start of the 12 singles games, get a good start, Mickelson’s game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man, but he couldn’t say much else.
“He fully understood the role he had to play today, slapped me in the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in him.
He’s a legendary champion and he’s added so much to these teams in the past, just like this week.
I probably didn’t see him play two games.
I was expecting more, but that's how it happened and that's how we felt we had to proceed.
He wants to be there, like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo’s record for the most Ryder Cup games ever.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite reached the heights of its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven losses, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has brought concrete elements to the team.
He’s funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to make fun of people, and he’s a great guy to have in the team room.”
“I think younger players had fun playing against him this week, which was fun to see.
He does more than just play.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows the lead may soon be gone
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a not insignificant advance before the simples of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult course.
The Dane played his first game in 1997 at Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros was five points ahead of the Americans, but eventually rose to the top of the standings with the smallest possible gap on the finish line, winning 141-2-131-2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we were driving a lot at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we failed, as well as at Valderrama, where we won, but rightly so,” said Bjorn, after watching the 2018 Rank win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday at the Golf National to lead 10-6.
History will prove to me and to all the members of this team that this is not the end.
Go ahead and get it done tomorrow.
Go ahead and do whatever it takes.
It's not over until you get the points on the board.
We have a goal, to try to win this trophy, and that’s what we need to stay focused on.
I’ve always said I’m focused on the 12 players on our side, but we’re very aware of what’s happening on the other side – they’re the best players in the world.”
Delighted by the performance of his players on a tough golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never advance on this point.
Tomorrow is another pair of sleeves.
Tomorrow, the individual performances will be presented and it is quite different.
It’s fantastic to be with a teammate when things are going well, but when you’re out there solo, you’re put to the test up to your full capacity as a golfer.
That’s the message for players to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
When you leave your partner behind, he has to get the best out of himself, too.”
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will seek to ensure that his players get better results individually than as teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced both ends of these last-day reversals, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before losing at the end of the “Médinah Miracle”, where Europe wrestled the win.
“I remember every word,” he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, rallied his players on the last day.
“We have 12 important meetings tomorrow, but you would like to take this quick start as you saw it in Brookline, as you saw it in Medinah.
This dynamic, when it goes one way, puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We set up our training accordingly and put the guys as we thought we had to do, we’re trying to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas has been assigned the task of leading the counterattack and will face Rory McIlroy in the first-class duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the top half of the standings.
“I accompanied this group of guys in that order because I think it covers the whole course,” Bjorn said of his selections in simple.
Germany's new warship still postponed
According to local media, the new German Navy frigate should have been put into service in 2014 to replace the aging warships dating from the Cold War, but it will not be in service until at least next year due to faulty systems and exponential spending.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, which cites a military spokesman, the commissioning of the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the flagship of the new frigates of Baden-Württemberg, has been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but worrying post-delivery issues have undermined the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships the Navy commissioned in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is certain that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technologies, such as a radar signature, infrared and reduced acoustics.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years outside of home ports.
According to Die Zeit, however, the relentless delays mean that war-avant-garde ships – which should allow Germany to project its force overseas – will already be obsolete when they are put into service.
Last year, the cursed F125 frigate made headlines when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
The reasons for this return were little known, but the German media mentioned a number of “software and hardware flaws” that rendered the warship useless in case of deployment on a combat mission.
Software flaws were particularly significant as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, which is half of the crews of the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it appears that the ship is significantly overloaded, which decreases its performance and reduces the ability of the Navy to make future improvements.
The 7,000-ton “Rheinland-Pfalz” is estimated to weigh twice as much as similar-class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Beyond the failures of the computer system, the price of the project as a whole - including the training of the crew - also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached the astronomical sum of 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars), compared to 2.2 billion initially.
The problems associated with the new frigates are of particular importance in light of the recent warnings that Germany's naval strength is declining.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defence committee, acknowledged earlier this year that the navy is in fact “short of ships capable of deploying.”
The official said the situation had produced a snowball effect over time, as the old ships were downgraded but no replacement ships were designated.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust monitors the secret life of bats
New research in an area of the Scottish Highlands seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape in their quest for food.
It is hoped that the observations will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and guide future conservation activities.
The study by researchers from the National Trust for Scotland will follow common bats and sopranos as well as long-eared brown bats and Daubenton at the Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using handheld detectors.
A professional sound analysis will determine the frequency of the bats’ screams as well as the activities of the different species.
A habitat map and report will be prepared to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour across the territory.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for the NTS, hopes the results will reveal the most important areas of habitat for bats and how they are used by each of these species.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work such as grassland creation and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, bat populations have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects the perch and results in the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fly-killing papers and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, given their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to spot insects and obstacles on their flight route.
Responsible for protecting more than 270 historic buildings, 38 large gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, the NTS takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, perch inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organization has also established Scotland's first and only bat reserve at the Threave site in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, Domain Manager, says the site is the ideal territory for them.
“Here at Threave, we have an ideal spot for bats,” he says.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the right habitat.
But there is still a lot to learn about bats, so the work we do here and in other places will help us better understand what bats need to thrive.”
He stresses the importance of checking the presence of bats before proceeding with the maintenance of properties, because by unintentionally destroying a single maternity nest, it can cause the death of 400 females and small, or even the disappearance of an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, disturb them, or destroy their perch.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and as far as many of our species are concerned, we don’t know what’s going on in their populations right now.”
Ronaldo Refutes Rape Charges as Lawyers Prepare to Sue German Magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape charges against him “false information,” and claimed that people “want to make themselves known” using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus attacker was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He then reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep her quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Speaking to his 142 million fans in a video posted live on Instagram, just hours after the allegations aired, Ronaldo, 33, called the information “false information.”
“No, no, no, no, and no.
What they said today is false information,” the five-time Ballon d’Or winner told the camera.
“They want to advertise using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have described as “inadmissible denunciation of suspicions in the field of privacy.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek redress for “moral damages of an amount commensurate with the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious human rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms hotel-casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga apparently returned to the player's room, where an anal rape allegedly occurred, according to documents filed with the Clark County courthouse in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo got on his knees after the alleged incident and assured him that he was a “99% good guy” but that he didn’t know what was going on with the remaining “1%”.
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but that they had consented to it.
Mayorga also said she went to the police and that photos of her injuries had been taken in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an amicable settlement because she felt “terrified by retaliation” and feared “public humiliation.”
This 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to cancel this settlement, as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid by leaving Manchester United at the time of this alleged assault, and this summer he joined Italian giant Juve under a contract of 100 million euros.
Brexit: The UK “would regret forever” the departure of automakers.
According to Greg Clark, the secretary of state in charge of trade, the UK would “forever regret it” if it lost its status as a world leader in automotive construction after Brexit.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK told the BBC it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant near Derby if Britain withdrew from the EU without a deal.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant – which makes Toyota’s Auris and Avensis vehicles – built nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90 percent of which were exported to other European Union countries.
“I consider that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s director in Burnaston.
Other British carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears of leaving the EU without a deal on how cross-border trade works.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month following Brexit.
The biggest concerns are what automakers call risks to the supply chain in the event of no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is operated in “tense flow”, parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for custom-made vehicles.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be disruptions at the border that the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep the inventory for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and so production would be stopped.
According to Clark, Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks.”
“We need a deal, we want to have the best deal that will, as I said, not only take advantage of the current success, but also seize this opportunity,” he said on BBC Radio 4’s Today.
“The evidence, not just from Toyota but from other manufacturers, is that we absolutely need to be able to maintain what has proven to be an excellent supply chain set.”
While Toyota was unable to specify how long production would be halted, it cautioned that in the longer term, additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, the Unite union coordinator at the plant and who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years, said its members were increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once these jobs disappear, they never come back.”
A government spokesman said: “We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU.”
White House says Trump and Rosenstein meeting could still be delayed
According to the White House’s announcement on Sunday, the key meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed by a week,” as the fight for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, the special adviser charged with investigating Russian interference in the elections, ties between Trump collaborators and Russia, and possible obstacles to justice exercised by the president.
The question of whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and thus jeopardize Mueller’s independence, has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had talked about wearing a microphone in order to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of eliminating the president by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
However, on Monday, he showed up at the White House, as he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into complaints against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
On Sunday, Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, made an appearance on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “No date has been set for this, it could be this week, I could see if we can postpone another week given all the other things that are happening in the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see and I like to keep the press up to date.”
The claim would be contested by some journalists: Since September 10, Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the rarity of the conferences was not due to an aversion to “demagogic” TV reporters, although she said: “I have nothing against the fact that they amaze the gallery.”
Then she hinted that the direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
Without citing any evidence, she added that “the president attends more question-and-answer sessions than any other president before him”: “We checked the numbers.”
There will always be press conferences, Sanders said, but “if the press has the chance to directly question the president of the United States, it’s infinitely better than talking to me.
We’re trying to do it frequently, you’ve seen it well in recent weeks, and it’s going to take the place of a press conference where you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends public sessions or press conferences with dignitaries.
It is rare that there are solo press conferences.
This week, in New York, the president may have shown why, by making a casual and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of the assembled journalists.
On Brexit fears, Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU officials working within the Scottish NHS to express the country’s gratitude and wish them to remain in office after Brexit.
Scottish parliamentarian Jeane Freeman sent a letter within less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to covering the cost of status applications for European citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “During the summer, negotiations on the withdrawal continued between the UK and the EU and are expected to result in decisions this fall.
But the British government has also stepped up its preparations in the event of a no-deal.
I understand that this period must be very disturbing for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that consolidate and improve the work of health services, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
After Suffering Head Injury, Christion Abercrombie Underwent Emergency Surgery
Sselon Mike Organ of Tennessee State, Christion Abercrombie, the Tennessee Tigers' second-in-command, was operated on after a head injury on Saturday in the Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27 defeat.
Rod Reed, the head coach of the state of Tennessee, told reporters that the injury had occurred just before halftime.
“He got to the touch line and collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the touch line before placing it on a stretcher and taking it for another exam.
A state representative from Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the Vanderbilt Medical Center operating room.
Harris said there was "not yet any information on the type or extent of the injury" and that the state of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury had occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year athlete, is in his first season with the state of Tennessee after moving from Illinois.
He had five tackles in total on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his season total to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty if they buy a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty if they buy a property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help the homeless under the new conservative regimes.
This measure will nullify the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters
Stamp duty will be taxed on those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty rate if they buy a property in the UK - the extra money will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This measure will be seen as an initiative to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters by committing to providing more affordable housing and targeting high-income earners.
The increase in the stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional money will be used to strengthen the government’s efforts in the fight to help the homeless.
This surtax - in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and rental purchases - could reach 3%.
The Treasury expects the project to raise up to 120 million pounds a year.
Approximately 13% of new construction in London is purchased by non-residents in the UK, which drives up prices and prevents first-time homeowners from gaining a foothold in the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “ghost cities” because of the high number of foreign buyers who stay most of the time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in the stamp duty to help more young people buy a first home.
Accusing major construction companies of keeping real estate prices at a high level by seizing land without using it, he urged Ms. May to give up quotas on affordable housing in order to settle the “real estate disgrace” raging in the UK.
Mr. Corbyn presented an attractive set of reform proposals in the housing sector, including rent control and the elimination of “faultless” evictions.
He also wants to give councils more powers to build new housing.
Ms May said: “Last year, I said that I would dedicate my position as prime minister to the rebirth of the British dream – that every new generation would have a better life.
To do this, we need to repair our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to all those who want to live, work and build a life here.
It is unfair, however, that it is as easy for non-UK residents, as it is for foreign companies, to buy a home as it is for hard-working UK residents.
For far too many people, the dream of accessing property has become distant and the misery of the homeless remains too real.”
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland coach Jack Ross says his “ultimate ambition” is to become the Scottish coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot takes pleasure in the challenge of reviving the Northeastern club, which is currently third in League 1, three points ahead of the leader.
He joined the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was selected for Division B and that’s all,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“But I grew up following Scotland’s Hampden games with my father and it’s something I’ve never forgotten.
This opportunity, however, would only arise if I succeed in the management of the club.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland coaches are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic technician says he has not hesitated to line up behind such iconic names in such a large club, having already declined proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, the success of the moment will be measured in the light of the question, ‘Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
Due to the structure and infrastructure of this club, it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League,” he added.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I would probably consider myself a success here only if I managed to bring the club back there.”
Ross has only three years of coaching career, after a stint as an assistant at Dumbarton and 15 months with Hearts coaches.
He then helped Alloa move up from a relegation to the third division and turned St Mirren, who was on the verge of relegation, into the championship's big winner the following season.
Ross felt more comfortable now than during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Alloa’s care “was probably a real crossroads,” he recalls.
“I really felt that being a coach was better for me than playing.
It seems strange because I did well, I made a good living and I took advantage of some appreciable heights.
But sometimes playing is difficult.
There are a lot of details to settle each week.
I continue to experience this in terms of stress and tension at work, but being a coach is fine with me.
I’ve always wanted to lead and now I do, I feel more comfortable in my skin than I have been in my entire adult life.”

According to a survey, the ideal time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturdays.
The summer heatstroke raised revenues for struggling British pubs, but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures indicate that the bars and pubs groups recorded a 2.7% increase in their sales in July, but revenues in restaurants fell by 4.8.
CGA’s Peter Martin, who compiled the data, said: “England’s permanent sunshine and longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup resulted in July following the pattern of June, where bars had seen a 2.8% increase, except for restaurants, which suffered an even greater shock.
The 1.8% decline in June in the catering sector only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars where alcoholic beverages are served are by far the most popular, with more points of resemblance than restaurants that fall.
Food pubs also suffered from the effects of the sun, but not as much as restaurateurs.
It seems like people just want to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6% over the month and food declined by 3%.”
Paul Newman, RSM Leisure and Hospitality Analyst, said: “These results follow the trend observed since late April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales in the off-home market.
Not surprisingly, catering groups continue to struggle, although a 4.8% decline in annual average sales is particularly painful, in addition to ongoing cost pressures.
The long, hot summer could not have been less opportune for food business operators and the weather will tell us whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will give a well-deserved respite.”
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in the establishment.
Industry sales are monitored by the UK pub, bar and restaurant industry’s Boxer Peach Tracker, which collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with combined revenue of more than 9 billion pounds and is the industry standard.
On social media, one in five children has secret accounts that he hides from his parents
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students found an increase in “fake Insta” pages
The news has heightened concerns about the publication of sexual content
20% of students said they have a “primary” account to show their parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – opens a social media account that he keeps hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found a rapid growth of “fake Insta accounts” – a reference to the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news has heightened concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students reported running a cleaned “main” account to show it to their parents, while having a private account.
A mother who accidentally stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website found a teenager inciting others to “rape me.”
According to the study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of young people aged 11 to 18 have a double profile, with half of the students acknowledging having private accounts.
MSC Chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create places online where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will represent the athletes on the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the governing body’s annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated athlete in athletics and President Ian Beattie has described this choice as a great opportunity for the sport’s leaders to capitalize on his extensive experience gained internationally over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys immense respect within the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are confident that athletics in Scotland would greatly benefit from its participation in the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I really want to be the voice of the athletes and I really want to be able to make my contribution and guide this sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 1996 200-metre and 400-metre Olympics in Atlanta where he won four gold medals and is now a regular commentator for the BBC, was unable to walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
Doctors said only time would tell if or how much I would recover.
It was hard work, but I recovered completely, I learned to walk again and today I do agility exercises!

Online, a breast pump ad that compares mothers and cows divides opinions
An online advertisement from a breastfeeding company compares breastfeeding mothers to cows when milking.
To mark the launch of what is called the “world’s first silent breast pump,” Elvie, a consumer technology company, launched a daring music video-inspired commercial to showcase the freedom her new breast pump offers nursing women.
In a barn filled with hay, four real mothers dance to the rhythm of a song whose lyrics are: “Yes, I’m treating myself, but you don’t see a tail” and “In case you didn’t notice, it’s my breasts, not nipples.”
The chorus continues: “Pump it, pump it, I feed the babies, pump it, pump it, pump it, I help the women milking the milk.”
However, the advertisement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, has sparked an online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the public, many of whom say it sheds light on the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Just like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken away from them within days of their birth,” one of them wrote.

Another commented: “It’s a trauma understandable to the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who care for their baby?”
Someone else added, “An advertisement so disconnected.”
Others defended the advertisement, for example a woman admitting that she found the song "hilarious".
“I think it’s a genius idea.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pomper made me feel like a cow.
The advertising is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It’s a great product,” someone wrote.
Someone else commented, “It’s a fun advertisement for moms who pull their milk (often at work or at the toilet) and feel like ‘cows.’
It’s not an advertisement that praises the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they danced with the discreet breast pumps hidden in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use breast pumps say they feel like they are cows.
However, the Elvie breast pump is completely silent, without wires or pipes and fits discreetly into a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their baby and even get out while pulling their milk.
Ana Balarin, Partner and DPE at Mother commented: “The Elvie breast pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By making a parallel between nursing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on breast milk extraction and all its challenges, while expressing in a fun and reliable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new milk pump will provide.
This isn't the first time Elvie has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the podium of designer Marta Jakubowski while using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children silently set up camp at Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has risen sharply even though the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively stable, partly because the Trump administration’s harsh speeches and policies have made it more difficult for children to be placed with respondents.
Traditionally, most respondents were undocumented immigrants themselves and feared compromising their own ability to stay in the country by going to the rescue of a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential respondents and adult members of their households should submit their fingerprints and that this data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified last week before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested did not have a criminal record.
“Nearly 80% of people who are respondents or their family members are here illegally, and many of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to prosecute these people,” Albence said.
According to shelter stakeholders, in order to deal with children more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the norm before.
Many of them will appear by videoconference, rather than in person, to plead their case regarding their legal status before an immigration judge.
Persons deemed ineligible will be promptly deported.
According to stakeholders and reports submitted by the shelter network in recent months, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to outbreaks of violence or escape attempts.
In a large institution like Tornillo, these concerns are exacerbated by the fact that signs that a child is in difficulty are more likely to be neglected because of its size, according to child rights advocates.
They added that moving children to the camp without giving them time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends could accentuate trauma that many find difficult to manage.
Syria is calling on U.S., French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately.
In an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in that country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would “be treated accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem argued that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, when more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would “continue to wage this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are purged” from both terrorist groups and from any “illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, most of whom train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
In this war-torn country, France has more than 1,000 soldiers there.
Moualem said the conditions were favourable for refugees to return, and accused “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational concerns” that deterred refugees from returning.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to ensure that these returns are facilitated,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have said that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end this war is concluded.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in Idlib’s last rebel fortress has helped advance political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish deal has avoided a large-scale assault on the province where three million people live, by Russian-backed Syrian forces.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement provided for “precise deadlines” and expressed hope that the military measures would target the jihadists, especially the Nusra Front fighters, who are al-Qaeda-linked and who “will be eliminated.”
Staffan de Mistura, a representative of the United Nations, hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee bringing together members of the government and the opposition in order to draft a post-war constitution and pave the way for elections in Syria.
Moualem defined the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, stating that the group’s work should be limited “to the revision of the articles of the current constitution,” and issued a warning against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers hope, impeachment and scandal lead him to leave his presidency prematurely.
What would be "the most spectacular final of a presidency!"
At the moment, the public shows no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak hour ratings have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN, and have nearly tripled, amounting to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s “Rachel Maddow Show,” which reaches 3.5 million viewers at big nights, is the premiere cable TV channel.
“It’s a case that attracts people because it’s not something we understand,” said Neal Baer, host of ABC’s drama series “Designated Survivor,” which talks about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a seasoned comedic author and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And Some Irrefutable Truths About Slipping into the Hollywood Boys’ Club,” has another theory.
She remembers taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked him.
“He said, ‘Because it makes me laugh,’” Mrs. Scovell said.
Chaos has a playful value.
Of course, unlike anything on television, Washington’s scenarios could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade affair, whether immigrant families can come together and the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the wealthiest viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself watching for six hours a panel of experts debate how Bob Woodward used “deep know-how” for his book “Fear,” on Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (“a garment filled with pride,” according to the Washington Post’s “Daniel M.”
I will never see Super Mario the same way again.
“If part of what he’s doing feels like he’s watching a reality show, it’s because he’s making you swallow something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” about Trump’s shifting teams and daily turnarounds (fighting the NFL, congratulating Kim Jong-un).
We can't afford to miss an episode otherwise we're lagging behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees at home on the north shore of Kauai, but he would just sit inside and watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not detach himself, not with Brett Kavanaugh preparing to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
“I remember the time when we were running all these crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Money from outside invades the tightest midterm elections
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania was flooded with money, thanks to a readjustment of the congressional constituencies that allowed two incumbents to compete for the same seat.
This suburban district of Pittsburgh, which has recently been restructured, is the seat of Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another constituency in the special elections last spring.
Lamb measures up to another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, which strongly overlaps the new 17th District.
The maps were redesigned when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former arrondissements were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race of the new 17th district kicked off a confrontation regarding the financing of election campaigns between the major branches of party financing, the Congressional Committee for the Democratic Campaign (CCCD) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (CNCR).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a win narrowly won last March in a very popular special election in the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
That seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Politicians have given Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. considered penalizing El Salvador for its support of China, then backed down.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, to which Washington had little opposition.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the leadership of the Trump Organization.
State Department officials decided to convene heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to protest “their recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” department spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions were only planned against El Salvador, which received US aid estimated at $140 million in 2017, including to control narcotics and provide development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included reductions in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings continued, representatives from North and Central America delayed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting that took place last year, seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from visiting the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, thus ending any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now speaking at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to show the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American emissaries have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new messages or harsh punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton at the White House declined to comment on the details of the debate that were described by the three U.S. dignitaries, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations under the guise of anonymity.
Their comments were corroborated by an independent analyst close to the administration, who also remained anonymous.
Studying history
The next tile could be special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the possible impediment to justice of Mr. Trump.
Mueller would also direct his investigation to the question of a collusion of Trump’s campaign with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If congressional control changes hands, Mr. Trump will find himself held accountable to this body, as he prepares to stand before voters and, perhaps, before a jury made up of his peers.
These are many “ifs,” and I’m not claiming that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable – nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
We all have decisions to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an impact on the potential duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were about to stage a coup against Hitler, if only the West had stood up to him and pushed the Czechoslovaks back to Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these divisions and the inevitable march of democracy is accelerating or is delayed.
Americans are currently facing a number of these cleavages.
What will we do if Mr. Trump sends the deputy back to Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a tricky situation since the paper reported that last year he offered to secretly register the president and made assumptions about his inability to perform his duties.
Rosenstein says the Times report is inaccurate.
“What will we answer if the FBI’s recent investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or impartial – or if he is consigned to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump to account?
If we do not succeed in these trials, democracy will have a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, who once occupied my ambassadorial residence.
She survived, immigrated to America and, sixty years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on the table wearing the swastika.
With this legacy, I can’t help but be optimistic about our future.”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, confident against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory against the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will place them in a solid position to qualify for Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury deprived midfielder Graham Dorrans of his first game of the season until the 2:2 draw against Villarreal, but he is convinced that the Rangers are able to get the most out of such a result to achieve feats.
“It was a positive point for us, because Villarreal is a quality team,” said the 31-year-old striker.
“We went into the game thinking about getting something and we left with a point.
We might have won in the end, but overall, a draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came back in the second half and we were the best team.
Thursday is another important European evening.
With a bit of luck, we can hope to get three points, but it will be a difficult match as they made a good result in their last match, however I am sure we can continue and get a positive result with the crowd behind us.
“Last year was really tough, between my injuries and the changes to the club as such, but there’s a satisfaction factor about this place now.
The team is good and the guys have a lot of fun; the training is quality.
Let’s hope we can move forward now, leave last season behind us and triumph.”
Women no longer sleep because of this fear about their retirement savings
Although participants in this survey clearly knew how they wanted to be looked after, few people discussed the issue with their family members.
Nearly half of the people who participated in the national study said they were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t do what it takes to have this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouses and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care for you if you do not communicate your wishes to them well in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to determine where and how you can receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your financial advisor is also able to help you establish a way to pay these fees.
Your long-term care financing decisions can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with buyback value to help you cover these expenses, or other insurance on your wealth – provided you have the means to insure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles as you go.
Provide a health care proxy that will allow you to appoint a trusted person who will verify your medical care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider a power of attorney regarding your financial resources.
You would choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and pay your bills if you are incapacitated.
Think of the small details: Suppose your elderly parent has a medical emergency and goes to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
List these details in a written document to be well prepared.
“It’s not just the finances that are at stake, but also who are the doctors?” Martin asked.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Put that plan in place.”
A man was injured several times with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man received several bullets fired with a compressed air rifle as he walked home from an evening party.
The victim, in his forties, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, belly and hand.
Police described the incident, which took place at approximately 2.30 a.m. TSB, as a "random act".
The victim did not see his assailant.
His injuries did not threaten his life and the police launched a call for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, and the toll is expected to rise.
Since communications were paralyzed, the rescue services were unable to receive any information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicentre of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of the disaster.
Some essential facts about Palu and Donggala, on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, whose population was estimated at 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that runs more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The Regency, an administrative region below a province, was estimated to have a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, and especially of the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past century, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck west of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Seismic Fire Circle and is regularly shaken by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake, which occurred on December 26 on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, triggered a tsunami that swept across 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of whom were in Aceh.
2005: Several violent earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra from late March to early April.
A few hundred people have died on Nias Island off Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.8 hit southern Java, Indonesia's most populated island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast and claimed nearly 700 lives.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 rocked the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 devastated one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake shook the reign of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding residents of the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was caused this time, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes rocked the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed several thousand buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and a candidate for vice president Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, contravening a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a statement released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he allegedly took the phone of a female acquaintance who was trying to call the police to report alleged crimes.
Palin is being held in pretrial detention at the Mat-Su pretrial detention center and is being held on unsecured bail of $500, KTUU said.
He appeared in court on Saturday, declaring himself “not guilty, that’s for sure” when asked for his advocacy, the network said.
Palin faces three Class A offences, meaning he could be sentenced to up to one year in prison and is liable to a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B minor offence, punishable by a day's imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference with the report of a crime of domestic violence, and possession of a drunken weapon in connection with the incident.
His wife said he had hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent behavior to PTSD stemming from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia: Several Hundred Dead
At least 384 people died as a result of the earthquake that shook Indonesia's Sulawesi island last Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and ravaged thousands of homes.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are down and the death toll is expected to increase in the coming days.
The quake broke out just off central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta.
Videos posted on social media show the point of impact.
Several hundred people had gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu at the time the tsunami broke out on the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Call for Rare Death Penalty for New York Terrorist Suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the alleged New York assailant who has claimed eight lives – a rare penalty that has not been applied in that state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a rented truck from Home Depot to attack a bike path on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, mowing pedestrians and a cyclist on his road last October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will need to provide evidence that Saipov “intentionally” murdered the eight victims and “intentionally” inflicted serious personal injury, according to the statement of intent to seek the death penalty filed with the Southern District of New York.
Both charges are likely to result in the death penalty, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the assault, a federal grand jury sentenced Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for extortion of funds, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and one for crimes of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “careful preparation and premeditation,” prosecutors said, calling Saipov’s method “hateful, cruel and depraved.”
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The Southern District of New York had not claimed the death penalty in prosecution for ten years.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers but was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case was in 1953 in the case involving Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for engaging in acts of conspiracy and espionage for the USSR in the two years following the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, has demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days and months following the tragedy, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators that he was happy with his actions.
Saipov told authorities he had been incited to commit the attack after watching videos of Daesh on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to display the flag of Daesh in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was “obviously disappointed” with the decision to pursue it.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept his plea of guilt and sentence him to life imprisonment without the possibility of release can only prolong the trauma related to these events for all concerned,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had already asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage pledged today to “mobilize the popular army” at a rally at the Conservatives’ conference.
The former UK Independence Party said politicians should “feel pressure” from eurosceptics – as one of Theresa May’s MPs suggested, he should be tasked with negotiating with the EU.
Backban Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham march that Britain “would have already been freed” if Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the dilemma Ms May is facing to reconcile her deeply divided troops has been underlined by conservatives in favor of staying in the Union who joined an isolated anti-Brexit rally in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to maintain his Chequers compromise plan despite threats from those who want to leave and those who want to stay as well as from the EU.
The allies stressed that it would continue its attempts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite hostilities - and would force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its agenda and "chaos".
Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to “get rid of the Chequers.”
He felt that Mr Farage should have become a partner and be entrusted with the task of negotiating with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have been out already,” he said.
The member for Wellingborough added: “I will defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers.”
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he continued: “We did not engage in world wars to submit.
We want to make our own laws in our own homeland.”
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have turned the page and want to stay is completely false.”
Conservative Andrea Jenkyns, a supporter of the exit, was also present at the march to tell reporters: “I’m just saying: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is also the case of our party and our activists who roam the streets and make us elect above all.
Give up the checkers and start listening.”
In a message addressed to Ms. May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage told the rally that politicians should be led to “feeling pressure” if they were about to betray the decision that was taken in the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
They’re trying to cheat Brexit and we’re telling them today, “We’re not going to let you get away with it.”
He added in a message to the enthusiastic crowd: “I want you to make our political class feel the pressure that is about to betray Brexit.
We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that has allowed us to win the Brexit victory and we will not stop until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud UK.”
Meanwhile, pro-European followers marched through Birmingham before organising a two-hour rally in the city center.
A small number of activists have brandished Conservative banners against Brexit after the group’s launch this weekend.
His Labour counterpart Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives because of the security issues surrounding the party's implementation at the start of the conference.
“They are the ones who assure us that they are able to put in place the IT systems and all the technology for Canada, more, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a real farce.
A good Brexit doesn’t exist,” he added.
Warren intends to seriously consider running for president
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed her future at a public assembly in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a voice often critical of President Donald Trump, is running for reelection in November against Geoff Diehl, GOP representative in the states, who was co-chair in 2016 for the Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She found herself at the center of speculation that she could face Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters at a public assembly since Trump took office.
A participant asked her if she intended to run for president.
Warren responded that the time had come “for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, which implies having a woman head of state.”
Previous articleSims Shot Death Arrest at Louisiana State University
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced that a suspect had been arrested in connection with the shooting death of Wayde Sims, an LSU basketball player, on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Service participated in the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m.
On Friday, they released a video of the shooting, asking for help identifying a man who was featured on the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot dead Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
“Wayde Sims received a gunshot wound to the head and succumbed to her injuries,” Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told media Saturday at 247 sports.
Wayde took the defense of his friend and was shot by Simpson.
When asked, Simpson admitted to being on the scene, possessing a gun, and firing at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in police custody in East Baton Rouge Parish.
Sims, a 2m youngster who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games, including 10 starting last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton makes his way to the world title after the team's guidelines allowed him to win against Sebastian Vettel
It quickly became apparent from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton last Saturday that the Mercedes team’s instructions would play an important role in the competition.
From pole position, Bottas took a good start and flew Hamilton on the flank as he defended his place in the first two laps, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the pits first and left Hamilton to jump into the peloton’s tail turmoil, which should have been a decisive element.
The Mercedes passed the pits a lap later and ended up behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after a wheel action that saw the Ferrari driver reluctantly leave the inside at the risk of resisting after a double defense attempt in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the last row of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first round to celebrate his 21st birthday.
He then dominated much of the race while maintaining his tyres to aim for a speed finish and ahead of Kimi Raikkonen in fourth place.
He finally reached the pits in the 44th round, but was unable to accelerate the pace in the remaining eight rounds, with Raikkonen ranking fourth.
It’s a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team did an exceptional job to get a one-two,” Hamilton said.
It was very bad body language.
At a meeting last Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein, who stressed that she had not unveiled the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but argued that the events taking place in the Senate showed that people were “bad, disgusting and dishonest.”
“The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that’s been going on in the Senate these last few days, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and nasty and disgusting and dishonest,” he said.
“Seeing the disclosures and leaks, they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you release any information?
Do you remember his answer... did you release any information - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I have not disclosed anything.”
Well, wait a minute.
Have we divulged information... No, we did not divulge information,” he added, thinking of the senator’s impression.
Feinstein received a letter last July from Ford detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh, and the disclosure took place in early September, but Feinstein denied the leak came from his office.
“I didn’t cover up Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t divulge his story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She told me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked.”
But his denial does not seem to be well received by the president, who commented Saturday night at the rally: “I’ll tell you, it was very bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, accused of sexual assault by three women, the president hinted that Democrats were using these allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
You see the meanness, the pettyness, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control,” the president told Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars erased their Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants on Friday by winning the 5-3 return game in Dundee last Saturday.
The Giants opened the score with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home equality before Dwyer gave the Giants back the lead.
François Bouchard tied for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals, securing them victory.
This was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe players, who beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night after being caught.
This was the fourth confrontation of the season between the two sides, the Giants having triumphed in the last three games.
Dwyer gave the lead in the fourth minute, at 3:35, thanks to a pass from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford served Beauvillier who doubled the bet four minutes later.
During a busy first period, Sullivan relaunched the local team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt put himself in Cownie's service, at 15:16, with an equalization.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the first break when he hit his second goal of the evening towards the end of the first period.
The local team came together and Bouchard equalized once again with a goal giving a numerical advantage to 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, securing victory for his team by scoring a fifth goal midway through.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will host Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller died helping hundreds of people aboard plane escape earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is hailed as a hero after he died while making sure a plane carrying hundreds of people can take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many more are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi last Friday, causing a tsunami.
Heavy aftershocks continue to ravage the area and large numbers of people are trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite the flight of his colleagues, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to give up his post in the violently shaken tower at Palu’s Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport.
He remained on site to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at that time, could take off safely.
He then jumped from the control tower when he felt it collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Siriat, the spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said the move could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We mobilized a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“Our hearts are broken to learn that,” he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, with the country’s disaster prevention agency saying access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The record would continue to grow as many bodies were still under the rubble and many could not be rescued,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves measuring up to six meters have ravaged Palu who will celebrate a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide aid and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute, an ambulance brings bodies back.
Clean water is rare.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they’re going to find.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country’s military: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?” said CNN.
Indonesia was rocked earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says a man has disappeared after a plane crashed in the lagoon.
The airline that handled the flight that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says a man is missing after the 47 passengers and crew safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, she has not been able to trace a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more specific information about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said on Saturday that six passengers were still in hospital, and that they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events remain uncertain.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane had landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Witnesses said the plane had passed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had arrived too low.
“It’s a very good thing,” Jaynes says.
Jaynes said he and the others were able to sneak into the water to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
l claimed that the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and that he was suffering from a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to upgrade a dock had also taken part in the rescue by using a pneumatic boat to transport people to land before the plane sank into about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Air Safety Network data indicates that 111 people have died in airline crashes registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none concerned Air Niugini.
Analyst Presents Timeline of the Night the Woman Was Burnt Alive
The prosecution adjourned his case on Saturday at the trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used phone records from a cell phone to track the movements of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several cell phones that indicated Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, which contradicted his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers while he was pretending to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford appeared at the bar Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford replied that he was “[lying] because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
“He wiped it out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is due to begin its pleadings on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be held before the jury during the course of the day.
The High Breed: What is political hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by imbuing its music with positive messages.
Bristol’s The High Breed claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins from political messages and social problems.
The group wants to reconnect with its roots and make political hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have experienced a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
Nanny in New York sues couple for firing her after 'racist' text
A nanny in New York sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message mistakenly conveyed by the mother who complained that she was “still a Black woman.”
The couple refutes being racist, and equates the lawsuits with “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her dismay when she observed in 2016 that Giselle Maurice, the new nanny, was Black when she arrived for her first day of work.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOON IS NOW BLACK,” Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Mrs. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, after understanding her trouble, Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Ms. Maurice, explaining that their former nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and was expecting a Filipino instead.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a day’s work and then sent home by an Uber.
Now Mauritius is suing the couple for compensation for their removal and is seeking compensation of $350 a day for the six-month home service for which they were initially hired, but without a contract.
“I want to make them understand, listen, we don’t do that kind of thing,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to the allegations of racism by saying it was reasonable to end Maurice’s employment, fearing that they could not trust him after doing him harm.
“My wife sent him something she didn’t want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you entrust your children to someone you were rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Let's see!"
Assimilating the trial to “extortion,” Plasco said his wife was only two months away from having a baby and was in a “very delicate situation.”
“Would you chase someone like that?
It’s not a very nice thing to do,” added the business banker.
While the case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has not hesitated to denounce the couple on social media, blaming them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers fear readers won’t identify with a talking bear, new letter unveils
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it’s published.
It’s a lot of fun, knowing what we know about Paddington’s huge success.”
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the children’s book inspired by a small teddy bear, would have remained optimistic about the rejection of her work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book’s publication had had a “sweet-bitter” flavor after her death last year.
She describes Paddington as a “very important member of our family,” and adds that her father was very proud of her ultimate success.
“He was a pretty calm man, and he wasn’t pretentious,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who does something: we’re proud of him, even if it’s not really his own accomplishment.
I think he saw Paddington’s success that way.
Although it is his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he has always attributed credit to Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried everything to save her life.
"Nad would call regularly to explain how bad the situation was, we didn't expect it to happen," said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then Nad called me to let me know that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
Medications given to her by doctors to maintain her heart rate were slowly running out of her system.
She had died some time before and it all stopped.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that this was all going on.
I couldn’t scream or scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, grieving over her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, not caring about the ordeal she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“My head was down, and I was crying all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this immense sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women in mourning deposit postcards to prevent suicides on bridges.
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted, on a Welsh bridge, postcards containing inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Davis’ son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I’m forced to feel on a daily basis,” she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising leader with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile illuminated any room.”
However, he quit his job before he died, as he was “in a very dark place.”
In 2014, 11-year-old Tyler’s brother found his brother after he committed suicide.
Davis said: "I'm constantly afraid there's a training effect."
Davis created the maps “to let people know that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t keep quiet – you have to talk.”
Ms. Humphreys, a long-time friend of Ms. Davis, lost her 15-year-old partner Mark shortly after her mother’s death.
“He didn’t say he felt down, depressed or whatever,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we saw his attitude change.
He was at his lowest on Christmas Day – when the kids opened their presents, he had no eye contact with them or anything.”
She said her death was a huge trauma for them, but they have to get through it: “It’s heartbreaking for the family.
It destroys us.
But we all have to go forward and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as the FBI begins its investigation.
“I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for – a time-limited investigation, limited in scope – maybe we could bring some unity,” Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would “collapse” into a partisan deadlock.
Why didn’t Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of the moment.
The midterm elections will only take place in five weeks, on November 6. If, as expected, the Republicans score poorly, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and met, through him, his wife Ashley, who was at the time his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
We do not yet know whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to sever the vote and confirm it before the Supreme Court.
North Korea: Number of deserters ‘falling’ under Kim’s leadership
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South’s unification ministry, said 1,127 desertions took place last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said tightening border controls between North Korea and China and increasing tariffs demanded by smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment.
The vast majority of deserters in the North will ultimately be granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ), located between the two Koreas.
China sees deserters as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
North-South relations - which are technically still at war - have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang in talks focused on the denuclearization negotiations that had hitherto remained pending.
This came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, broadly speaking, to work for a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions on the lack of progress since then.
“In the absence of confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances it is excluded that we are the first to operate unilateral disarmament,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," and says he's unfit to sit on the Supreme Court
Pelosi, the parliamentary minority leader, called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said he was unfit to sit on the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had behaved this way, they would have called her “hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and at times almost screamed and choked, referring to his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats sitting on the committee, calling the allegations about him a “grotesque and coordinated assassination” organized by disappointed liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she said Kavanaugh’s testimony showed he was unfit to sit on the Supreme Court, as he showed he was against the Democrats.
“I think he discredits himself with these statements and the way he has dealt with the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not only unfit to sit on the Supreme Court, he’s also unfit to sit on the court he’s currently in,” Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge at the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible rulings against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, since he is considered a conservative judge.
During his confirmation hearings, Mr. Kavanaugh evaded the question of the possible reversal of certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t it wonderful,’” Pelosi said.
And women must use it.
It's a legitimate diatribe, months and years of anger overflowing, and she can't get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s rare, do you?”
“I was greatly helped by a woman who was a manager somewhere, who told me that she was also crying when she got angry, but she developed a technique that allowed her to tell the person she was talking to, when she got angry and cried, ‘You can think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she continued.
And I found it brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger, in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most striking memories of my first job, in a male-dominated office, where I once found myself crying with inexpressible rage, was being grabbed by the skin of my neck by an elderly woman – a cold manager who had always terrified me a little – who dragged me down a staircase.
“Don’t let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’re thrilled because they had you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on her presidential election.
In 1987, while Mr. Hart had been caught in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called Monkey Business and had withdrawn from the campaign, Ms. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me, laughing 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates running, and the last thing they were missing was one more person.
Someone called it “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
As the campaign was very advanced, she had lagged behind in fundraising, and so swore that she would not participate unless she raised $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She learned that some of her supporters who usually gave $1,000 to men only intended to give her $250.
“Do they think I’m entitled to a discount?” she asked.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so upset by her emotions -- the gratitude for the people who had supported her, the frustration with the system that made it so difficult to fund and target voters rather than delegates, and the anger over sexism -- that she felt dizzy about it.
“You would have thought I was having a nervous breakdown,” recalled Ms. Schroeder about the media’s reaction to her.
“You would have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were going to put on my tombstone.
“She was crying?”
How the U.S.-China Trade War Could Benefit Beijing
The first salvos of the U.S.-China trade war have been deafening, and while the battle is far from over, a disagreement between countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest increase came this week with new tariffs affecting items worth US$200 billion, taxing half of all goods from China arriving in the United States.
Each time, Beijing responded in kind, hitting tariffs of 5-10% on $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has pledged to match the United States, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to waver anytime soon.
To back down from Washington is to yield to demands, but to give in publicly to the United States would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts believe, however, that if Beijing can play its role correctly, the pressures of the US trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick policy decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for economic slowdown in either country is actually far more dangerous than what observers have previously acknowledged,” Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia, told the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syria ‘prepared’ for return of refugees, says foreign minister
Syria declares itself ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild this country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary repatriation of refugees to the country they have been forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have deserted the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid for the reconstruction of this devastated country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept any conditional assistance or assistance from the countries sponsoring the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Golf National near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the title when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team crossed the 14.5 point mark to beat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who has been in trouble for most of the tournament, plunged his start into the water in the 16th hole in par-3, ceding his duel to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of four players to have ever reached 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format, whose first edition dates back to 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5-4 by the European team's worst-placed player, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The best golfer in the world, Dustin Johnson, has bowed 2-1 to the Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, the Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the all-time European champion with a total of 25.5 career points.
“In general, I don’t cry, but today it’s stronger than me.
It was a turbulent year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
What matters is the team, and I’m happy to have been able to help him,” Garcia said with emotion after the European victory.
He handed the torch to fellow golfer John Ram, who beat American golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in a single on Sunday.
“I feel incredible pride, having beaten Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods has lost his four games in France and now holds a 13-21-3 career record in the Ryder Cup.
A surprising statistic for one of the greatest golfers of all time, who won 14 major titles, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk commented after a disappointing performance about his team: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we had a certain moment when we put pressure on Europe.
We gave up.
Hut to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We’re going to regroup, I’m going to collaborate with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we’re going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be a captain.
We have to bow.
We were overtaken.”
Red Tide Info Point: Lower concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report by the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission indicates a general decrease in red tide concentrations in some areas of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the CPF, more irregular flowering conditions are reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - causing fears of falling concentrations.
The red tide covers about 209 km (130 miles) of coastline, from northern Pinellas to southern Lee County.
Islanders are found about 16 km (10 miles) off Hillsborough County, but at fewer sites than last week.
The red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations in or off Pinellas County have been reported last week, low to high concentrations off Hillsborough County, higher concentrations in Manatee County, higher concentrations at the bottom of Sarasota County or off, medium concentrations in Charlotte County, and low concentrations in the Collier County.
Cases of respiratory irritation persist in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No respiratory irritation has been reported in northwest Florida in the past week.
