European inflation slipped into food
Accelerated inflation, recorded in the euro area, is primarily due to the dizzying rise in the price of food products.
The November price increase has been higher than expected in the 13 euro-zone countries, registering - after 2.6 percent in October - an annual inflation of 3.1 percent - announced the Luxembourg-based Union Statistics Office.
Official forecasts were as likely as 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the U.S., British and Canadian issuing banks, did not cut basic interest, on the pretext that the decline, along with rising commodity prices and a reduction in forced unemployment, would trigger a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least close to two percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in the 22:2 trap: “You have to negotiate” on inflation so that you don’t have to intervene on this issue later.
Germany’s 3.3 percent inflation broke the 12-year record, while Spain’s rose from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent.
Inflation skyrocketed in the euro area as a result of rampant food and energy prices.
Quotas for wheat rose by 88 percent and soybeans also reached their highest level since 1973.
Similarly, much more had to be paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil on the world market rose this year by 52 percent, reaching nearly $100 a barrel last month.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will jump from 2.1 percent today to 2.5 percent, while by 2009 it will drop to 1.9.
According to analysts, annual inflation will remain in the next 3 or 4 months around 3 percent, however the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to reduce interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup predicts a government crisis
After a long stagnation, by early December the support of the Young Democrats Alliance increased significantly, reaching its peak level since 2002, while Gallup never before experienced such a low level – 13 percent – in the case of socialists.
The difference in the case of confident party voters – due to the greater firmness of opposition voters – would mean support of more than two-thirds (71 percent) versus support of one-fifth for socialists (20 percent).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not reach the necessary limit to have any parliamentary seat: their support within the entire population is two percent.
Among confident voters there are one percent more sympathizers on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even compared to the previous low - it has never been so high, at 41 percent the proportion of those who deemed the economic situation of the country especially bad, while another 46 percent believe the situation is quite bad.
Families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about changing their own economic situation.
As for next year, the majority of the population is deteriorating and only one-tenth expects improvement.
In December, 71 percent of respondents, higher than any previous Gallup poll, estimated that the President of the Government performs his duties rather poorly than well.
13 percent of respondents trust or rely heavily on Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor Orbán has the support of 38 percent of respondents.
54 percent of the population doesn’t trust the head of government at all, and 27 percent don’t trust the president of the Young Democrats Alliance.
One indicator of the shaping of the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks it is possible to control the discontent experienced in front of the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While after the October riots last year 35 percent felt it would be desirable to keep the government and the head of government in power, currently this proportion is only 20 percent, while the relative majority (33 percent) believe that the only solution is to hold new elections.
Interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 percent of respondents to the participation question answered that they would surely participate and another 20 percent said they are likely to participate.
By comparison, in "a general election to be held this Sunday" would certainly only 55 percent of the population and another 15 percent believe likely their participation. Based on the current intentions of the voters there is no doubt of the result of the popular consultation.
74 percent of the population would disapprove of paying for school fees, 79 percent for medical consultations and 84 percent for hospital care.
If we look at these proportions only among confident participants in the referendum, 81, 84, and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of education fees, payment for medical consultations, and hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has quintupled its prices
The Budaörs gold trading triangle hypermarkets maintained the average price level increase of 16 percent, with the difference that VAT has not been increased this year.
Article by Napi Gazdaság
This year also increased by an average of 16 percent in the gold trading triangle of Budaörs the usual Christmas basket of the Napi newspaper, but in all hypermarkets there was a growth well above 1000 HUF.
As prices in food supermarkets had already been “triggered” in December last year, so there was no drastic percentage increase compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obviously frightening for consumers that what they were able to buy last year at a price well below HUF 9,000, today they can’t do it for even ten thousand.
The Napi basket in the hypermarkets studied exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF by a minimum of 91 HUF.
And the highest value basket was 10,573 HUF.
(In 2003 this basket cost 6,800 HUF.)
The price of Unicum liquor and fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a sharp increase in turkey breast fillet, nut and poppy seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed data from the Central Bureau of Statistics, although in Auchan we also found a kilo of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
The competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was also surprising at this store that the price of Coca-Cola with redimentable two-liter bottle cost less than 200 HUF, so this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost as little as 257 HUF.
However, in Napi Auchan’s basket it was the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, compared to last year’s Christmas prices, Cora rose by 15, while Tesco and Auchan rose by about 18 percent to Napi’s basket prices.
Comparing the values of last year’s most expensive basket with that of this year’s cheapest basket, the difference has been 12 percent, while growth between last year’s cheapest and this year’s most expensive one has been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year the average price growth was 1206 HUF, so that during Christmas last year prices were felt the increase in VAT.
It was precisely this process that shattered trade that supermarkets were visibly unable to make a decision on the price margin to be applied for each product and to calculate the effect of the price change on consumption.
(If the trader badly plans the speed of a product’s circulation, they may lose a significant profit on the margin that fits the sales volume.)
The increase in the price of the Napi basket reached such extremes as a result of the increase in VAT, which was the most expensive with 1720 HUF above the value recorded in 2006, while in the cheapest the difference was only 844 HUF.
This year there were no such extremes, since the highest price of now has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest also increased with 1284 HUF.
Comparing the two Christmas seasons, there was catastrophic price growth in less than 20 months, in hypermarkets the price of basic consumer goods grew by more than 30 percent.
(However, this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Bureau of Statistics: this office, in the case of some basic foodstuffs, recorded in the 12-month interval a price increase of more than 30 percent.
So, for example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of egg.)
According to the Napi basket, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, since in the price of this product that was quite expensive already last year compared to the base, it was recorded, in the worst case only a 10% increase in prices.
According to all the indices, the flour suppliers have a stronger position than those of eggs, being able to impose the drastic increase in prices even on multinationals.
Hypermarkets do not complain about the gold trading triangle, they constantly talk about positive results.
According to our experience, most consumers in the three stores visited are no longer interested in prices.
Of all the products they buy large quantities, with preserved food being carried by pallets.
On Wednesday morning, the three stores formed large queues in front of the boxes because the number of customers suddenly increased.
However, we have information that in the interior of the country the sales volumes are lower, many multinationals complain to the polling institutes because the income is below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in the case of appliances.
In many hospitals it is saved with disinfectants
This year several thousand infections have been registered in hospitals, primarily caused by the misuse of antibiotics.
The hygienic circumstances prevailing in hospitals, overcrowding of beds and overloading of staff do not favor the control of infections, says the chief medical officer of the National Center for Epidemiology.
In many hospitals it is saved even with disinfectants.
Recently, a MRSA infection has been diagnosed in the trauma department of János Hospital.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of the antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of infection occurred in this same hospital earlier this year.
One injured in a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital and the same patient soon after had to return to the hospital as a result of the MRSA infection and since then a major surgical intervention has not been possible due to the presence of the bacteria in his body.
Until December 10 this year, 1094 cases of hospital infection caused by multidrug-resistant agents have been registered in the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System - said Karolina Böröcz, chief medical officer of the department of the National Center for Epidemiology.
This means that the number of infections caused by multidrug-resistant agents has been safely recorded in hospitals, otherwise no information is available.
About two-thirds of infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, resistant to methicillin-oxacilin.
A third of humans carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without causing any disease.
Infections caused by AS (e.g., throat inflammation, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) react well to antibiotics and are easy to treat.
However, once applied exaggeratedly or improperly to antibiotics, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics become highly antibiotic-resistant bacteria and spread quickly in inadequate hospital conditions.
They can cause serious hospital infections, such as wound infections or sepsis in the first place to patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, patients with the weakened organism, the elderly or underweight people.
In the opinion of the doctor-director of the János Hospital there is nothing special about MRSA infection, these infections are everyday in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Resistant to antibiotics
"These patients are isolated, nurses take care of them in rubber gloves and mask and there are the right antibiotics for their treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Hospitalized patients are pre-screened for the presence of MRSA in their body, but even then infection cannot be prevented in all cases.
It is not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent hospital-based MRSA infections in most cases, however current national hospital circumstances do not favor the prevention of formation and contagion with multidrug-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate the diseases that carry MRSA in their bodies.
However, in Hungarian hospitals it is not fashionable to take microbiological samples.
This is also because the National Health Fund does not fund these medical tests.
So most cases come to light when already visible MRSA infections occur in the patient," said the epidemiological center's chief medical officer.
The European Union makes rigorous commendations for the application of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to treat infections and pathological conditions.
Efforts must be made to target antibiotic therapy, i.e. microbiological tests should be done to prevent drug resistance from occurring, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Microbiological sampling is even less frequent in the case of ambulant patients or in basic care - said Karolina Böröcz.
It is saved with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is spread from one patient to another through healthcare personnel.
Therefore, hand washing, the use of rubber gloves and masks play a very important role, however also in this sense considerable faults are experienced in hospitals.
MRSA is spread through droplet transmission and direct contact between people, however in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Moreover, hospital rooms are often crowded, beds are often very close together, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated at least by a distance of 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately you can also experience - added Karolina Böröcz - that in hospitals of less favorable economic situation is saved with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and that is why there is a greater probability for infection.
In the opinion of Karolina Böröcz, where appropriate preventive measures are followed, fewer such infections are recorded or the infection of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government Program Against MRSA
Treating the MRSA infection is a huge expense for the National Health Insurance Fund, so it is being fought in every country.
In England, for example, there is a government program to prevent and reduce MRSA cases.
Apparently the program is successful, according to the data provided, MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multidrug-resistant agents (including MRSA) and hospital infections due to these pathogens.
Negative alcohol control of the police commander who caused a fatal accident
The official expert report on the case of the fatal accident caused by the police commander of district XXII has been made.
The possibility that he was driving drunk or in a stunned state can be ruled out by the then resigned district police commander XXII, who on Tuesday ran over and caused the death of a passerby - reported Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman for the General Prosecutor's Office of the Capital, after the expert report on the case had been prepared.
The expert report confirmed the result of the primary control of alcohol which had already found that the former police commander did not drink alcohol before getting behind the wheel.
The then head of the police station of the XXII district, on Tuesday with his private vehicle by turning to Kossuth Lajos Street of the XXII district, ran over a 55-year-old man, who intended to cross the street, but not in the designated area for pedestrians.
(This last fact, that is, the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the regulations of the Traffic Code are not mitigating circumstances, the driver must always give way when bending.)
The passerby lost his life after being hospitalized.
The district police chief resigned and requested his retirement, according to the police statement, because he was deeply moved by the case.
The investigation of the case is carried out by the Budapest Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also said the former police commander from the start collaborated with prosecutors tasked with the investigation.
400 million euros more for infrastructure
Hungarian Finance Minister János Veres and European Investment Bank (EIB) Vice President Marta Gajecka signed on Friday in Budapest three credit limit agreements worth a total of 400 million euros to finance education, transport and environmental infrastructures, as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of EUR 300 million to finance in the Hungarian budget the transport and environmental protection projects, to be carried out by the subsidy of the Cohesion Funds, of which the parties had previously signed a credit agreement worth 100 million, the contract just signed refers to the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million loan contract is also earmarked to finance the budget for educational projects.
The EIB approved a total of EUR 300 million for this Hungarian objective, on the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later, by extending the loan contract.
The parties signed a contract for 50 million euros for innovations, which the budget will mainly use for the innovations and research project of the University of Debrecen.
During the talks they also covered the issue of the construction of the 4th line of the Metro.
The agreement was reached that by the time Hungary finalizes the details of the Metro’s financing with the EU, they will revisit the issue of whether or not the original contract should be amended and how to do so.
According to János Veres, this may take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990 the EIB has financed a total of EUR 8.4 billion of projects in Hungary.
The interest on the credits is adjusted to the EURIBOR and the EIB offers an 8-year grace period, without charge for keeping the credit available to the debtor.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
Admirable is the development of the Bulgarian real estate market - the attention of all of Europe is directed towards that Balkan country just mentioned.
What, where and who are buying in the even cheaper EU market, which will quickly become more expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred target for real estate acquisitions in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly Bulgaria, with its cheap ski slopes apartments and beach chalets.
The mountainous regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while in the Albena beaches, the "Golden Coast", the "Costa del Sol", the ancient Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people look for properties also in the surroundings of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, sooner or later the central area of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will arouse the interest of real estate developers and more and more people will buy real estate in the especially cheap area of Rus.
In the same way, the capital Sofia can be attractive, commercial and office spaces promise a rapid recovery of investment.
Bulgaria is on the best path to becoming one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, thus being a highlight destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, cautious investors are already making their purchases, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
In the opinion of analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria, also strive to change their life and way of life.
The majority of customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly from Romania.
Also present are the Maltese and Cypriot promoters and traditionally there are many Russian customers on the Black Sea beaches and ski paradises.
Foreign clients can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to settle here buy new or renovated properties for a price between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old houses in poor condition between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to renovate them later.
They require good communication and access, and for them it is important to be close to a large city, shops and usually a local doctor.
The second category consists of buyers of chalets (Bulgaria in December was included in the top 10 holiday destinations of the Germans).
The third group are real estate investors who make their purchases in the hope of benefiting in the medium or long term.
The price of capital real estate is constantly growing, as demand is increasing.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices, in the last five years these have suffered an annual increase of 21 percent.
The increase in the price of real estate considerably exceeds the growth of wages.
Fodor and the Six by Hundreds of Hungarians
As reported by the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor the meetings at the expert level will end on Tuesday and on Wednesday after the official inauguration will continue the negotiations at the level of ministers on the international climate regime after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are deliberating on the Bali Roadmap, which provides for efforts after the emissions reduction period, established by the Kyoto Protocol, in force until 2012.
Lively discussions are currently taking place between developing and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that at the moment it does not want to negotiate on precise figures, although it tends to agree that compared to the 1990 situation, until 2020 the emission of the gases responsible for the greenhouse effect will decrease by 25 to 40 percent.
Another major theme of the conference is whether or not industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are willing to offer material and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was also reached on the aid to be offered to developing countries.
The support fund, provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be run by a 16-member board of directors, likely within the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF).
Six Hundreds of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports the EU’s efforts to retain its leading role in global climate protection and promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The minister said the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020, compared to the 1990 level, regardless of whether or not the “post-2012 agreement” will be signed, and is willing to commit to a reduction of up to 30 percent if the world’s other major developed regions and developing countries are also willing to make commitments in line with their responsibilities and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the signatory countries to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol pledged to decrease by 5.2 percent, within this the then 15 EU member states pledged to meet an 8 percent decrease.
Hungary’s commitment is to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent over the period 1985-87, which our country will meet.
There is a lot at stake in Bali, since in two years the international agreement on long-term climate policy will have to be signed, because if not, it is certain that its entry into force would be postponed until after 2012. In this case the reduction commitments, assumed in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international system of emission reductions, whose need was warned in the most recent international partnership of the IPCC.
With this, the reduction of emissions would suffer a delay and a rise of more than 2°C in the average temperature of the Earth could not be prevented, a fact that according to scientists would have immeasurable and irreversible consequences.
British Army recruits on YouTube
British Army units in a video distributor publish footage of actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First the British Air Force (RAD) took advantage of YouTube services: special units displaced in Afghanistan since March 2006 are uploading videos about their actions against the Taliban, the BBC reported.
These recordings made with mini-cameras mounted on the helmets are controlled in Kandahar's general operating body, then sent to London for upload to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable.
Already 139 recordings from air force soldiers have been uploaded to the Internet in this way and its "channel" has already been seen by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered in the spring of 2007 under the name of "defence headquarters" and publishes videos of both actions perpetrated in Iraq and Afghanistan, while both the Ministry of the Commonwealth Office and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally the air force had uploaded the videos for recruitment purposes, but in the opinion of the Ministry of Defense they also serve to present to the public the true objective of the presence of the British army abroad.
This type of propaganda costs practically nothing compared to conventional television recruitment spots, defense expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC, but they inevitably have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the raison d’être of the military actions decided by the government.
The Americans made a video game.
The army is also concerned about the fact that, in addition to the carefully edited and censored recordings, amateur videos also appear on the distributor, for example on the deaths of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a little hypocritical, the officers speak as much as possible of losses, without however presenting the bloody part of the fights.
In addition, numerous videos recorded in real operations have been uploaded to the Internet from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, but the British army is only recently seizing this opportunity.
Americans use a slightly different form of recruitment with free-to-download video games called America's Army, in which in the midst of a more or less real situation the player can put himself directly in place of the soldiers.
Tombola and salty cake at the Christmas party of ministries
Labor Minister Mónika Lamperth does not seem very sentimental: instead of the Christmas party, she will hold a working meeting for her colleagues who will be able to say goodbye in 2007 with salty cake and coffee.
There is ministry that will celebrate its party with live music, in another they will create the Christmas atmosphere in the hearts of public officials with tombola and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - that's how you have fun.
State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held at the Ministry of Defense, but not for Ministry workers.
The children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts on the Christmas of the Orphans and for the Christmas of the Missionaries the relatives of the soldiers who are currently performing missions abroad will be invited, as well as a reception for the press.
This portfolio will allocate $25 million for the holiday atmosphere at the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will celebrate a luxurious holiday with respect to the holidays of the other portfolios
The celebration of the MET will be held in the House of the Future, with a total budget of 4,320,000 HUF and the ministry’s 600 workers are expected to attend approximately three hundred and fifty.
At the wallet party there will be a Christmas atmosphere, artists will also perform and there will be a tombola draw.
The ANF Christmas cost 4,700,000 HUF and was held Wednesday at the National Council of Justice (CNAJ) building with music concerts and dinner.
The rent of the hall cost one million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent on the more than 400 guests.
We have information that workers from one of the ANF departments are also invited to another Christmas party to be held by a contest management company called the Hungarian Center for Economic Development of Community Funds.
For this purpose they rented the entire building of the Theatre of Comedy.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, since we are unable to communicate with the competent person.
You can attend without a suit.
The CNAJ building not only hosted the ANF party, but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which instead of Christmas celebrated the dance of Lucia Day on December 7.
Their CNAJ did not charge anything for the use of their facilities.
Five hundred people participated in the dance.
The party began with the minister’s words of greeting and after dinner there was live danceable music.
Answering [origo's] question they reported: to attend the dance it was not obligatory to wear clothes or evening dress.
Health, work and local government portfolios are preparing for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a program and party for its workers in its own building with a budget of 400,000 HUF.
Labor Minister Mónika Lamperth does not wait for her colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for a holiday work meeting.
The participation of one hundred and eighty guests who - as the press department reported - will have only coffee and salty cake, so the party will not cost more than 350 000 HUF.
The minister for local governments, Gordon Bajnai, will instead simply toast with his colleagues in the classroom of the Ministry for Local Governments and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Christmas party in its own hall of events with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - from this budget will be paid the reception with buffet and a toast.
Since János Veres is the minister, MF workers celebrate Christmas in the same way every year.
Instead, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the schedule of the afternoon of its celebration.
The agriculture portfolio will offer a New Year’s reception on January 20, at the Ministry will not celebrate Christmas.
The reception will be held in the Vajdahunyad Castle of the Municipal Park and as communicated by the portfolio, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the one hundred guests.
This - according to the press department - will be a very simple reception standing, to which will be invited only the specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary.
These receptions, which are held every year, begin with a short greeting from the minister and conclude with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not celebrate any Christmas party - this is what the corresponding press departments have communicated to [origo].
In the press department of the environmental portfolio they were not able to report on the budget of the Ministry's Christmas celebrations.
What is known is that for the party to be held in the Museum of Applied Arts more than four hundred people were invited.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering
The League Unions and the National Federation of Workers’ Commissions will set up a strike commission on Friday to coordinate Monday’s strike that will last indefinitely.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while on Monday – the day on which the final vote on the public health law will be held – work stoppage will begin.
This action will certainly cause great difficulties in transport, since rail traffic will be completely stopped and until 13 hours workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company will also be on strike.
On Friday afternoon, the League Unions will report on the details of Monday’s strike that will be held jointly with the National Federation of Workers’ Commissions.
The strike commission of the LIGA and the National Union of Machinists will also be constituted, which will coordinate Monday’s actions.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while participating unions will strike indefinitely on Monday if no agreement is reached with the government.
This means that - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the public health law - they did not report on the date of the end of the strike initiated.
If the National Assembly disapproves of the public health law, the unions will immediately withdraw their call for strikes.
Instead, if the law is passed, strike committees will meet and decide on the future.
On the basis of the National Assembly’s Monday agenda, it is also possible to vote only on the public health law in the late hours of the night, or at least near midnight.
As a result of the strike that will start on Monday, there will be significant difficulties in transport: railways will be stopped indefinitely, in the morning a part of public transport in Budapest and more than half of the intercity bus transport of Volán companies may be stopped.
Simultaneously, in many parts of the country, half of the roads will be closed.
Numerous unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League’s website.
Some unions announced their strike indefinitely, others for a definite time.
Until Thursday afternoon the State Railway and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) could not reach an agreement even on the minimum services, although, as the Christmas holidays approach, more and more people travel on trains.
According to information received so far, from the beginning of the day until 1 p.m. workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company will be on strike, Budapest Airports from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m., will hold a four-hour strike the LIGA Trade Unions of the Electrical and Thermal Energy Industry, the Educators’ Trade Unions called for a strike of 2 a.m. and the 8 a.m.
The Hungarian Association of Physicians will pronounce on national strike at alternative times and the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers (SDTSSS) that are part of the Forum for Trade Union Cooperation, will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is for the government to withdraw its proposal on public health reform and submit a new conception to a social debate.
The second demand is that they gradually introduce the new way of calculating pensions that will come into force next year.
The third is to ensure, even before 2010, in the case of advanced pensions the possibility that the occupations that deserve it can enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF), which is part of the League Trade Unions, do not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the railway sidelines and expect another different proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: The country increases the risk by the Hungarian Guard
According to the Political Capital’s Risk Analyzing Division, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, set up in August this year with the support of the Better Hungary Movement, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region from various points of view.
The company's "risk warning" states: "In relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is the fact that with the escalation of ethnic tensions between the gypsy and non-gypsy population of Hungary, even in the short term, violent ethnic clashes may occur."
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is probably the provocation of an event of this nature, added the representative of the research institute.
They affirmed that all this is due to one of the main faults of the protagonists of Hungarian political life: "the protagonists of public life gave the public debate of the gypsy problem to the representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who were able to base their political strategy on the existing discrepancies between gypsies and Hungarians".
This aggravates the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts breaking out.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activity of the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of the national and international media, "significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of the stability and democratic development of the country."
They remind us that since the autumn of 2006 the reorganization of radical and far-right groups in Hungary has received increasing publicity and momentum and that since the summer of 2007 numerous organizations have been formed in the country that define themselves as "associations of national self-defense".
“The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil organizations, while openly proclaiming the training of their members for defense – even armed – (civil defense, national defense, defense of public order), alluding to the ineptitudes of the police, of the army, that is, of the state.”
They asserted: all this occurs in accordance with the method that attempts to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on society’s discontent with politics and political parties.
Highlighting the civil and the form of association in the case of these associations not only serves to avoid the legal problems of legal registration, but is at the same time also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also a risk factor from the point of view of neighbourly relations.
In recent months, many neighboring states have referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential danger, while ultra-nationalist political figures from certain neighboring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All of this influences the political stability of the region,” they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so political risks increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard works in a similar way to, for example, the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (UNB).
The constitution of the Bulgarian guard is due to the massive riots of the gypsies that occurred in one of the neighborhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, the UNB decided to set up the guard, arguing that the organization’s goal is “national self-defense.”
In his view, in the last 17 years there has been “gypsy terror” in Bulgaria, yet the state remained powerless and indifferent to the facts.
They added: This initiative has provoked a lively discussion in Bulgarian public opinion.
As it was written, it indicates the increased risk of ethnic clashes that certain Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced that to resist, they will constitute their own guard.
As the functioning of the Hungarian Guard has so far shown similarities to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that Hungarian gypsies also react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defense - it can be read in the warning about the risks of Political Capital.
Political Capital’s director of research, Attila Juhász, told the news agency: “Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, each year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can influence the change of risk, they inform the public, as happened in this case, publishing their warning about the risks.
Party is not always written with red numbers
In Hungary the law precisely defines the days that are written with red numbers on the calendar and it has already become a widespread practice that around holidays - which next year will be less - workdays are reorganized.
Even in the EU and North America, the holidays are not unitary.
Hungarian laws make a difference between national holidays, state holidays and public holidays.
The festive days are mainly related to religious festivals and historical ephemeris.
Let us celebrate the New Year too: both the last day of the old year, and the first day of the new year is festive - the latter especially so that you may rest those who have spent celebrating the old year.
Throughout the year we have eleven parties written with red numbers on the calendar.
It is a national holiday on March 15 in memory of the revolution of 1848 and on October 23, commemorating the revolution of 1956.
On August 20th we celebrate the foundation of the State, on May 1st we celebrate Labor Day, on November 1st and 2nd we remember our deceased family and friends.
In addition, in our country there are two-day feasts of Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious holidays rarely coincide with a weekend, so it often bridges when there is only one working day before or after the holiday.
In exchange for the extended weekends thus, during the previous Saturdays you cannot be absent from work or school.
It is the minister of labor who regulates in his specific decree when it is necessary to work exactly in exchange for the day directly before or after the feast.
This legal standard is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and public officials.
It is not mandatory for companies and service institutions that, due to their role, work continuously even during holidays.
This year the work order can be changed only around the holidays of the end of the year: from December 24 practically stops life in the country, since according to experiences, most people "bridge" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
Next year several of our holidays will coincide with mid- or weekends, so there will be fewer changes in working days than this year.
First the agenda around the Labor Day will be modified so that then, for four successive days, workers can rest.
On Saturday, April 26 will be a working day, so that in return Friday, May 2 will be a holiday.
The other change is related to the party of October 23: on Saturday, October 18, you will have to work instead of Friday, October 24.
On the other hand, the next year during the holiday will be able to rest, since from December 24 it will not work almost anywhere, even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six Small Disincentives to Bitter Your Colleagues’ Lives
Emails that we forget to send, sound messages that we never receive, innocent lies that pass on to us without us noticing: they are all part of our everyday folklore at work.
Decide whether to adapt to small inconveniences or consciously avoid confusing situations that can irritate others.
Advice.
“Sorry, I forgot to let you know you were picked up from the marketing department,” one of your colleagues said.
That's why you didn't go on a date?
At best, he’s sorry and tries to fix the issue, perhaps calling the marketing department to tell them that he forgot to deliver the message to you (this is the least common solution).
Most of the time the matter is resolved by apologizing.
Before you go on with nasty explanations, it’s worth meditating on the things you can make your colleagues’ lives bitter and consciously strive to avoid them.
Do you borrow something that is not yours?
There’s nothing more annoying than when you want to grab a document, office supplies, or your phone and you can’t find them.
Remember yesterday you put the stapler on the table, but this morning it's gone?
Can you find your lost pen on the table of one of your colleagues?
Don’t take anything away from your colleagues without asking them, because they will rightly be angry with you for stealing their stuff.
Do not pick up envelopes or post-it from the office because it can be unpleasant when you need them immediately and they run out ahead of time.
Do you gossip about the privacy of your colleagues?
There is no good solution to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what is he doing and with whom?
Where and why?
Don’t pass on to everyone the information (suggestions) you have about the private lives of your colleagues!
Don’t abuse your colleague’s trust when he shares his innermost secrets with you!
Bury in yourself what you have heard and do not gossip about your colleague in his absence, although others also know the things about him.
Are you going on sick leave unjustifiably?
When you call the office on the phone and say you’re sick and your head hurts unbearably, you feel bad or good, you feel like that day you prefer to rest; think that others must do your work, your impassable tasks, your work for good.
Don't bother your colleague!
If you already know in advance that the next day you will not go to the office or something can happen to you, so you will have to stay at home, tell them, so that your colleagues or your boss do not have to face your absence the next day.
Landings, laughs, phone calls
Are you involved in your work, but are you suddenly taken out of it by your colleagues’ chuckles?
Have you unintentionally heard a phone call that would have been better not to hear?
Don’t bother your colleagues with your chanting, singing, loud conversations (less when you do them above their head), kicking, constant blasphemies, expressing your discontents aloud.
All of these can be annoying, even if they aren’t delving into a project right now (writing, planning, organizing).
Do you blame others for a mistake?
Don’t blame others if you haven’t finished something in time, you forgot to send an important letter or message!
Don’t allude to the chaos eventually reigning in the office, or the noise your colleagues make!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that harms others and you must make amends for the mistake!
Ask how you can repair your fault!
Do you feel at home in the office?
Jogging and slippers: very comfortable habit for the house, but not suitable for the office!
Do not wear a comfortable jog even if your occupation allows it!
Don’t get messed up, respect your colleagues and yourself by wearing everyday clothes, elegant and beautiful when your occupation requires it!
Lose interest if you want to meet the expectations of the public
The car moves slowly into the usual morning jam.
Sounds like a strange compass on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I'll turn up the volume.
It changes the rhythm of the music and to the previous tones the bass is added and then the voice of a female choir as a true jewel intervenes.
The mr2 channel plays the song Wings of Love by Zagar.
National musical life didn’t spoil us much with quality electronic pop.
But now this jam looks totally different when you’re listening to Zagar’s new record.
Yonderboi appears. Some new and interesting songs of the underground [b2]digital [b3]national are gradually changing the image and although again it is fashionable garage style rock, breaks guitars, the national electro pop has shown: there are novelties under the sun.
Balázs Zságer began his career in the city of Pécs, playing in the Yonderboi ensemble until he began his independent career perhaps because both can not be protagonists of the same ensemble.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mix of jazz, danceable electronic music and pop, he tried to succeed, when asked for soundtracks [b4]cinematographics (pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The wider audience knew the ensemble that initially performed only in small clubs when wan2 magazine selected its first album released in 2002 among the fifty most important national albums, ranking Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national trend trainer, able to sell also in Western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his ensemble are in fashion, but no one has asked them whether or not they like this label.
The ensemble reacted as it should: it prepared a new and even better record.
The newly released album, titled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, will be able to open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the initial years in the city of Pécs.
For this title was one of the lines of the ancient set of Balázs Zságer.
The reference to the airy, the flying, but in addition to the airy music, now appeared - according to the spirit and trend of the time - the guitar that sounds louder, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the album at the Millennials György Ligeti, the singer who currently works in England with the ensemble The Puzzle.
The album includes a real success of the channel mr2 Petõfi that lately broadcasts popular music. This station brought to the ears of radio listeners the high-flight music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground).
Everything is in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Balazs Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success the question arises: what are you playing, to what extent is a music dedicated to a select audience?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of select audience means little to me.
In my opinion there are two types of castes in light music; not mainstream and underground[b5], not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also the so-called underground alternative music can be boring, meaningless and can be composed equally only for sale, which makes it commercial.
But also a good pop song can come from a sincere inspiration.
Also the attitude of the listeners works in this spirit, regardless of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by Hungarian and foreign audiences?
B. Zs: Abroad, especially in the west of us, light music has bigger traditions.
There not only the fifteen and twenty-year-olds attend the concerts, but also the older ones.
They pay much more attention to the changes that occur around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they come from and how many people are listening to your music?
B.Zs: Of course I feel good to see more and more people attending our concerts.
But we have never written music for the market.
We do not compose music for some purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience is rather felt in concerts where there is a reciprocal influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, you lose their interest.
hvg.hu: To what extent do you intend to follow Yonderboi’s example?
He works alone and made his career rather to the west of us.
B.Zs: We don’t follow their path, even though they sometimes try to compare our music to theirs.
We rather work as a team, rely on the musical presence of the other and let it unfold.
At first it was inevitable that they would compare our work to the music of Yonderboi, as many of us started our career in his group and from there we embarked on another path.
hvg.hu: Mr. Petõfi Wings of Love's hit list is in first place.
Many people first heard Zagar's name in connection with this song.
Did you consciously open up this style to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn’t intend to compose big hits and sell our album with these hits.
This song is more than that.
We added it to the end of the record, trying to relax after the sound orgy of the record and the heavier tracks.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why precisely to them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a gospel-style choir.
Then came the idea to create this chorus of good-voice soloists from our own national musical stage.
Thus was created that choir of six women - namely Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh - who was then baptized as Divas of Underground.
hvg.hu: Did you write the song exactly that way or did the girls change some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed a long time ago in an instrumental version and when we already had all the material on the record, we thought something was still missing.
The chord attracted the singing.
Even that night I recorded the song that the girls later learned.
It all came pretty much on the first try and incredibly spontaneously.
I remember, I was very excited at the time, but of course I also needed the divas.
With my voice it would not have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both in the concert and on the record it seems as if the girls were in the background.
There are no soloists (except Judy Jay’s short solo), they have no role of their own, they all sing together and not louder than the music, so the music doesn’t just accompany their songs.
They are also on stage in the background.
Intentionally?
B.Zs: They are at the bottom simply because of technical problems.
Instead, we consciously didn’t want to distribute soloist roles.
The song is also about it, about forgetting our ego for a while, about who it came from and where it goes, so let those wings, the wings of love, lift us up.
I would have liked to make others feel the euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: Which one did you dedicate the most work to?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition actually none, rather when it came to mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example the Dorian Gray’s Dilemma where I’m playing on a concert piano or the Rock’n’Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I didn’t want the groove to work and then, little by little, everything was put back in place like in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new album?
Zs.B.: This constantly changes with the concerts and because I have already "released" the record.
Now Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth, and Never The Same.
A treacherous broker risks billions for his inferiority complex
A disloyal embezzler.
This is what his former employee Jerome Kerviel, the French banker giant of Société Générale, also owner of the Czech Bank of Commerce, points out.
He lost about five billion euros for it.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and, without a doubt, with good abilities.
He long ago intuited, unlike all major Czech banks, the crisis in the American mortgage market.
“He has a fragile character” he let himself be heard by his superiors, the same ones who sent him to the police.
But what emerges from Kerviel’s responses as reflected in French media outlets, such as the newspaper Le Monde, is that he was a man who at the end of last year made a profit of more than 1.6 billion euros thanks to his business.
Crisis not only in America
“All I wanted to do was make money for my bank,” he says in his responses.
In the summer, he won 500 million euros during the American crisis.
This opportunity has already seen her come earlier this year.
In February, some news began to be heard about so-called sub-prime mortgages offered to low-income customers or those who in the past had problems with payments and that those customers would begin to have problems.
However, this crisis should not affect the entire economy.
Kerviel didn’t believe it and bet correctly.
And then, at the end of the year, his earnings exceeded 1.6 billion euros.
“When I won my first 500 million I didn’t know how to notify him,” Kerviel says, adding that he has left nothing to himself at all.
Throughout the interrogation he stated that he had falsified the records in such a way that his discovery was not reached.
He even tricked the bosses, even as the Eurex Stock Exchange began to take an interest in his business.
The risk became a benefit
Were you afraid that it might be discovered?
Rather, no.
“I thought I had made $1.6 billion for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would make them happy.”
Where did you get so much willpower to take that risk?
In my position I had to work gradually.
He joined Société Générale in 2000, after completing his studies in Lyon.
His annual salary was between $51,000.
Two years later he was already an assistant stockbroker and in 2005 he became a stockbroker with an annual salary of $90,000.
I knew I would never win as much as the others.
“In my first interview in 2005, I noticed that they looked at me with caution.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress," Kerviel told the researchers.
But soon after my entry into the company came the first big success.
Thanks to the actions of Allianz he won, during the bombings in London, playing down a title of 500 million euros.
And that was a start-up mechanism, and he wanted more.
If you win, we'll leave you.
“This is like a snowball,” police said.
But it is said that the bosses knew all this or rather suspected it.
“While earning money, they closed their eyes.”
Only then came the coup earlier this year.
In one day he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January he wanted to wipe out all the footprints.
When he got to work on Monday, he no longer worked at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros because of it.
And how did they find him?
He became a suspect after his vacation.
“I chose only four days for the past year.
The runner who doesn’t have a vacation is a runner who doesn’t want anyone to take a look at his file,” Kerviel said.
The Czech Republic has the chance to raise $365 billion.
Ministers of the Czech government signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission from which the Czech Republic can obtain 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion kronor).
This is almost half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
From seven operational programmes, approximately 125 billion kronor will come out for the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion kronor from the Enterprise and Innovation Program.
Most of the money will go to transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of the operational programmes and represents up to 22 percent of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the state fund for transport infrastructure that next year will have the amount of 90.8 billion kronor.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation program should serve entrepreneurs and companies for obtaining resources in business innovation.
Companies should obtain funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
As far as the current use of EU funds is concerned, the Czech Republic is among the newly entered countries that use them the least.
Twenty-year sentence for former Nicaraguan president, court ruled
On Thursday, the Nicaraguan Court of Appeals handed down a 20-year sentence for the country’s former president, Arnaldo Alemán, who was convicted in 2003 for the embezzlement of 100 billion dollars (almost 1.8 billion kronor).
Despite this, a while later, he was released from prison to go to house arrest on his farm not far from the Nicaraguan metropolis.
It is not clear at the moment, according to the AP agency that, the then head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002, is back behind bars.
According to the president of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Pérez, it will rather depend on the prison officers if they let Alemán finish his punishment at home or if they make him return to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved how German constantly transferred money from the government to a company account in Panama.
This society was fictitious and the account actually belonged to its closest relatives and supporters.
Part of this money ended up in the fund that Germans created to fund their campaign in the 2001 election.
This is how the budget was approved.
That's right.
The State Budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first developed by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year’s budget was already approved with the support of the SSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and the SSD could not afford not to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the confidence vote in the government, nothing dramatic happened this time around.
The Parliamentary Assembly, in this traditional but most influential view, quietly passed the new law.
It is a great paradox.
Each government begins and ends with each chapter and part of the budget, whether they like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics but it hides the power rivalry between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the media and for this reason they pay special attention to it.
Political discussions are much more interesting than mere numbers.
The State Budgets of the last Social Democrat governments suffered from three flaws that for this year 2008 it is not possible to solve so easily:
The first of these is the high participation of the mandatory laws, called as of expenses of the presidents that are not only pensions but also social benefits that already last year were approved before the elections by the "silent" coalition of the SSD and KSOM.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the public funding deficit, such as the municipal and community budget deficit.
Despite this, the greatest risk is not in the deficit of the State Budget.
It is public and relatively under control.
The clock pump, however, is in the deficit of the municipal and community budget.
Many mayors in order to obtain other sources of investment, apart from money from taxes, fees and credits from banks, often issued meaningless obligations with which they disproportionately indebted their municipalities.
In recent years they managed to pay off these debts through the massive sale of energy shares and other development networks they received from the state and privatization.
They currently do not have this resource.
If we stick only to official and verified facts, we find that:
Our economy, a few years ago, is going through phases of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, of which SSD boasts.
This was the ideal occasion for his government to order the finances of the state.
Instead, however, the state continued to indebted.
The rest of the countries, with the exception of some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, saved much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great embarrassment that falls, above all, in the previous government.
We belong to nations that within global measures are less threatened by poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programs which, unfortunately, in recent years have been uselessly inflated with gigantic measures.
And while they managed to eliminate some of the incomprehensible populist spending passed this year before the election, if the retirement age and pension reform do not change soon, then it will be the end of any policy in this country, and whoever governs it will only be a mere bureaucracy.
To exaggerate a little we can say that the politicians who govern will be transformed into officials, mechanical dispensers of most of the money from taxes to retirement and social benefits.
Therefore, this year’s budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of normal spending from the expenses of the presidents.
The planned deficit of more than $70 billion by 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary, had the past government not wasted in the last ten years what they could.
We do not want the politicians who govern to become just officials so we must be patient and grant this weak coalition government, which realizes that the state can only spend what it is able to get from taxes and fees, peace of mind for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
Only this will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced State Budget.
Ji? Krej?
Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks have decided to fight together against the financial market crisis.
In the Monetary Marking will receive more than one hundred billion dollars through tenders.
In these tenders the banks auction the interest rates for which they are able to lend money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will send forty billion dollars to bid, and then another twenty-four billion dollars will be facilitated by the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the September 11 attacks, it is the first time that central banks of different states have agreed on this coordinated process to protect and mitigate the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step must solve the biggest economic problem, that is, the continued growth of the free capital shortage that banks could lend," Bernard Baumohl of consultancy Economic Outlook Group wrote in his report to clients.
“This coordinated action by central banks probably slowed the U.S. recession from 65 percent to 50 percent,” Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent $60 billion on unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Economists still expect billions in losses.
“Central banks must really be afraid of what awaits them when they decide to take this step,” said Kieran Davies, chief economist at ABN Amro.
“It looks like the situation is really wrong,” he added.
Central banks fear that they have the same problems with access to loans and will therefore have to lend more expensively to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the U.S. economy into recession with different impacts on the growth of the global economy.
The central banks thus decided, after failing to reduce the so-called LIBOR tariff, the London interbank tariff that is used for lending money in the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to lend money even as the central banks of the US, Canada and Britain lowered their interest rates several times during the fall.
"It will have the same effect as another fall in interest rates," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some economists are not surprised that the step taken by central banks helps to ignite the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the housing market in the United States.
Klaus: The debates of the environmentalists are incredible
Global climate change mainly affects developing countries.
President Václav Klaus spoke again on the issue of global warming.
Criticism has now emerged with the closure of the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not Green Planet, he said the debates of environmentalists are incredible.
According to Klaus it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mixture of government representatives and non-governmental organizations but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and the reality.
"There the debates are hardly structured, they are fireworks of words, substitutes for the solution to the current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech president during the presentation of his book stressed that this topic is very important to him and that is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy at discovering his book translated into German because, as he said, "many times I find only the caricature of my ideas".
Now interested parties can find out about their varied opinions.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but that he has, in his opinion, enough assumptions to write a book like this.
He is academic, with the ability to follow and judge a specialized dissertation, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
At the time of the closure he expressed his thought that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that there is no agreement among scientists on global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not so great and serious, nor do they represent possible disasters, and that attempts to influence climate development are useless, ineffective and costly unacceptable.
Moreover, as an experienced man with totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous way to limit the freedom of others.
To the questions of those present he repeatedly explained that he is not against “reasonable defenders of the environment but against environmental activists who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits.”
Klaus spoke on the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600,000 people were unable to change their driver’s license
Six hundred thousand drivers were passed the date and therefore did not manage to change their old driver’s license whose validity ends at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can request the change for officials to give them time until the end of the year to issue the new card.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after the New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers will be found on the roads without the valid card.
According to traffic, the card has not been changed mainly by those who no longer want to drive.
While in the villages they announce a rapid decline in the change of the carnet, the offices of the metropolis are full of requests and the interest for the new carnet has increased.
The City Council estimates about 2,000 daily customers.
Waiting in the queues for half an hour.
In Prague, around 140,000 drivers have not yet been released.
The issuance of a new card lasts twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the issuance of the card within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay 500 kronor.
Drivers who must change their license and do not reach until the end of the year, but will go out on the roads without the valid license will risk a fine starting in January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The policeman can fix the breach with a warning.
In the event of an administrative infringement, the fine will amount to 2,500 kronor.
According to the above information, a fine could be received by a person who does not go anywhere.
They could presumably pay up to 30,000 kronor.
The Ministry appealed to the offices to moderately enter fines of 1,000 kronor, at most.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, the fines of a thousand crowns do not threaten anyone.
According to him, the driver’s license is a document in which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not the identity card that each person must have valid.
People who do not want to drive should give up their driver’s license.
Just bring it or send it by certified mail to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year, the cards issued during 1964 and 1993 cease to be valid.
However, drivers will have to gradually change the other types of driver’s license.
People with the document between 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the card that was issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the sentence to Berdych's accomplices detectives
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Ko?a?k accused of complicity with the criminal David Berdych will spend between thirteen and ten years in prison.
The High Court of Prague decided as a final expiration the reduction of penalties, the first to one year, and the second to two years.
The detectives of the department prague against organized crime would initially fall between 14 and 12 years.
It is no longer possible to appeal against today's decision, only by revocation by the High Court.
Berdych is also charged in this case but he is awaiting the verdict of the Court of First Instance in the first place.
In other cases, he has already been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
He can't get any more.
In January, the District Court acknowledged the involvement in the 19-person robbery and the Superior Court today revoked 16 of them.
Most of the defendants’ allegations were rejected by the investigation for being fabricated causes.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, members of the police in agreement with Berdych passed information from police sources to the criminals, covered up the thefts, and helped members of the criminal group avoid penalties.
These criminals turned over 30 percent of their robbery to Opava and Ko?a?k.
The indictment refers to the criminal acts carried out by the group between 1999 and 2001.
As far as the theft is concerned, its victims have suffered serious impacts on their health but are also accused of abuse of power as public agents and without a gun permit.
In the home registry, police found pistols, steel-core ammunition, a laser conductor and a machine gun.
The group of criminals, according to the indictment, stole tens of millions of crowns from them.
With the exception of nearly 20 men in this trial, the court has already found Berdych and other defendants guilty.
Other men related to Berdych’s case are still declaring other processes, and in some cases have not yet appeared.
Toma and Maro, who have so far avoided trial, are in prison in Ireland where they await the final decision on their surrender to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
A count to change a few children: 12 million
By changing some children in the maternity home, the lawyer of the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants 12 million kronor of compensation from the hospital in T?ebi? plus the costs of the trial.
For each of the mothers, three million, for the fathers, two million, and for the children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The hospital’s legal representative, Ondcej Dostál, disagrees in principle with Veleba’s proposal.
"Such a demand we don't approve, it's too high," Dostál said after today's meeting.
“In order to get an idea of this counterproposal, we need the report of the specialist that the counterparty ordered to investigate.
We'll find out if it has a rescission value.
We stand by the view that it will be hundreds of thousands for everyone,” Dostál said.
The amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each parent.
At the beginning of the case, Jablo’s family wanted, for every month they didn’t raise their biological daughter, a million crowns.
Velaba served as the basis for negotiating compensation for the specialist’s report, only this was prepared at the hospital of Motol faculty in Prague.
The parents of the girls, according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry, suffered from psychological impact and stress of different levels and depth.
The stressful situation was better endured by the men even though they struggled with recriminations for the girls’ change.
Women get worse with the trauma they are currently experiencing and with respect to what is happening today, Veleba said.
Veronica and Nicola were switched by nurses at the Maternity Home in T?ebi? last year, on December 9th.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the Chermakovs in P?ibyslavic, and Veronica to Libor Bro? and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jablo?.
At the end of October, the governor of Vysoina, Milo Vystril, handed each family 100,000 crowns as compensation expenses for the mistake made at the hospital in Tööbița that the region administers.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law as liability for damages.
In case of errors they must extract from the reserve fund and can extraordinarily ask the administrator for help.
The court to date has awarded them a proportionately low compensation, the sums that were calculated according to the tables that count in hundreds of thousands and extraordinarily of one million kronor.
Polívka lost the Kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Polívka lost the lawsuit over the trademark Kingdom of Wallachia.
According to the judge of the provincial court of Ostrava, he was the first to use the brand Kingdom of Wallachia but the project was created for many years by Tom? Harabi? with whom the actor collaborated.
Polívka did not appear for oral hearing today.
According to your lawyer, the case is probably not over and your client will appeal.
"The lawsuit is that Mr. Harabic and his team are parasites of the popularity of Bolek Polivka," Polivka's lawyer said after the trial.
For him, before the words Kingdom of Wallachia, everyone gets the image of the actor and comedian.
The same idea also has Harabi.
“We’ve been working for about ten years.
Searching for money and inventing activities,” he said.
For him, the cause of the lawsuit lies in the money.
"After years I have realized that the project is successful and that I could also receive something.
They want to live like parasites in our work,” he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, the trademark Kingdom of Wallachia was first used by Polívka in his television program.
In 1993 he was crowned by the actor Radoslav Brzobohat.
Then it wasn’t about orienting him toward creating a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi came up with editing the passport of the Kingdom of Wallachia.
From this comical origin came a business and a lucrative business activity from which Harabi created the Kingdom of Wallachia.
In 1997, Polivka agreed to use his name and signature in passports and even offered his owners discounts to visitors to his farm and attendees of his shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also ruled that Harabi used only a simple idea that Polivka made public on stage for his own business benefit.
“It is clear that Bolek Polivka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Wallachia,” the judge said.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project is Harabi and his team who dedicated themselves to it completely.
The collaboration, between the now decomposed parts, continued until the year 2000 when Harabic organized for Polivka the official coronation in Vsetin.
From that moment on there began to be conflicts between Polivka and Harabi, the culmination of which came with the overthrow of "King Boleslav I, the chosen one forever".
The leading role in the kingdom, through the mediation of Harabi, derives from the singer Jarmila Ulakova, as queen mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed an indictment against Harabic and his company, which has been rejected by the court to this day.
Something clear could bring in the litigation, the tournament for the throne with its princesses, which is already preparing Harabi.
From him should come the new king.
He did not want to reveal any more data or dates.
“We are in no hurry.
It would have to be something like the king's road to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr. Polivka can come forward,” Harabi added.
Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi test: prejudices overcome
I’ve never really liked the Peugeot 206.
Its gear characteristics were never anything special, the quality of the gearbox, maneuvering and also the product could be characterized as below average.
But now there is a successor on the market, the Peugeot 207, and this one is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little more advanced and to me, I just have to think about it better.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five-door, I complained, for example, about the headroom in the rear seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the body of the Combi means in this sense, that I will not suffer before the two meters long.
Flying around the world
I walk through the interior quickly so as not to repeat it too much.
It is an elegant design where the only flaw is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would appreciate the design invention even though the car already looks quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are times when we complained about short seats and backrests.
Also unlike the model 206, the lateral steering has improved considerably.
And the space?, and here you can feel how the measurements of the body have grown.
In the Combi disappears the aforementioned scarcity of space in the header.
Luggage in the trunk
But the main thing in this vehicle is its trunk.
This should be valued as very accessible (thanks to the folding rear door) and a well-distributed storage.
The dead spaces are equipped with rubber straps that are an ideal solution.
They do not bother, and can be extended to the point of holding heavy objects.
But let's stay in the warehouse.
According to the tables, in basic regime it has a capacity of 428 liters which compared to the competition is rather an average value.
But not in comparison to the best-selling vehicle of the same type in the Czech Republic, the Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of Mladá Boleslav’s model, we find that the Peugeot lags behind with its noticeable 52 liters.
On holiday abroad or when placing the child’s stroller its value is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive then I must quote the floor that is quite flat after knocking down the backs of the second line.
120 horses in four marches
Our tested car was equipped with an injection ignition of four valves on a capacity of 1.6 l. and a force of 88 kW.
And to tell the truth, this is what a 1600 should look like that would be disparaging the family member five doors.
It is quiet, consumes little and above all, has momentum.
If I compare it to the time of the Skoda that seemed like the exhaust pipe was plugged by a rag, I can say that with this I can be impressed.
The prices respond
The price of the car is not for every pocket.
We must, however, bear in mind that we have tested a vehicle elegantly equipped and with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with injection ignition from 1400 to 329,900 crowns, can still be.
Our aggregates put it from 410,900 kronor, which is already too much.
The tested Premium type already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Only that we would still have airbags in the headers, automatic air conditioning, automatic windscreen wiper, automated rear windows...
That is, the car with everything costs 531,900 kronor.
It’s a lot, but count with the complements of the team in the Fabia and it will reach a fairly similar number.
Now it remains to be decided by which of the two brands.
Slovak students do not integrate into English schools
English schools are attended by children from Eastern European countries and as a result, locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans for now brings only a number of problems.
Even British schools record cases where conflicts between emigrants and native children increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools is well illustrated in the northern city of Kent, where conflicts between natives and Slovak emigrants are beginning to grow.
Discussions, extortion and scolding among students have already reached even their own parents.
The situation has gone so far that Chatmam police arrested a Slovak woman who was sticking sticks to a ten-year-old student with a green stick.
In her defense, she said the girl was insulting her son with racist tones.
Police also had to act after an attack by two underage girls on a Slovak migrant.
The girls harassed him with racist insults and threw stones at him.
“When we were going home, a boy approached us at the bus stop and started spitting at us.
When I told him to leave, he made the move to throw apples and pears at us, and then he lowered his pants and showed us his ass," she described another nasty incident to The Times, the Slovak student's mother.
Complaints are from both sides.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with eastern European emigrants as a struggle for survival.
The cases already mentioned above show us how the environment in English schools is starting to be quite tense.
In Britain there are 70,000 Slovaks who came here for work.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is truly the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can be met, as long as you choose correctly.
Sandy and golden beaches, big waves or a calm sea like a pond.
the palm trees and the whole enclosed with waiters offering pizzas on the beach, ice cream or various cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the Caribbean Sea island you can find all this and much more.
Only on one island does it find much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands in the Greater Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Columbus called it, the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a storehouse and cargo port for the treasures that the Spaniards extracted from America and brought to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional grew in the late 1920s.
It was built by one of the bosses of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, since everything that was criminal in the United States (and therefore prohibited) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, gambling and prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, tall buildings emerged, along wide avenues ran cars that were a symbol of worship in the 50s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a hacienda in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio left their signatures the stars of the world of entertainment and politicians from all over America.
What about today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita you can also leave your autograph.
In the bar of the dear Hotel Nacional you will mix the cocktails according to your wishes.
And those cars already cult of the 50s, to this day still operate in Havana, because those Lada and Fiat that arrived a long time ago have oxidized between these wet and salty winds.
Even though Havana, especially the old quarter, is deteriorating markedly, there are not as many wonderful colonial monuments as there.
Other places are metamorphosed into beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much needed money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is unique in the world and is highly valued by railroad lovers.
Sugar cane is transported from the huge plantations to the sugar mills by narrow means in steam or electric machines.
Their carpools for decades were not discovered and now they are there, machines that work and whose sibling models that exist in other parts of the world are only found in museums.
Where to go?
The best known place for most visitors does not change.
And for that reason, it is not necessary to talk more about Havana or Varadero.
Perhaps, just remember that in the aforementioned Hemingway Hacienda there is a museum that for those who are lovers of the writer, should not fail to visit it.
The Viñales Valley is the most picturesque corner of Cuba to the west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation that grows in limestone lands.
Mogotes, pillars of limestone and steep rocks in the falls of the valley, and in their caves acclimate fertile lands thanks to which are formed rocks that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is probably the place where the highest quality tobacco is grown in Cuba.
Visiting one of the Habana cigar factories you can find your final product.
Perhaps it’s interesting that the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman, was filmed there.
Trinidad
Old Abolengo city that was founded not long after the Spaniards colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
Wealth became beauty with the constructions in the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by later French settlers, in four centuries has hardly changed.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Sierra de Escambray, is such a secluded place that even in the 50s of the last century there was no road that linked it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built and therefore nothing was destroyed either, for each person was happy to have a place to live.
If you have more time to stay in Trinidad than a single afternoon, it is worth knowing interesting places in the nearby surroundings such as Ancon Beach or the valley of sugar mills.
The night belongs to the House of Music, which animates with its music the silence of the mornings.
Baracoa
A small town in the western tip of Cuba, some consider it the most beautiful on the island.
Surely that opinion is already confirmed by the way.
The two roads that arrive there from Guantanamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as through a nature that hardly knows the action of man.
This eastern place of Cuba has been inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site thanks to its untouched nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Columbus (in fact it is a cross that arrived 100 years later from the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was and that there is now a hotel with the same name, you can see the mountains and among them the best known, the Yunque.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Pines, the Cabaret Tropicana, the patroness of Cuba, the Virgin of Charity of Copper, the Santería, an African religion practiced by the descendants of those slaves, all of this could be filled many pages.
However, as they say, it’s better to see it sometime.
Allies are passive in Afghanistan, Americans say
Few soldiers and insufficient necessary equipment are influencing the progress of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to US Defense Minister Robert Gates, should devise a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not performing as expected, agreed in Edinburgh (Scotland) the representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country.
As conflicts with the Taliban grow today, the eight participating states are discussing the plans and coordination of the Allies.
While the United States this week through its defense minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to increase activity, Britain sees it as a priority to strengthen the authority of the Afghan government and the distribution of development aid.
“Development in Afghanistan is palpable but the armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The next is to enable the population to start economic and security development on their own,” Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan rebels is higher than in the last five years.
The number of violent actions grew compared to last year by 27 percent, and in Helmand province by up to 60 percent.
NATO countries have around 40,000 troops in Afghanistan of which a quarter are in the south of the territory.
However, for the United States, the allies have reached the same limit in terms of the organization and equipment of the units.
They are asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
“We will have to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and how we will achieve them,” Gates said.
NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop also spoke today.
“I’m not happy to know what we have on earth and sky in Afghanistan.
We have ninety percent of the troops and equipment we would need, and that’s little,” De Hoop told Reuters at the close of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the assisting countries in recent months there has been controversy as to whether all allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticized for being passive.
“The Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in an area of minimal violence and the demands of struggle there are not as high as ours, in the southern and eastern part of the country,” Gates said.
The sensationalist Sun newspaper this week called the German soldiers vacant.
"The Afghan rebels discover that the Germans are playing while our boys are fighting," Sun wrote in a footage accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild responded to the attack and posted a photograph where the British troops played a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State Debt Will Reach 1 Billion in 2009
For every Czech, the state owes 84,000 kronor.
Total debt in September amounted to 847.7 billion kronor.
This year the government planned to lend 159.2 billion kronor.
However, at the beginning of December the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion kronor thanks to the improvement in the evolution of the economy of the state budget.
The state debt of the Czech Republic grew at the end of September to 842.7 billion kronor.
In nine months this year it increased by 40.2 billion kronor.
Since June, however, 13.4 billion kronor has declined.
So today, the Ministry of Economy confirmed its data on the state debt of early October.
For every Czech, the debt corresponds to 84,000 crowns.
For the whole of last year, the state was indebted to more than 111 million kronor.
“For now, it seems that thanks to next year’s low deficit we could cross the billion-crown border until 2009.
Next year the debt should move between the 900 billion and the trillion kronor,” David Marek, economist at Patria Finance, told iHNed.cz.
Next Finance economist Vladimír Pikora: “We could pass the trillion in 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget we don’t know yet.
If the situation on the political scene were to change and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed to the year 2010.
But I don’t see that change,” he added.
Doubt grows
The debt of the state creates debts in the central government and arises, above all, from the accumulation of the deficit of the state budget.
State debt is paid through treasury bonds, government bonds, direct loans or for example loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state’s domestic debt grew this year from 38.5 billion kroner to 719.4 billion kroner.
Foreign debt has so far grown from 1.7 billion kronor to 123.3 billion kronor.
The so-called negotiable state debt at the end of September contained 803.3 billion z-crowns since June, which was reduced by 13.7 billion.
The average maturity of state debt increased by 6.5 years.
“Total year-on-year debt from the first to the third quarter creates 13 percent which is huge given how the economy works.
It is interesting that growth is generated mainly from bonds where there is a growth of 20%.
It is bad that the debt grows but on the other hand it shows that it is going to be negotiated until there is a pension reform,” Pikora said.
Better than expected
From the state’s debt management and payments strategy for 2007 it is drawn that the government planned this year to lend 159.2 billion kronor.
At the beginning of December, the ministry lowered the plan by 152.8 billion kronor thanks to the improvement in the evolution of the state budget.
The amount is composed, above all, of the deficit of the state budget that this year will be 76 million kronor instead of the expected 91.3 billion kronor.
The rest is made up of maximum planned resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency with some 13.3 billion kronor, the reserve of 10 billion kronor for the payment of pensions, 43 billion kronor to finance the state’s obligations and 1.8 billion kronor in payments from the European Investment Bank’s loans.
He was comparing Jartum today in front of a court for giving a name to a teddy bear.
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced Thursday afternoon by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and expulsion, her lawyer said.
The Britannica was accused of letting 6- to 7-year-old pupils give the name Mohammed to a teddy bear when any depiction of the prophet of Islam is unlawful.
He was punished by a scourge.
This 54-year-old British schoolteacher from the Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested Sunday at her home and charged with attacking Islam and sedition, under article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, as a result of several complaints from parents of pupils before the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to September, when this teacher asks her 6/7-year-old students to choose a name for the classroom teddy bear.
“Eight names come out of children’s mouths, like Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” says school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a class vote, 20 out of 23 children have chosen Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children made a book for the class with the photo of the bear with the following caption “My name is Mohamed”.
The bear himself wore no label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the depiction of the prophet considered as an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons’ Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and that he would never have done anything that might be insulting to a religious faith, “I’m sorry only that I asked the children to vote for a name,” which he said was only an “innocent mistake.”
Opinion divided by numerous schoolteacher pupils who describe her as "very attentive to her pupils" and "who never talks about religion in class".
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most commonly given name in Britain, written in English with 14 different modes.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can we give it to a toy?
It is, of course, a matter of interpretation.
They did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday, during the last session of negotiations in Vienna.
In the end, the failure.
Kosovo Serbs and Albanians finished a sixth and final session of discussions in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning without having been able to overcome their differences over the future status of the separatist province.
“It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status,” said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was “at stake,” his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of negotiations.
“We do not foresee violence for now but we are entering a very difficult period,” he added, noting that “obvious tensions exist.”
End of mediation on December 10
The mediators of the troika, which regroups the European Union, the United States and Russia, will go one last time on Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the 90% Albanian-populated province could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko return their relationship to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final session of negotiations since the troika was tasked with further mediation by the UN last August.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation to end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked in the Security Council the granting of independence in Kosovo, insist on a continuation of the negotiations beyond this deadline.
“Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution,” Botsane-Khartchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of Kosovo’s UN administration, Westerners consider independence under European Union supervision to be the only viable solution.
Pristina feels ready to unilaterally proclaim it if the Security Council does not resolve in its favor.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
“Unfortunately, no agreement has been found,” said the president of Kosovo’s autonomous authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the hotel in Baden where these “last opportunity negotiations” were held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, the former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, has given part of his sorrows.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade “belonged to a past that has led to homicides and deportations.”
" Domino Effect "
Serbian President Boris Tadic has considered that a compromise was always feasible, warning the Kosovo Albanian majority against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province’s independence.
Belgrade says it particularly fears a "dominant effect" in a region still weakened by the independence wars of the 1990s.
“For Serbia, this doesn’t mean a compromise is impossible.”
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision should belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has a veto.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word"
"Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
"These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they started: in the Security Council.”
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that "the Kosovo Parliament will have the final say on the status", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence on the part of Albanians would be made "in consultation" with the Westerners.
Bush launches Israeli-Palestinian deal
President George Bush announced, during the opening of the international peace conference he convened Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately enter into negotiations to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised he would do everything to help them conclude a “peace treaty” by the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must dismantle “terrorist infrastructure” and Israel must end its colonization activities, Bush said, recalling both sides’ obligations to the peace itinerary they agreed to in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would attempt “to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including core issues.”
This designation covers the three main troubled issues of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the American president, Abbas insisted that the upcoming negotiations be “global and thorough” and refer to all aspects of a regulation, citing “Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things.”
Climbing back on the rostrum, Olmert pledged to make the forthcoming negotiations “direct and continuous” and to make “an effort to conclude them in the course of 2008.”
In late 2008, Bush set the end of the implementation of his coexisting Palestinian and Israeli “two-state vision.”
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had made a commitment to this on the part of Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, that proposes to Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks “a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, more particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects,” Prince Saud estimates in his Arabic newspaper interview with Saudi capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
Just like every time in these kinds of events, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation by the General Inspectorate of the French National Police (IGPN), a police car was driving on Sunday, shortly after 17:00 Luisa-Miguel Street, in Villiers-le-Bel.
“I was not in intervention but on patrol, and I was circulating at 40-50 km/h, without a rotating headlight,” a police source explains.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, "unapproved, i.e. not authorized to drive on public roads" (see below) and driven by two youths without helmets, circulated "all-gas".
"He hit the police car on the left side, after a breach of the pass gives way to the right," the police said.
Alcohol control practiced on vehicle occupants turned out to be negative.
The state of the car (the front collapsed, windshield cracked, bumpers ripped off) testifies to the violence of the crash.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that she had entrusted an investigation for "acts of involuntary homicide and denial of assistance" to the IGPN, co-hosted with the departmental directorate of public security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor specified that the investigation of the IGPN, at this stadium, ruled out the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate three witnesses of the accident, understood on Sunday afternoon, confirmed "the version of the police officers, knowing that this minimotocycle came relatively quickly to his left".
Yesterday, a type of slot, no doubt caused by rubbing the footwear on the ground, showed that both vehicles had been stuck in time for the police car to brake.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of both victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after?
Yesterday, a rumor circulated quickly in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the policemen would have left the site very quickly, thus not providing relief to both young men.
The IGPN, being cautious, would also remove "any serious fault" concerning this point.
"It's the most difficult aspect of the investigation, which needs more investigation, which you have to be very careful about," a police source said.
Liberation found an eyewitness of these few moments that have followed the accident.
One of the windows that leads to the scene.
“We went downstairs, with my cousin who is a nurse to the hospital, to try to revive them,” said the witness.
There was nothing to do.”
Then he saw "a completely frightened policeman, who lamely.
Two others were trying to revive one of the young men, the fourth was talking on the phone.”
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, with the certainty that the people present of the unexpected situation of the young people, the policemen have been taken by car by colleagues who had arrived at the site.
According to this witness, rescues arrived “about twenty minutes after the police marched.”
They also practiced cardiac massages, in vain.
"I will not let it be assumed that the police did not bring assistance to the young people.
These young people have been rescued.
Firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything has been done to try to save them,” the prosecutor said.
Tensions rise in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday cracked down on the first demonstrations since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the eastern city of Lahore, nearly 2,000 lawyers protesting measures taken under the state of emergency have been injured by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement, according to witnesses.
The latter replicated with stones, injuring police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been arrested.
Scenes similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police charged and wounded lawyers.
Many would have been questioned.
In Islamabad, lawyers for the Supreme Court called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of about 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
Streets that gave access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the grouping.
Other demonstrations reportedly took place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers’ movement on Monday picked up support from religious parties regrouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president “urged the population to send flowers to the judges who spoke out against the state of emergency and the waste they swore an oath to in front of Musharraf.”
" The promise of Musharraf no longer fulfills "
The Pakistani Supreme Court refers directly to the measure of exception proclaimed on Saturday afternoon.
He had to pronounce in the coming days on the legality of President Musharraf’s re-election to the presidential election on October 6 to the indirect suffrage.
Court President Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry has been eliminated and replaced.
“Everything we witness is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to Supreme Court rulings,” the magistrate told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army and become a civilian president "no longer values" after the establishment of the state of emergency, Assistant Information Minister Tariq Azeem said Monday.
He was expected to leave his military uniform by November 15, the end of his first presidential term.
The Assistant Information Minister also confirmed that the January elections could be moved.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government denied insistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf had been assigned to residency by his deputy army chief.
More than a third of pregnancies remain unforeseen.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unexpected births.
Even today, more than one in three (36%) pregnancies is not expected, according to a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), 40 years after the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unexpected births.
Different methods of contraception such as pill or sterilizer still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, Ined estimates.
The liberalization of contraception, however, allowed for a better "control of fertility", according to the institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 years has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
At last, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
Even calculated a little more or less a month for a couple in five and if possible for spring, season judged as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It will have taken astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates from the International Space Station (ISS) more than seven hours to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel that is indispensable for the continuation of the station’s scientific activities.
A risky departure that amassed records because of its duration, its distance from the habitable modules, the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments "capuchée" by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday when astronauts had released the Harmony module from the Discovery shuttle, a cylindrical thick piece in charge of soon hosting European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see boxed).
This module is a type of landing platform for the modules-laboratories.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to displace an electricity production module with solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present on the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After displacing it, the crew began the reorganization of the module’s solar panels that have a wingspan of 76 meters.
And that’s where one of the panels, which unfold like accordions, has been damaged in just over a meter by a wire that was jammed.
The deployment has been stopped so as not to further damage the panel.
The astronauts, who had at first to make a control exit from the Discovery shuttle, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it is Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go snailing at the end of the 30 meters long remote arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to carry out the repair.
He is one of NASA’s best spacewalkers.
High, sturdy, very skillful, has a very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this trained doctor has been tasked with "operating" the "wounded" solar panel.
After having precisely inspected the damage, he sectioned the fallible cable and installed types of "tablets" in the damaged area.
He had been helped by the second "spacewalker" who had stayed close to the air lock and, inside, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick wrapped with insulator to prevent electrocution in the solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been conceived and hooded by the astronauts on board the station.
Once the operation was complete, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before inventorying his instruments and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts took advantage of a midday break before today, seven astronauts return from the Discovery shuttle for the return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned on the stock exchange
The EADS stock is currently in sharp decline on the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautical and defense group announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to cope with the delays of the A400M.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been forced to revise its forecast of the operational result for 2007 in response to delays generated by the slow progression of the A400M engine development, which conditions the inaugural flight of the aircraft.
The cost to mitigate the delay in delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, amounts to “between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros of which more than 1 billion euros for Airbus,” announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
Due to these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new operating income targets (EBIT) for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, it adds without any more cipher accuracy.
The group also indicates that the estimate of the new loads is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be remembered that the operational result of EADS failed by 86% in 2006, mainly due to charges linked to the delays of another program, that of the very thick carrier A380.
Initially, the group was planning a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
No surprises on Sunday at the exit of the ballot box: the Russians will massively opt for President Putin’s party, united Russia.
Confirming his aspiration for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days before the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends voters a televised message about public broadcasters, already recorded but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as the leader of the list for United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory proves overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president left nothing to be transparent by welcoming foreign ambassadors, content to deliver a new charge against the West accused of meddling - its subject of predilection during the campaign.
“We know the price of a true democracy and we want fair, more transparent and more open elections, elections without incident,” he added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
He denounces a campaign tainted by pressure.
Communist leader Gennadi Zyuganov says there is “never had such dirty elections, even in the time of Yeltsin.”
After last weekend’s crackdown on demonstrations, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, is banned from visiting, according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the Soviet homo mentality"
Behind these unsurprising legislative elections lie two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, on March 2, 2008; candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot apply for the third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful united Russia party that would elect the government and the president?
Whatever it is, in legislative and presidential elections, outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the Soviet homo, they do not feel master of their destiny," says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University goes back further: civil society lags behind in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, “Putin re-established the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population since this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic ease,” estimates Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians "willingly renounce the personal responsibility" of those who had briefly proved themselves after the outbreak of the USSR.
"Why reflect?"
The phenomenon affects all social layers, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite plans to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of united Russia.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion prefers stability.
In the name of that the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Tamara Cherednitchenko, 54-year-old teacher: "Why reflect?
“Those in power are not too bad, why change them?”
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Bad Arolsen Nazi archives, which describe the fate of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are freely accessible.
The 47 million archival documents, stored over 27 km of shelves in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were hitherto not available only for a “humanitarian” purpose, i.e. individually and nominatively, at the request of a former victim or his rightful persons.
The eleven states in charge of its management – such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States – agreed in May 2006 to open them up to seekers and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
Historians’ access to Bad Arolsen will allow for research “particularly on the displacements of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health status of the forced laborers,” explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, such as Germany, objected to the openness to the public of these nominative documents, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as the alleged homosexuality or mental handicap of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or detention orders established by the Gestapo had been gathered after the war for a practical purpose: to find the peasants deported or subjected to compulsory work and, eventually, to provide them with proof of their internment, in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees process tens of thousands of individual petitions.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
“There is nothing fundamentally new to be expected from these documents,” said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for Research on Antisemitism at the Technische Universität Berlin in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches about 60 billion euros per year.
The European Union is India’s largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
The European Union’s foreign ministers had last April given their approval to the European Commission to start negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The European Union is India’s largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trading partner of the European Union, according to figures from the European Commission.
“A free trade pact will doubly boost both economies” and “India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans,” Peter Mandelson said.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, said the European Commissioner. The Asian and European giants exchange annually for " 47 billion euros of goods " and for " ten billion euros of services ", had declared this week Danièle Smadja, head of the delegation of the European Commission in New Delhi, feeling that the bilateral trade of the European Union " has not yet reached its potential.

Bank of England Takes Note of Concerns Offering 10 Billion Pounds in Five Weeks
England’s bank on Thursday was concerned about easing the current return of concerns over credit conditions, and announced a ten-billion-pound bid at the 5.75% base index in five weeks, an unusually long bid.
“To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its expected reserve contribution during the holding period beginning Dec. 6 in the form of an open market operation for five weeks,” the statement said.
The bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put on the market on December 6 at 12:15 GMT, at the base index and until January 10.
It is the first time it seems that the England Bank BoE puts liquidity on the market for five weeks in an open market trade.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE adds in its statement that it is “prepared to take other steps to keep the rates” of interbank lending up to date in line with its base index.
The daily interbank index was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The index after three months was set at 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the start of the summer financial crisis, the sums put on the market by the Bank of England were combined with a significant penalty rate that had deterred banks from resorting to that.
According to some rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the pound exchange rate relative to the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums brought to the market by the European Central Bank, to the most advantageous indices and with a more assured discretion.
The UMP and NC parties deny the examination of the PS party’s proposals on purchasing power
The UMP group and Nouveau Centre refused on Thursday to discuss articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist "niche" (session for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the national office of the PS including the increase of 50% of the bonus for employment, the re-establishment of the TIPP (domestic rate for petroleum products) floating, a check-transportation or the restrictions of rents.
Since UMP and NC have voted against the review of the articles (180 votes to 115), the session has been lifted at the end of the general discussion that resulted in exchanges, sometimes live, between majority and opposition to a few hours of the televised intervention of Nicolas Sarkozy on purchasing power.
PS MP leader Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of its proposals in the form of amendments to the amending finance bill reviewed by the Assembly next week.
A new festival comes to light
As a result of numerous rumors regarding the creation by C3 Presents of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
“For our company, it’s an honor to work with a person who inspired, no more and no less, the current festival movement in America,” C3’s Charlie Jones told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival would take place Aug. 8-10 on a private 500-acre farm approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Festival Republic director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took over the direction of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which annually attracts some 80,000 people.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio then, in 2006, the Republic Festival created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been in charge of the production, licensing and organisational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury a “most inspiring event” he’s ever attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says his company and Melvin Benn’s are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
“We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked perseveringly with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
“We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
“Unfortunately, we are stuck in low-level policies because of the current administration,” Charlie Jones chases.
“Fortunately, we were able to argue with Melvin Benn and prepared to create a magnificent festival in an exceptional venue that, lately, has been taking place in Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza Festival in 2005 at Grant Park in Chicago, after being unmarked in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded respective gross revenues of $9.8 million and $11.3 million in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a country festival, while ours are performed rather in urban green areas,” says Charlie Jones.
The goal is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give at once a rural festival impression in the European and urban way in the American way.
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the celebration of this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the deal, but claims "that they are interesting enough to allow for investing in such an event and hosting a festival that we hope will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the festival’s hotel offering is “very big,” like the 80,000-strong Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says invitations have been thrown to the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed at the time of going under press.
“Vineland will taste like rock, but the music will be varied there, hoping to attract all kinds of viewers,” says Charlie Jones.
His C3 teammates, who received the Top Independent Promoter award from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal:
Montreal faces Terminator
It’s not easy to attract Hollywood movie dishes to Montreal when nothing but Terminator opposes that...
This seduction mission is part of the delegate functions.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces "runaway productions".
Is it hard to compete with the Governor?
“You have to be cautious, it’s the industry that decides where it goes.
If you find that conditions in Montreal are favorable, you’re going to go there.
Our role is to offer those who will judge the best,” he says.
The Race to Festivals
At the moment, Denis Turcotte’s priority is nevertheless the promotion of cinema from here.
The race for the Oskars has begun.
Every festival on the West Coast, whether it’s Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present the Quebec films, give them value and make sure the filmmakers do interviews.
The Age of Darkness had a good image at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on board at Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films to the American Film Institute Fest this month.
There will be a year-end rally on the stock market? The experts, divided by the subprime crisis.
With less than five weeks to lay off the year, investors are already rubbing their hands waiting for the traditional year-end rally to arrive.
However, this year the experts are not so clear that this is going to happen.
Banif believes that "statistically, December on the stock exchange usually performs positively.
However, forecasts should not be made solely on the basis of statistics, especially since in the current context, uncertainties lurk in the markets, at least in the short term.
Although they are not in favor of the stock market picking up the lattice in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is supported by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of flight towards quality values both in the long and short sections".
For this reason, they believe that the stock exchange will have a rather lateral behavior, not exempt from volatility “especially because the impact of the likely decline in the Fed’s rates is not known, given the high level of crude and the danger of stimulus from inflationary tensions.”
Javier Barrio, head of BPI sales in Spain, agrees that this is not a good time to venture to say that there will be rally.
“There’s not a lot of joy in it,” says the expert.
The Ibex has lost about 4% from the highs on November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Not all experts have this negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close closer to 16,000 points this year thanks to the restructuring of portfolios and the traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year at these dates.
However, the expert nuances that things will be somewhat different this year as he believes that the rally will be ahead of the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitution.
The analyst does not believe that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, estimates that we are close to technical levels and "therefore we could see a rebound in the index that could be boosted depending on the news coming from the US in terms of the consequences of the crisis in the credit market".
The analysts are confident that they are positive.
Analysts agree when it comes to choosing the stocks that will be in charge of taking the Ibex to new highs.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that “this year is about big values.”
The expert would include in the portfolio the two big banks and some builders "because when the date comes, the electric sector will be very expensive."
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco assures that the increases will come from the hand of the banking and industrial sector.
The builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, in case they happen.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we expect other manufacturers like Ferrovial and FCC to follow their own path," he said.
Cyclic consumption will be the protagonist in the latter part of the year due to the increase in sales in the holiday sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technological ones will also do very well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, only twice December has been a bearish month.
The real rally at the end of the year was in 2003, an exercise in which the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the puncture of the technological bubble.
This year, in which the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December recorded a 6.68% pickup.
It will have to be seen if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of gains (at the moment the Ibex is up 8.36% since January) and if it manages to have its rally at the end of the year.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
Popular has decided to renovate much of its offices.
In total 200, the ones located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, as it is the first group that decides to take the leap to bet on the uninterrupted opening of their agencies until 8.30 pm, and open on Saturdays from 10 am to 8.30 pm.
Another group that has also reiterated on several occasions that it wanted to extend the schedules of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, it is about to strike a deal with unions to close 75% of its offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening one afternoon, though not to the public.
The results of the experience of Popular will be decisive for other entities to sign up or not to this initiative that follows the schedules of the shops.
This is precisely the goal that Popular pursues with the project.
Capture private customers who move through these areas to make their purchases, to SMEs, freelancers and shops of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open throughout Spain in about 18 months, as they are not new openings but remodeling the existing ones.
To do this, the entity will modernize the branches it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile presented by customers of the different streets.
In this way, the expansion of the schedules is accompanied by a different conception of the branch space and a new design, more current, with brighter colors.
The head of commercial banking, Ángel Rivera, says that this restructuring is not a big investment, although it is a greater hiring of personnel, since it goes from having about six employees per premises to eight or nine.
The offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, Ángel Rivero explains.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía de Madrid have been chosen, and it seems to be right, according to Rivero.
Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 that operate under the brand Mundocredit, specialized in immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these premises of PopularMax will not repeat the model of BBVA, where several of its offices have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our customers,” Rivero says.
For now, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with personnel outside the bank.
Telecinco doubles its rival Antena 3 stock market value for the first time
We've made it.
With that phrase he expressed his satisfaction yesterday Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, at the closing of the market, when he found that the chain he runs doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect tarnished his joy: “It’s what hurts me, not because we’ve grown more, but because we’ve fallen less,” he said.
Still, he stressed that in a weak market, “we’ve fallen less.”
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with an advance of 2.54%.
That gain puts its loss in what we have for the year at 15.66%.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and owned by Vocento (another 13%) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antena 3, which fell 1.52% yesterday and accumulates a drop of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communication companies amounts to 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million Prisa (Cinco Días publisher) and 1.779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is because 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we make it profitable in terms of audience.”
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first television network this year to exceed 1 billion gross advertising revenues, according to Giuseppe Tingali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the group's advertising.
If this data is true, the television channel would register this year an increase of 3.6% in its advertising revenue compared to 965.4 million in the 2006 fiscal year.
For its part, Antena 3’s net turnover increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (to 734.4 million), while net television revenue grew by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point out for the best relative evolution on the Telecinco Stock Exchange is the high payout it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile says that, although it is early to make the decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol in association with its Mediaset parent company.
“We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always stated much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, which we have already valued with 33% of Endemol.
According to analysts, the market is showing some fatigue at the moment.
Lehman Brothers recently lowered its profit estimates over Telecinco in 2008 by 4% and in 2009 by 7%.
It is due, they explain, to the fact that it has cut the expected revenue growth from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This same firm has lowered Antena 3’s profit forecast by 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force November 1
In parallel to its parliamentary procedure, which ended today with the Congressional vote on the amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the government has submitted to a public hearing the regulations that will develop the new law, with the aim of both coming into force before the end of the year.
Representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the effort made by deputies and senators to negotiate and consensualize the best regulations in order to ensure the protection of investors and regulate in detail the activity of the entities so that the markets function efficiently.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Markets Act, involves the modernization of financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and fostering cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new rules will allow the provision of financial advisory services to specialized firms as well as to natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial services firms (ESIS), financial advisory firms (AFIs), which join stock companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the execution of trades in financial instruments, so that regulated secondary markets are added to the multilateral trading systems and order internalization systems, which will compete with the current stock exchange managers.
The law also requires investment services firms to disclose in the market information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management forms and requires them to keep a record of all the operations they carry out, to facilitate supervision by the CNMV.
In its passage through the Congressional Economic Commission, several modifications were incorporated, among which it highlights that the securitised debts are considered as a "complex" financial instrument given their high danger to the investor, which has been demonstrated with what happened with the debt of US high-risk mortgages (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally delimit the functions that graduates in Economics and Business can perform 30 years after the adoption in 1977 of the royal decree delimiting the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work on behalf of others, will not require authorization from the CNMV and will be able to provide its services of product marketing and customer acquisition to different investment companies at the same time.
Harmonized CPI increases five-tenths in November to 4.1%
This indicator, which then serves Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation index in the European Union, provides an advance on how prices evolved in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the one employed for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, so it does not necessarily have to coincide with the definitive data, which will be released next December 14.
“The CPI will continue to be at relatively high levels.”
Second Vice President and Economy Minister Pedro Solbes has said the 4.1% rise in the CPI in November is a “temporary figure”, but at the same time has predicted that the price index will continue at “relatively high” levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes has pointed out in the halls of Congress that "although the figure is not good" the inflation differential of Spain with respect to the monetary union remains "more or less" the same in recent years.
He also explained that in November “there was less surprise” than in the previous month, when the government did not have such a high rise.
“We expected a figure of around 4%,” the economy minister acknowledged with respect to the figure advanced today.
Virgin plans to raise €42 billion with Northern Rock in three years
Northern Rock’s deposits have fallen more than 50% to 12 billion pounds since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At the time, it was amassing record deposits of over 25 billion pounds, a figure that has fallen progressively in two and a half months due to the mistrust of its customers and despite the one hundred percent guarantee of the money offered by the government and that it will keep until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rebrand the entity with its financial trademark Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the revenue from British banks that deposit over the next three years to achieve the remaining 18 billion pounds to reach the 30 billion target.
Magnate Richard Branson’s group, known for its eye-catching advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) annually on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock named the Virgin consortium’s offer, which three other companies are involved in, this week as its favorite to bail out it from bankruptcy.
The mayor of Totana arrested for alleged urban corruption plot
The Civil Guard arrested the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (Popular Party) early this morning for his alleged relationship to the urban corruption plot uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the consistory and the police chief of the municipality have also been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced last May Juan Morales, current popular deputy, and until then councillor of the municipality, and that according to sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Chain, could be the 'head' of this plot.
The agents continue to register the municipal units and the city council and no more arrests are ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the urban corruption plot uncovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As the SER chain reported yesterday, the lawyer of the 'popular' deputy Juan Morales, therefore outcast, was arrested leaving the home of Morales with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the object of the investigation, according to sources of the investigation, is the alleged collection of commissions from Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban planning agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, eight people have been arrested.
Bono agrees to lead the candidacy of the PSOE for Toledo and preside over the Congress if they win the elections.
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the list of the PSOE by Toledo for the next general elections and to be president of Congress in the event that the Socialists win the general elections.
This was announced in a press conference by the Secretary of Organization of the PSOE, José Blanco, and Bono himself, after the meeting held this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The head of the executive has justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he has pointed out that “yes it seems” that the politician from the Manchego will be the candidate of the socialist group to preside over the Congress if the socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marin as president of Congress, who on November 15 made public his decision not to run for the next general election and to abandon his career in active politics to dedicate himself to fighting climate change in the university field.
The former minister has acknowledged that the president of the government has not stopped urging her to return to the political vanguard since she left it two years ago.
In addition, he has pointed out that, just as citizens know who will be the economic vice president if the PSOE wins the elections, his party has wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he takes office, Bono hopes to turn the House into “the house of respect and not of insult or screaming” and make it “more and more like the citizens.”
"Sometimes unfortunately it seems that the only place in Madrid where you can't talk quietly and quietly is the Congress, the president of the government was once interrupted in the Senate 26 times."
He has also had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marin and "his good deed" and has not wanted to be already occupying his position so as not to fall into what, as he pointed out, his opponents could see as "prepotency".
Climate Propaganda
Since the anti-climate movement is mercilessly persecuting both the skeptics of its predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles, it is bound to show iron coherence.
And more a leader of the movement who is president of the government as Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even proposes to sign a "new contract with the planet".
That approach forces him to explain why his government’s action, or inaction, has contributed decisively to Spain leading the EU in breach of Kyoto.
Who is responsible for the non-compliance, in what sectors it has occurred and why his government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it requires you to explain to the Spaniards as clearly as possible what measures you will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizen habits will need to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be forced to make, what economic consequences will it have.
In other words, who will sacrifice and who will pay to save the planet?
But there has not been or will be such explanations.
Precisely because it is about sacrificing and paying.
The measures against climate change, the real measures, are unpopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Even the cent of the gasoline suggested by the PSOE has seemed so electorally dangerous to Zapatero that he hastened to deny it.
That is, it is about saving the planet with nothingness, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With shocking phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new charges.
With contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for electoral campaigns that he neither speaks nor denounces nor demands, but adorns the rallies and inspires tenderness.
As long as you are merely a virtual contracting party and don’t want us to ride a bike or cool off with the fan.
The mayor and the head of the local police of Totana are arrested for an alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the City Council and a hotelier for possible urban crimes, sources of the investigation have reported today.
The mayor was arrested at his home and has been transferred to the Consistory, in whose offices he is currently with numerous agents, who have also attended the Department of Urban Planning and the municipal company of management of Industrial Soil and Housing.
These three arrests add to the six made last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of rustic land in urbanizable for the Galician company Nuaria to build 4,000 homes, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other people were not arrested but are charged in the summary, which instructs the Court No. 1 of Totana.
The first six detainees have now been brought to justice.
According to the sources, the former governor of Totana and today regional parliamentarian of the PP, Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, the former woman, owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been charged, as has the current girlfriend of the former councillor, who resides in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of Grupo Nuaria, the lawyer and businessman from Vigo, Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as was Pablo José M.G., director of Solo de Inmonuar, an agency integrated into the aforementioned Group, through which bribes would have been made.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guard, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, practiced eleven records, most of them in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
Only one person was then arrested in Totana, namely the owner of a poultry company well known in the region, who could have acted as an intermediary.
Grupo Nuaria was in charge of developing what would be the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired in Totana 2.2 million square meters of land that were requalified and its project would double the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the car parks in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and in the Plaza de Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; It recommends, focusing on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with this commentary yesterday in Finland’s most important newspaper (by the way, at the head of the PISA report on education in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that there appeared, curiously, the criticism of Blackburn’s book:
"The content of the Philosophy signature has leapt to public opinion as a result of the tragedy of Jokela's school.
The culprit of the deaths, a high school student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Councilor in charge of the Philosophy subject, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and stated that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in the institutes.

A colleague gives information on the introduction of crimes related to Internet downloads into the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be a crime with a penalty of six months to a year.
On the other hand, if you steal in the store discs worth less than 400 euros, it is considered simply missing (article 623.1).
B. If you steal up to 1,000 euros in the store, the theft is already a crime, but the penalty is still lower than the one imposed on the download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is still lower than that of the unloading (article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the compact exchange.
Participating in a tumultuous feud has a penalty of three months to one year (article 154 of the Criminal Code) and the exchange would have a penalty of six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a movie on DVD, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted and unauthorised films by authors is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (article 186).
Anyway, if my colleague is right, someone is going out of hand, a very long hand.

My GP gives me one of his rare research articles titled, ‘Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less.’
That is, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of the workers depends on what the colleagues earn.
The study has been conducted using tomographic magnetic resonance imaging at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Neurocognition Imaging group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: “The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed.”
The researchers observed that if when both hit they received the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one received double, the activation was greater.
I don’t know if I needed that much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing war criminals from the Balkans from the prosecution office of the Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a bittersweet taste, because the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre – in which 8,000 Muslim Bosniaks were killed – former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on that list, from which takes its title the documentary of the Swiss filmmaker Marcel Schüpbach, ‘La lista de Carla’ (2006, not released in Spain) which, with the rhythm of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to pursue the escaped criminals and pressure the governments involved to tighten the siege.
What insurance is right for me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in case of possible accidents, represents a significant expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, age of the card, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use of it, among others.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the right model.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment is embodied in an insurance contract, which stipulates that the company receives the amount of the agreed premium in exchange for being held liable for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a claim.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, age of the card, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use given to it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so that the higher the likelihood of an accident, the higher the fee to pay.
That’s why both women and over 25s have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show they have a lower accident rate because of their prudence.
Also, taking advantage of the counts, companies have come to the conclusion that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use given to the vehicle will influence the frequency, and with it the likelihood of having some kind of accident.
Increasing the frequency increases the odds.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
Therefore, the driver must study the situation well to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
We will expose here the most significant variables when choosing one or another type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, offers a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 are faced with various drawbacks when it comes to hiring insurance at an affordable price, such as reduced driving experience and the age of the card.
Although the ideal way to be well insured is full-risk insurance, there are other, more economical options.
More cautious drivers can opt for a full-risk franchise, so they get full-risk insurance coverage but at a more feasible price.
This kind of agreement would require the customer to pay a portion of the amount of the claim.
“The part of the amount of the claim that the customer contributes will be preset based on the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount,” says Luis Noguera, head of First Europe in Spain, an online insurance broker.
Another option is extended third party insurance, so that the customer ensures protection against damage caused to third parties, although not to those caused in their own car.
In addition, it would be covered by theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
One piece of advice.
If you are under 25 years old try to be careful and avoid claims as much as possible, as this will have an impact on the bonus, being able to reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the base rate that the company owns.
On the contrary, a penalty is a surcharge on that base rate.
“Bonus and penalties will depend on the company and the company’s benefit.
If the company has had a good year, it can afford to increase the bonuses,” Noguera explains.
After the age of 25, drivers have it easier when it comes to insurance, since the accident rate is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, it is best to hire an all-risk franchise.
“Normally young people cannot make use of the experience previously acquired when using themselves in an accident, and even when driving,” says the director in Spain of the European company, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, once the ‘novice fear’ has passed.
However, if the client is married but still has no children, it is preferable that he negotiates full-risk insurance, as long as his financial situation allows it, of course.
For their part, marriages with children are considered by insurers as the public with the lowest accident rate, so the surcharges will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be one with a deductible (may be 300 euros), or, when a high level of bonus is available, one to third parties extended from the third year of life of the vehicle.
“They drive more relaxed and have greater purchasing power to afford to take on a larger amount of franchise,” says Luis Noguera.
For retirees it is advisable to have a full-risk insurance with franchise (being this one of 150 euros), or one extended to third parties when you have a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is important, not only because it covers the driver in case of possible accidents, but also because it represents a significant expense, which is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that best suits us according to our personal situation.
Celtic is looking for a point in Milan that is worth the octaves
Milan and Celtic meet on Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point they lack to achieve their respective goals in the closing of the league of the 'Champions', as the Italians serve to be first and the Scots to judge their classification.
The Italians scored ten points and already certified on the fifth day their pass with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to make sure that the Shakhtar, with six, and who receives Benfica, who has four, does not pass him.
These two Group D matches will be played one week before the end of the entire sixth day, as Milan have to play in the Club World Cup in Japan, where they debut on the 13th in the semifinals in search of a place for the final of the 16th.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the draw in Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to come out for a victory, as the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic knows that winning would be first and ensure a better crossing in octaves.
The whole of Gordon Strachan could serve even a defeat to qualify if the Shakhtar does not win, but it can not be trusted because at nine points the pass is for the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanists will try to bitter the night to the Scots, who are confident to enter in eighth for the second time in the restructured Champions League and consecutively, after they were precisely defeated in that round last season with a goal of Kaka in the extension (1-0) after 0-0 of the one-way.
Waiting for the 'rossoneri' victory will be the Shakhtar who is only worth the win, in case he loses the Celtic, both to get into the eighth and to continue in UEFA.
Benfica, despite being last and with no options to continue in the top European competition, could reach third place with a victory, with which UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls have kicked off their first tour since disbanding in 2000 in Vancouver, Canada.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) stated shortly before starting their concert at GM Place in Vancouver that the group's reunion is "brilliant".
About 20,000 people sold out tickets to attend the concert that included a video telling the story of the group that raged in the late 1990s.
The reunion and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album that collects their main hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which in Spain publishes EMI.
The five Spice Girls took to the stage wearing bracelets given to them by the husband of 'Posh Spice', British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the crowd crowding the GM Place, even though Victoria’s nerves had banned him days earlier.
At the start of the show, Victoria Beckham noted that the British star “hasn’t seen our costumes at all, so I’m nervous about what he’s going to think of the show.”
'Sporty Spice', whose departure from the group in 1998 "due to the differences between us" caused the quintet to dissolve two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I made the decision," Chisholm said of the group's meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, “things have been fixed and we all love each other very much.”
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
For starters, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
Upon arrival at the airport, an army of nannies was waiting for them.
Among the five are seven children.
Following the Vancouver concert, the group will perform in California (USA), San Jose (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
They will perform in Madrid on December 23.
New gas fears between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk that it will affect the export of fuel to Western Europe by Russia.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so every rub between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher transit rates.
A previous dispute last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, monopoly gas owner Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money Ukraine had to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom said it would charge Ukraine more, as it pledged to pay an extra 50 percent in 2008 for gas coming from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say Ukraine could pay 40 percent more for Gazprom imports.
“It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important transits for gas during the talks,” Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters.
“Changes in gas prices should not relate to our arguments about transit rates levels [to Western Europe] via Ukraine.”
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a drop in exports to Western Europe, which quickly raised prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the EU’s supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom is supplementing its own gas supply from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations in Central Asia.
NHS 'must test foreign workers'
The Scottish NHS needs to monitor criminal records of employees from outside Europe, a vigilante said.
Auditor General Robert Black’s recommendation came after a foreign doctor was found to be related to the attack on Glasgow airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish NHS has no idea exactly how much foreign staff it has.
However, his report pointed to other checks that are carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The auditor general checked the number of foreign personnel hired outside the European economic area, following the Glasgow airport attacks.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after colliding with a jeep at the gates of the airport terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who performed at the Old Bailey by video conference in October, indicted in connection with the alleged car bombings in Britain.
NHS hopes to carry out pre-employment checks on candidates, to ensure they meet the qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the UK.
Although the Scottish health board uses “Disclosure Scotland” to conduct criminal background checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside of Britain.
The auditor general’s report recommends, among other measures, that the boards should have the guidance of the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with criminal controls in many countries outside of Britain.
“Although we found some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review,” the report says.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that: “Our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available in the number of foreign NHS personnel.”
BMA Scotland President Dr. Peter Terry said it was “very unlikely” that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
“The report suggests that pre-employment checks work at the NHS Scotland but it’s not clear what the added value of the recommendations made is,” he explained.
Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign people, most of them doctors and nurses.
But the auditor general cautioned that the number may be higher, in part because boards have trouble identifying which employees have indefinite residency permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures established by NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being widely complied with.
This includes passport checks, work permits and qualifications checks.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing the policy and pre-employment guide for foreigners in the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: “I had a great interest in this work being carried out in the wake of the Glasgow airport terrorist attack.
He added that the Scottish government, together with the health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in the update of the pre-employment control guidelines for all working groups – including foreigners – what they planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates in film awards
Control, the biographical film about late Joy Division vocalist Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the Best Picture Award.
The trophies were also given to Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was cast as Curtis, for director Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Actress Judi Dench was named Best Actress for the thriller “Notes of a Scandal.”
And Bond star Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for putting a British film on the international stage.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The film – in black and white – featuring soundtracks from The Killers, David Bowie and New Order – was produced with only 3,000 pounds sterling.
But Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known for the iconic cover of U2’s two-award-winning album Joshua Tree, also won – for best director and best debutant director.
Rock music was the center of another award-winning ceremony – like Julien Temple’s film about The Clash vocalist Joe Strummer, it won the award for best documentary.
Viggo Mortensen was awarded the Best Actor Award for his role as a driver for a Russian mob boss in the David Cronenberg film Promises of the East.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hard, received the Richard Jarris Award for his contribution to British cinema.
The fiftieth, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel "The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull".
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award, named after Harris, the star of Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me," he said.
“I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, it's really an honor."
Independent Film Awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 terrorists
Saudi Arabia said it had arrested 208 militants from terrorist cells who were planning an imminent attack on oil facilities, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
State television from the world’s largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning to smuggle missiles.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have mounted a campaign against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants made up of foreign residents was planning an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province, the report said.
Saudi Arabia created a force of 35,000 troops to protect the facilities of Abqaiq, the world’s largest oil plant, after a failed Al-Qaeda attack in 2006.
The report, citing a statement by the Saudi Interior Minister, said 18 of those arrested belonged to a cell led by a “missile launch expert” who has entered the country.
The minister said the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the country.
Another 22 of the detainees were planning the killings of religious leaders and security forces.
The government has warned religious leaders that they must be more active in stopping Saudis traveling to Iraq to join as militants al-Qaeda to fight allied forces and to back the Shiite Muslim government, which is considered a heretic by the more extreme Saudi Sunnis.
Al-Qaeda militants are targeting many religious in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by authorities to support the policies of the ruling royal family.
The militants – recruited by calls from Saudi-born Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden to harass the country’s pro-western government – targeted foreign government-associated residences, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a huge effort by the security forces, from five months of work," the interior minister's spokesman told state television.
Those arrested also included a “media cell” of 16 people in Medina, whose goal was to promote “takfiri thinking” – the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims that supports violence against Muslims considered infidels and apostates.
The arrest includes 32 others accused of providing support and financial support to the militants.
Venus Climate May Give You an Idea of Earth’s Future
Venus may once have been an appropriate place for life, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft in orbit showed the planet more like an Earth twin than had previously been observed.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
The two planets are similar in size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those that made Earth a habitable planet, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and slower solar rotation sent Venus to a very different kind of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to melt lead and is eroded by hurricane winds and lightning storms.
The results from the European Space Agency’s Venus Express, which has studied the planet for a year, provide a snapshot of how Earth could develop catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor, from the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, states: “It is becoming clearer why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, when they are two planets so similar.
“Our new data makes it possible to build a scenario where Venus began as Earth, possibly with a habitable environment millions of years ago.”
Police seize "enriched uranium"
One kilo of radioactive material, which they claim is enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm whether it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for $1 million.
It is still open
Mitt Romney says it's unworthy of presidential candidates to answer a snow monkey's questions.
However, Republican presidential candidates eventually agree to hold a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters record questions on video and submit them for dissemination among candidates.
None of the questions put on Wednesday afternoon were more ridiculous than the snow monkey that asked Democrats about climate warming in the YouTube Republican party debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected much of the Republican party’s status ahead of next year’s election.
It is not known exactly how CNN producers, who co-sponsor the debate, chose YouTube videos to show aspiring candidates.
But the first half-hour of debate, the longest devoted to a single topic, focused on immigration.
The topic is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to turn up the dial when they heard ideas they liked: broadcasters noticed peaks of approval when candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The night’s toughest word exchanges took place between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been a frontrunner in the crucial Iowa and New Hampshire polls.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney’s reputation because he was soft on illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former Massachusetts governor of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
Both responded aggressively when asked if any candidate could support an “amnesty” (allowing illegals to regularize their situation and giving them the chance to obtain citizenship).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, agreed on the issue.
Neither has the word to be nominated, but both remain in the race perhaps because both warned about the issue of immigration before the others.
At least in immigration, and broadly speaking, candidates share views: increased border surveillance, intolerance to illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with fear of China’s toxic toys and other concerns abroad, helps Republicans forget, or minimize, the divides between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate turned uncomfortable when other issues appeared.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported gun control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether immersion in water should be considered torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed in every word of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble toward the position that while the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another person asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all expectations, first in the most recent Iowa poll, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When pressured to respond if Jesus would be in favor, he laughed that Jesus was too smart to be a candidate in the election.
The race is unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee rises in Iowa, coinciding with liberal Ron Paul’s fundraising campaigns, and his heated remarks from Wednesday’s debate.
The two have come out from the bottom, because the two wings of the party did not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, one candidate joined the party early and convincingly with a winning message about America's greatness, satisfying both party wings.
This time the match is divided and the result is far from clear.
Dolores Laboristas
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole to sink into; but it also emerges
As political scandals continue in England, this one is not particularly interesting.
They do not seem to have sold influences, nor are they exorbitant hotel accounts in Paris, nor extramarital finger sucks.
But it has been revealed that a wealthy businessman has disguised contributions to the British Labour ruling party, of more than 650,000 pounds ($1.3 million), for nearly four years using fake names, and that the party did not denounce him.
Two months ago, when the prime minister evaded calling an election, stupidly insulting British intelligence by declaring that opinion polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that it would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the liberal Democrat leads with increasing ingenuity, because the dreaded Mr. Brown has gone from being Stalin to being Mr. Bean.
The rescue of Northern Rock, a bank in trouble, demonstrated regulatory weakness and poor judgment in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have pitted business groups, together, against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative hoax.
A trio of retired generals started a riot in the House of Lords, protesting the cuts in military spending: to be ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a part-time job.
Now it’s David Abrahams’ multiple donations; Peter Watt, the Labour secretary general (and former accomplice) has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown walks irrevocably towards the exit.
Governments can reach a tipping point after they are unable to govern.
People don’t believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their disbelief when a new batch takes over.
Once it’s clear that the prime minister can’t make things better, that he doesn’t have much time left, that suspension is over: public officials start to fail; cabinet ministers get exposed; the press looks for bad news; and the government gets defensive and doesn’t focus.
In one part, Brown’s position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders he cannot defend himself by arguing that he is new.
Though he wanted to deny Tony Blair, he was his senior lieutenant.
The problems of Northern Rock and the authority registration tax, are related to the decisions Brown made as Chancellor of the Erarium.
And even though it’s not directly involved in the Blairish setbacks – or “partner cash,” research into political party funding – voters can assume it is.
However, Mr. Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
The plates are not as bad as the Tories want to show.
As in Mr. Bean, no one has died, nor been scammed directly.
And the remedy, though painful, is to give what Mr. Brown’s naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his gifts to charitable gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be so, but the decision is not made by him.
The laws against anonymity for big political taxpayers are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who is buying access to those in power.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew Mr. Abraham’s deal was not illegal, will obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, the fundraising chief who was asked about the donations in October.
But Mr. Brown isn’t involved so far: there’s nothing to suggest he knew of these performances, though the bulk of the payments were made after he took control of the office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He has been quick to condemn his party for violating the law, but he dilutes himself in decision-making on a family matter, a commission of inquiry into the matter - led, to a large extent, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it is a matter of the police.
In addition, there are other things Mr. Brown must do, such as finding a permanent and independent head for the Public Life Standards Commission, since he hasn’t had one in six months, and he must also push for genuine party funding reform.
This will require hard cooperative labor with the Tories, and perhaps a renunciation of the special financial situation with the unions – bitter measures for a partisan like Mr. Brown.
But he must face some partisan facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in the polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is to act with impeccable probity and solid competition.
Sharks cards
Is the subprime mortgage crisis infecting the U.S. credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is natural for dorsal fins to swim excited around.
Today, with the American housing market in crisis, predators have their eyes set on the credit card market in the country.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses can reach $99 million if the subprime mortgage crisis infects other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of infection are already seen.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been amortized or that are more than 30 days late respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken 1.4 million in charge of its U.S. consumer financing business, in part due to weakness in card borrowers.
However, it is too early for panic.
Delinquency and crime are at low levels.
According to Moody’s, a rating agency, the third quarter crime rate of 3.89% was almost a percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the U.S. Bankruptcy Act (2005) resulted in a sharp drop in bankruptcy claims, which in turn represent a large loss in credit cards; the number of claims (and therefore, of default) would be growing again, or it could happen that conditions for borrowers were getting worse.
The industry also reports strong payout rates, which show how much of their debts consumers pay each month.
And trust in credit cards and asset-backed securities is pretty firm, despite paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that emission volumes by 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
The direct channels of crisis infection between subprime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers like to charge debts to credit cards now that credit institutions are expiring.
But credit card issuers look more at the flow of liquidity than at active securities, so falling prices don’t necessarily trigger a change in borrowers’ creditworthiness.
They can even work to benefit the issuers.
Incentives for consumers to continue amortizing the mortgage decreases if properties are worth less than the value of the loan; and as a result, the payment of the card debt rises on the priority list.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to the difficult conditions that mortgage lenders face by changing interest rates or altering credit balances.
That in theory should reduce the risk of rapid asset retrenchment.
“We’re not going to wake up one day and reassess all the loans,” says Gary Perlin, head of finance at Capital One.
If a sudden subprime infection in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If home prices are lower and a credit contraction pushes America into recession, the industry undoubtedly faces a tougher future.
We have to keep an eye on those dorsal fins.
British bankers found guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who went on trial for their responsibility in the frauds against Enron’s former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, were found guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent on seven counts of fraud for colliding with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of employees.
They were put on trial in January.
But during the hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each was convicted of fraud collusion.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish PLC group at the Royal Bank, became a notorious cause in Britain for the two-year extradition proceedings.
In the United States, his case marks the sloppy end of an investigation launched after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
Initially, the charges against the bankers were to have alerted Fastow in 2002 that he was the target of a government investigation into Enron’s downfall.
The indictment against the bankers - dubbed the "NatWest Three" - alleges that they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former senior aide, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a Fastow-controlled Enron corporation, which was the architect of a myriad of scams on Enron, which helped its spiral of bankruptcy fall.
In 2002, the bank valued the interests of the subsidiary at zero, but the three Britons knew it would value up.
A company under Kopper’s control bought the subsidiary’s bank interest at $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 in interest on the company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its parts of the subsidiary.
But the $20 million remained in the hands of British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers collected $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted on two counts of conspiracy to collapse Enron.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence at a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a three-year, one-month sentence in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay $1 million they required to live in the United States while the trial was taking place.
Enron, one of the nation’s seven largest companies, declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could not hide the debt of millions or make its failing businesses seem successful.
The collapse caused thousands of jobs to be lost, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were indicted last year for their roles in the company’s collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay’s conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when she died of a heart attack last year.
Not down or out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel capacity to fly directly from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the rich Russians.
“It has capacity for up to 18 passengers,” says Gulfstream representative Dan Firer.
“But no one asks for that model of so many seats because it’s for private family flights or for presidents of a company.”
Mr. Firer was in charge of Gulfstream’s booth last Friday at the Millionaire Fair, a four-day consumption orgy held at an event center in the vicinity of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, 200 other luxury suppliers had set up their showrooms, hoping to attract wealthy new Russians to all kinds of products, from mahogany yachts to diamond-encrusted car grills worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer cautiously looks at a bright orange Porsche in the booth next door to his own.”
“It’s a nice car, but it’s nickel and boiler compared to us,” he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private jets.”
Fueled by the oil boom, the Russian capital resembles Dallas when it was at its peak.
“We lived the same way in 1890, when some wealthy Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialistic,” says Marshall Goldman, a senior professor at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
“Like the Saudis of the 1970s and the Japanese of the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the biggest consumers and spenders in the world.”
The world’s most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the cake.
Elsewhere in Moscow, this week a conference on the luxury industry will be held with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times company)
Russia has 53 billionaires who make a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, the second-degree rich include 103,000 Russian millionaires whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists from the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a local think tank.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians were below subsistence levels.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow – and that’s why we’re all here,” says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for David Morris, the London jeweller.
She attends the fair for the first time with the Russian distributor of the brand, the Soho Jewelry group.
“Women are impeccably prepared and men are very worthy.”
Visiting the fair on Sunday night, dressed in an afternoon suit, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their clients and themselves as millionaires.
“I was looking at the cars and I’m trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,” said Yumatova, who re-elected off the design suit she wore as a network carpet vetering with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the new rich, the kind of buyers who would be willing to stay for several hours in a warehouse that mixes brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum feather cutters, Mövenpick ice creams, bespoke pool tables, Dubai apartments and Gund teddy bears.
The general public can buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
“The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best,” said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically on a stand of Dutch royal Delft porcelain, in front of a mural-sized reconstruction of a Rembrandt painting, made of hand-painted tiles.
“Of course, Russians are more interested in bling-bling.
In fact, vendors said rich Russians with more trajectories (10 to 15 years, by Russian standards) have changed their tastes from flashy logos to limited edition brands, which would not be exhibited at a trade show.
However, several thousand people – millionaires in cash, emissaries of millionaires or tourists – fill the corridors every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ershov, general manager of King Koil beds, said he sold two $70,000 mattress systems each, made of silk, cashmere and cotton woven with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that customises luxury cars, said he had sold three chain bracelet-shaped car grills, for Rolls Royce Phantom, at $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with rays embedded in Swarovski-colored crystals, so that it resembled a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
“The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes is not necessarily going to drive on those wheels,” says Mr. Karapetian.
“He’s going to keep the car in his garage, along with another 30 or 40 cars.”
Even if many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian clarifies that the phrase "Russian billionaire" does not mean exclusivity, given the surge in real estate prices.
“If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you’re probably already a millionaire, at least on paper if it’s not cash,” he said.
“There are more of them than you think.”
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich by the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red (British-style) phone booths filled with stacks of counterfeit $1 million bills.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake bills for the Millionaire Fair.
Visitors stopped to shake piles of money, asking their friends to take pictures with their mobiles while resting on piles of money, or pocketing a couple of millions.
“You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,” Karryev says.
Surgery "cap" could be the cause of a death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the window of the restaurant "A little healthier" and watched as an ambulance climbed up the White Cape Cod, two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a car from the police patrol appeared.
And then another.
“Then I saw the ambulance go up,” Mr. Livingston, the restaurant’s supervisor, said that Wednesday.
“That’s when I knew someone had died.”
Authorities learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41, an assistant to the Newark police department director.
Now investigators are trying to determine if she died due to a procedure performed by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by police, but who works at the 212 West Scott Avenue house.
The authorities still don't determine what caused Ms. Arroyo's death, but they wait for the toxicology test, although the results will not be available for a few weeks, which will help solve the mysterious death that has haunted the upper ranks of the Newark police officer.
Mrs. Arroyo had been an aide to Police Director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
“She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious,” Mr. McCarthy says of Arroyo in a phone interview Wednesday.
“She was my guardian.”
She protected me.”
Mr. McCarthy said Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and who left two 14- and 11-year-old children, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokesman for County Union Attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives are trying to determine whether Mrs. Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgical procedure.
“That’s one of the possibilities,” Walsh said.
“This is an ongoing investigation.”
Authorities said they arrived at the house about 3 p.m.
November 21 and they found Mrs. Arroyo on a couch.
She was pronounced dead on the spot.
It has been more than a week and authorities have said little about his investigation or about the owner of the house, named Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh could not say whether Ms. Castro has been questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine which part of the house was used as a medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one answered the door at Ms. Castro’s home, where a withered rosebush sits in the front of the house, and a dalmatian thief in the back.
A blue drum labeled "vanillina ethyl" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfume - was at the garage door, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang on one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when he arrived in Newark after 25 years at the NYPD, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable help in getting to know the new island city and its rough political culture.
“She would say, ‘You have to watch with this one or that one,’” he said.
“She was always here when I was, and also when I wasn’t.
It's embarrassing."
Federal Reserve Expected to Cut Rates to Lift Stock Exchange
Shares jumped to both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market waited for the federal reserve to calm credit conditions with interest rate cuts, which were boosted with reassuring comments from the vice president of the U.S. central bank.
Stocks were loosened in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, number two of Ben Bernanke, chairman of the reserve, declared that policymakers should be “flexible and pragmatic” in responding to continued financial market tensions.
In a clear effort to reassure markets amid growing samples of credit exchanges, Mr. Kohn said the recent turbulence was "in part reversed by the improvement in the market at the end of September and during October."
If the upward trend persisted, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments in financial conditions for real estate and businesses, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital into U.S. markets and to make further interest rate cuts, to stabilize credit conditions.
The observations also helped calm Wall Street amid bad news for the U.S. economy, as home sales hit the lowest record in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were accentuated by a notice from Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4% of its total workforce, in a global cost reduction to offset losses from its investments in U.S. sub-prime mortgages.
Only 20 of those positions are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 331 points, or 2.55%, to close at 13,289.40, while the broad S&P 500 index rose 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7%, at closing to 6,306.2, adding more than GBP 39 billion to the value of Britain’s top companies.
Germany’s Dax index rose 2.6%, and France’s CAC40 was above 2.3%.
Earlier, it highlighted the reappearance of credit tension in the markets after a strong demand in a three-month auction of funds from the European Central Bank, which considered these loans to European commercial banks at 4.7 percent, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the performance of the Federal Reserve and the ECB and inject extra funds into the stock markets in London, strained the credit and rates of the three-month “Libor” loans among British banks, signified the highest rise since September, by 6.59%, after a steady rise since November 12.
England sues Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who should hit No. 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, none less important in the face of the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the selection that is on loan – with that particular title at least, he’s here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, decide; and also because the desk of Hugh Morris, the director of England, is starting to fill in offers to become a national selector, and if not, in a part time.
Anyone who doesn’t get sixth place batting will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and so is the sport.
It is not easy to throw what one man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes out of lack of luck more than by ability.
Not only in cricket is choice difficult, it requires judgments that always end up being subjective.
Is it time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another aspect if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good degrees and who know the business well, had been promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what is a good level for a cricket player, unless they give him the opportunity to sink or swim at the next chance?
Figures naturally have a great influence on decisions, but so do they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player has to catch the captain's eye at the same time as taking a "wicket" and a hitter to get opportunities to change the order if he wants to make an impact as a player one day.
But catching the eye of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example, James Anderson, who surely plays in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declares himself for "fit and bowls" as the wind on the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 races each to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but both have had their highs and can expect more from them.
Shah or Bopara games at Asgiriya Stadium can only be a matter of opinion.
The option can break or make a man’s career, or it can mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every race and did well in the first few, with 5 wickets and 40 useful races, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish himself at the same time who became a player of importance, and despite scoring a double hundred against Australia in Australia, can still be underestimated.
The odds are that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after further discussion at today’s session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and favor Shah’s greater experience over the exuberance of the young Bopara.
There are arguments for both.
In Shah’s favor is his brilliant and valuable 88’s debut test in Bombay, 32 hundred first-class against just 6 of Bopara, who, at 22, is seven years younger, and has an excellent track record against spin bowling.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two rounds in May against West Indias in the test at Lords, his home as a Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection from the pickers when Vaughan claimed his place for the next match, seemed to have taken from his "bating" some momentum than in Bombay.
On the contrary, Essex’s team has the joy of living in swords.
He gets caught up in the cricket field and his attitude was summed up as when he dumped his vehicle at an exhibition for England’s car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and presumably a shock, but the first thing he did was take out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who looked at the distance, to say excitedly, “Did you see that?”.
Bopara is the best player, he is including his slippery pass to have effects on his moves that seem to satisfy him, as he beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time, another.
Perhaps that is the true art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which doesn’t mean Shah doesn’t stand out, as the tea leaves suggest, he’s playing here this weekend.
Buses Bring Refugees Back to Work – and Fight Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, expelling the exiles who were left without cash, without visa extensions and those who hoped the city would return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who drove them out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official government convoy made up of a dozen buses, the terminal was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned by private transport.
“I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad,” says Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came back today for what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and what is safe now.”
“They say Mahdi’s army stopped killing people,” he says, referring to the Shiite militia of religious militant Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops to temporarily cease operations.
Qassim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite and a teacher in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with his two children because it was impossible to renew his visa in Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis working in his country.
His Shia neighbors in Amariyah called him by phone to tell him that a U.S. allied force helped pull Al-Qaeda out of its stronghold west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the head of a Sunni and Shia tribe that had been driven from their home in Sleikh north of Baghdad by a grenade attack, after he urged citizens to rise up against al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my comrades.”
“That’s why I’m back today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said they have been drawn to the growing calm in the capital since U.S. troops secured groups of “concerned citizens,” armed and working in cooperation with the U.S. military to defend their neighborhoods.
But many said they had returned because of visa denial and lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have settled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old father of three, gave voice to the common suspicion among exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugees’ visas to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe they have fled the country because of sectarian death squads.
“We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop issuing visas to Iraqis, to force them back into Iraq,” he said.
“I can’t believe in a government that supports the criminals who set my house on fire after I left it.”
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that Sunnis have been expelled from Shia areas and vice versa, relaxing tension.
There is fear that a sudden surge of refugees will bring back sectarian tensions and start fighting.
Little Saarland, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines by the international orientation of its higher schools.
As in the whole country, the Sardinians lack only one field of education.
“Yesterday I explained for the fiftieth time to a non-Sarlander that we are not French” – that was the ironic motorcycle about themselves from the smallest federal state for their fiftieth birthday.
At the same time France and Luxembourg have a large role in the Saar education system that in a study by the Institute of German Economy (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" occupied the fifth place.
Thus, higher schools by tradition have good relations with neighboring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
Until today, students can finish their university career here with two or three diplomas.
As a result, the percentage of foreign students is high, at 15.6 per cent.
However, the number of students from the Saar is higher than average in higher schools, many of whom do not have a baccalaureate.
“In the Saarland, the vocational education system is being taken advantage of,” says Axel Plünnecke, the education sector expert at the Institute of German Economics (IW).
More than five out of every five young people do their baccalaureate in vocational school, so it turns out that the Saarland is 7 percentage points above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety of possibilities for a professional-academic education is very wide.
The offer of double races, in relation to the population number, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical professional training and a growing demand, the number of graduates in Engineering Sciences has dropped by a third in recent years.
That was why the Saar Ministry of Education forced higher schools to do more advertising for specialties in Engineering Sciences.
“After the first PISA study, we made some reforms in general education schools,” a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education said.
Thus the government introduced comparative evidence across the country.
In order for children to start studying the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr" as soon as possible, this model is free of charge, and in the meantime, this model also imitates the other federal states.
Comparison with upcoming studies will show whether student performance has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of backward students in school development fell from 29 percent to 20 percent.
But overall, the Saar did not improve much like other federal states.
In Bavaria, students can calculate better.
To the disgust of the Sardinians, the PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages, although in this field they could achieve good results.
Despite the fact that Sardinians are not French, the language of the neighbors is a compulsory subject in the Institutes of Secondary Education.
Chavez changed the time.
Soon there will be another time zone in Venezuela different from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chavez lets the clock in the South American country change by delaying the clock for half an hour.
Chávez is currently staying as a comedian in Spain.
As reported by the Official State Bulletin of Venezuela, under the new law, the time will be less than four hours GMT.
In this way the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chavez, as the enemy of the United States, justifies his decision by saying that the United States once imposed the obligation on the world by changing a full hour.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the rupture of relations with his neighboring country Colombia because of the hostage-taking action.
The left-wing nationalist said he would have no relationship with either the head of state or the Colombian government until conservative Álvaro Uribe remained Colombia’s president.
“My dignity does not allow me to do that,” says Chavez, who is pushing for constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil country must decide on Sunday in a referendum.
This reform could greatly expand his power in the country.
The reason for the conflict was Uribe’s decision to withdraw Chavez’s mandate in negotiations with the Marxist guerrilla that involved the release of the hostages.
Chavez said Sunday that Uribe’s decision has offended Venezuela.
There is also much talk about Chavez.
A new ringtone causes a sensation in the country: “Why don’t you shut up?” is the phrase that has already been downloaded by half a million people.
This phrase was uttered by the King of Spain who was disturbed by the continued interruptions by the left-wing populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007, the decline in real wages threatened the Germans.
According to one forecast, this year a decrease in real wages threatens German employees despite a strong conjuncture.
Experts present a lot of reasons for a pessimistic forecast.
According to calculations by the Hans Böckler Foundation, German employees are expected to have a lower real salary in 2007 than the previous year.
“The fault for that is the weak evolution of wages, the increase in value-added tax and the tightening of food and energy prices,” Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Cycle Research told the Bild newspaper.
Also the new unemployment insurance charges may be for employees.
Finance Minister Peter Setinbrück told the "Neue Ostanbrück Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention to reduce the burden of unemployment insurance by 3.3% as it passes from one year to the next is fair and reasonable.
Naturally, the labor office does not have to get back into an unpleasant situation, asking for credits and subsidies from the Federal State, in the words of a politician from the German Social Democratic Party.
On Tuesday it was made public that the rate of inflation with the price explosion in the food sector and the oil derivatives sector reached the highest level for 13 years.
When comparing prices with last year, they are increasing by 3%.
Venus: Earth's twin brother.
Although its atmosphere is not suitable for life, Venus is the most Earth-like planet, something that until now had not been raised. The European probe "Venus Express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and swirls at the poles, the same ones that also appear in winter on Earth.
For three decades, researchers had suspected that there might be lightning on Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it has discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus the rays quiet from a height of 54 kilometers from one cloud and behind another, says Cris Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles to the scientific journal "Nature".
According to Urey-Miller’s famous model of the origin of life, lightning caused life on Earth: storms could have triggered reactions in the ocean that, in turn, would have given rise to amino acids that are the building blocks of life.
On Venus it is not so: if there were ever life there, that would have to be in one of the first states of evolution,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there can be no life on the surface of Venus: the atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times higher than on Earth and temperatures of 500°C reign on the surface, oscillating in such a way that temperatures below zero can be reached.
"Possibly, Venus is a 'devil' twin of Earth, but it's still a twin," Russell said.
The main objective of the Venus Express mission is to answer the question of why Venus, so similar to Earth in its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
Since there were no special missions since the 1990s, just for research of this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for the research of Venus.
The latest results of the research to be presented in many “Nature” papers, according to the researchers, underline not only the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
"This also demonstrates that neighboring planets have more features in common with Earth than we had previously assumed," ESA reports.
Despite the already known stormy winds at the North Pole, researchers discovered in the southern polar region also a vortex formed by the faster-spinning clouds.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of wind flows in the high atmospheric layers of the Earth’s poles, as described by a team of researchers from Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet in the Solar System has a mass almost equal to the Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers it is almost as large.
This planet is also called a sunrise star or evening star orbiting the Sun for almost 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: one day on Venus equals 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and its atmospheric pressure of 92 bar does not closely resemble Earth, scientists assume that both planets had formed under the same conditions.
On both planets water had clustered which on Earth remained in the oceans, but on Venus it dissociated into the universe.
While on Earth carbon dioxide had become carbon stones, on Venus it forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's rally with the Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on ending the fight between the parties for the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the German Social Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the rally in September.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, worries about Germany’s reputation and therefore demanded that the grand coalition end that fight for the reception of the Dalai Lama.
“In this case we should not present ourselves as a divided nation,” Koehler told the Handelsblatt newspaper.
At the same time Koehler showed his understanding regarding the reception of the Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Christian Democratic Union Party) in September.
“Although I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are of absolute force to me,” Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in terms of foreign policy, stresses the Federal President, defending Merkel for the reproach she received in carrying out a new policy with China.
“The Federal Chancellor did not distance herself from the traditional course of One China policy.
China knows that too,” Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Social Democratic Party), had indirectly shown his displeasure with the reception of the Dalai Lama and was therefore attacked by the members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its ineffective foreign policy.
The reception of the Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellery caused great misunderstandings in Chinese-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social-Democratic Party), the German Finance Minister, but also, according to news sources of the magazine "Spiegel", froze the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the Chinese head of government, demanded that Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel recognize this reception of the Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming China’s position, Wen Jiabao said China would not accept that European politicians would welcome the Tibetan religious leader into their official position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama showed that he is trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now also includes other provinces.
Schaeuble warns that there will be riots like those in France.
Fights with police in the streets, shootings, car burning: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that riots will occur as was the case in France.
The Federal Minister demands that every effort be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not take to the streets.
Barricades were made, vandals fired rifles at the police: after serious riots involving young people in France, Federal Minister for Home Affairs Wolfgang Schaeuble (Christian Democratic Union Party) fears similar trends in Germany.
“We must also see that our country’s social problems do not take the violent form.”
"We have to take that seriously," he said in the "Neue Presse" newspaper, published in Hanover.
Not all young people develop in the constant change of social reality.
The federal state, federal states and municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, Schaeuble said.
This is not just about the integration of immigrants.
“From the Summit of Integration to the Conference of Islam: all this is already bearing its first fruits.”
It is still early to take the end of the alarm for granted.
At the same time Schaeuble pointed out that the German suburbs do not have the same edifying and sociological problems as in France.
The youths staged serious street riots with police north of Paris last night.
In Tolouse, cars and public buildings were also burned.
Kenan Kolat, the president of the Turkish Community in Germany, demanded greater efforts from the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the unrest in France, warns of an imitating effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, action is necessary.
Kolat said the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under the age of 25 is above average.
Care must be taken to ensure that there are more vocational training positions.
Kolat emphasizes: “We need to give perspective to young people.”
The president of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "there is great social control in families", greater than the French country.
In addition, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat says, “But in spite of everything, we have to be careful.”
We need to "give young people the opportunity to get a job or vocational training faster."
Meanwhile the night in the Paris suburb Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of police took part in the action, a helicopter with headlights overflew the territory.
The authorities responsible reported three arrests, as well as garbage and burnt cars.
Since the day before, a team of nearly 1,000 policemen has been taking care of security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister of Home Affairs, announced that police will take rigorous measures until necessary.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday around 80 police officers were injured by riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The riots continued the following night in Tolouse.
The riot began with a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young men were killed.
According to information provided by the prosecution, the death of the young people was not the fault of the police.
In the Kingdom of Angela Wolke.
The action far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor, shows that the coalition in terms of content has reached its last point and that nothing more should be expected from it.
In what country does the Chancellor actually live?
After her desperate performance, indifferent and without much content in the general debate of the Lower House it must be said: she does not live in the country that would have to be governed by her.
As for the reproach she was made for having repeatedly devoted herself to foreign policy actions, the Chancellor rejected it with a presumptuous phrase.
He said that would be a provincial way and so showed that he did not want to understand what interests the critics.
In the Lower House it was stated very clearly to everyone that this reproach was appropriate.
There was no slight interest or feeling for the country’s problems.
But instead, Angela Wolke presented herself in this way: a very high policy that runs away from foreign policy and stays there without achieving anything concrete.
One example: climate change prevention: she praised herself very much for the decisions made at Heiligendamm, but she says nothing about how these climate goals should be realized here.
In general, this way of praising herself – for two years the head of the Christian Democratic Union Party has not been able to afford so much modesty.
He makes a commitment to expressions so that an impulse reaches the people.
And in this way it damages its public image by the pragmatic conception with which it solves problems without going through the branches.
But in Angela Wolke’s kingdom the inner problems are of little value.
Poverty of children and concerns about low-wage workers?
The only thing he is dedicated to is talking about that subject using subordinate sentences.
It’s amazing how many times you’re wrong when it comes to the supplement for kids.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to formulate a more or less good phrase.
He begins to stumble "as if he had been in unknown territory" when it came to more concrete information.
The attack section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, clashed in a heated debate over Republican YouTube presidential candidates and must now fear only one candidate from the outside.
There are tensions between candidates from the beginning.
Mitt Romney blamed his opponent Rudy Giuliani for making New York “a safe haven for illegal immigrants.”
Giuliani replied to the former Massachusetts governor saying that he was the one who employed illegal immigrants without papers.
The candidates tend to attack: as so far the group of Republicans does not have a clear favorite, the eight presidential candidates take advantage of the debate on CNN, especially to discredit their opponents.
The small 30-second videos, shot by internet users who were uploaded to Youtube, also do not have much content.
“With this mode of isolation we let Hitler come to power,” was John McCain’s reproach to his adversary Ron Paul, the only one in the meeting who insisted on immediately withdrawing troops from Iraq.
Romney also receives much criticism from Vietnam war veterans, when he refuses to recognize as torture "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation, by letting a person drown simulate his death.
Public reactions in the hall in St. Petersburg, Florida show that meanwhile the most important themes of the campaign are others, not just the war in Iraq or the debates about torture.
The public always applauded very strongly when they praised conservative values and denied raising taxes.
So you can see where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
“I was wrong at the time,” Romney said, apologizing to people and the television audience for being an advocate for abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, did not know what to say when asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time, Musharraf rules without a uniform.
One day after his resignation as army chief, the Pakistani president was sworn in as president.
This is the end of eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
On Thursday, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf took an oath for a second five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the constitution and act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday, he transferred his mandate as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after he seized power with a bloodless military coup, the former general rules the state for the first time as civilian chief.
With his resignation from the post of Chief of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main status of the opposition and the West.
The other requirement is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on November 3.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the state attorney general, after the oath Musharraf will very soon annul the state of emergency and meet the second condition of the west.
Since it was declared a state of emergency in the Supreme Court, there have been many jurists who support Musharraf. Last week the country’s Supreme Court rejected all appeals before the controversial new elections of the head of government on October 6.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a convoy of the military in the North Watiristan region, five soldiers were killed and four others were wounded.
According to an army spokesman, a bomb exploded on one of the streets on the Afghan border.
The founders of Krautrock are back.
The most famous German band of the 70s continues its activity: three members of "Harmony" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a re-release a copy of "Live 1974" was made which was written in the band's best era.
In those days they were very famous in foreign countries.
The attendance of these three gentlemen at an official meal caused the sensation.
Each of them has his box, his cables and especially his buttons in front of him.
In the middle sits Dieter Moebius, who is 63 years old and is dressed in a white shirt.
On his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
To the right, looking from the auditorium, is 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Rodelius, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each one contributes with their sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds turn into a piece of music.
This doesn't seem to bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for Krautrock’s fans was the fact that the band Harmonia made music again.
What has to be rebellious here is this: the questions accurately have shown that the name of the band rumbled in the minds of people, but it was not something so special that after 32 years the public missed it so much.
But why can’t the Germans also applaud their living legend of the 1970s?
Especially because the Krautrock misconception was always more valued in England and the United States than in their own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded a "Echo" music award to members of Cologne's Can 2003 band for their living work, in the room you could see the surprised faces of German pop artists.
And when the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf und Neu!, everyone opened their mouths in amazement.
Later Michael Rother spent time on stage during the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been an old friend.
Ignorance in your country and recognition abroad are one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio only existed for two years and at the time did not achieve a great effect in the audience, however, it got it later thanks to the others.
A while ago Moebius and Roedelius had made music with artist Conrad Schnitzler and they had a name, Cluster, that promised a lot of fame.
At first they played in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Then, for financial reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was patronized by a church.
For a while, Rother had a job at Kraftwerk and then worked as a guitarist in the band Neu! He managed to improve the fame of this German band, which at the time was too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed Cluster musicians into exile at Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a 16th-century ruin, they lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Roedelius could complain about his position.
It was an artist’s life full of surprises.
One day, they say, a flag of Ottenstein’s Harmony singing association appeared in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for the art.
There were also disadvantages in using the name Harmony.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second "De Lux".
Although the music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist was not just about knowing yourself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert in Griessem. Someone remembers that, in this recording almost 50 people participated.
Then Rother expressed his desire to propel Harmony and do rehearsals from time to time.
For Roedelius and Moebius this demand is against customs.
In 1975, the band announced their separation.
Rother became involved in themes of esotericism and secured his existence with albums such as "Flamende Herzen".
Cluster revived the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmonia had.
The live recording of the album in Griessmer, that is to be thanked to Groenemeyer.
His music company Grienland set itself the goal of cultivating this own German contribution to preserve it as living music.
Like Roedelius’s work, the band Neu! was again discovered.
The presentation of Harmony as a band takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures from the Wordtronics festival.
There’s Julian Cope, the Englishman, the old punk and the author of the Krautrock Sampler manual.
There is also Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
In this way, all of Krautrock’s influences on the following pop music are present.
Harmony takes the position of a super-band, a position that was empty.
Brian Eno’s phrase accompanied by special music fills the room: “This music is the only true music, it belongs to the future.”
There are photos where Harmony with producers appears on a farm.
The story of the legend’s development is shown in the black and white photo projections, where wired instruments are seen.
At the bottom are three veterans who started improvising again.
They do nothing more than fix the microphones to the organ and the battery to be able to produce extraordinary tones with the help of the effect devices they had built with their own hands.
Today, electronic music is what it should be.
Three people who delve deeper into the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical atmosphere she coughs, whispers and in a good moment of emphasis sings "Aaaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a term of English origin.
It was never about rock.
The origin of the genre was not sought in the blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever here shouts "68!" is also right, but now Harmony keeps calm.
On stage, it reflects very well on what is already evident.
Where does the music begin and where does it end?
That can break one’s nerves or give one quick moments of luck.
Richard Gere only lacks more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Morderischer Frieden" are again dedicated to the war in the Balkans.
But the two did not have much conviction.
Either the concepts are too fixed on actions and shootings or the two movies are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't help in this case either.
At first there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, continue to hide in the mountains of the Balkans, but precisely there, in the dark interior of the country during the Bosnian war, actor Richard Gere was discovered again.
We had finally lost sight of the handsomest man of the 1980s, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant and unimportant roles in women’s films and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important argument to watch perhaps the movie "The Hunting Party--when a hunter becomes what he pursues" (Why do movie titles nowadays have to be so long and silly?).
The film has a marvellous presentation for the eye: deep down, his role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if fate and the film industry hadn’t been so merciful to him. He was a man whose best times of life have already passed, which as a monument to the ruin of his decadence retained until now most of his charm.
“The Hunting Party,” despite this triumph, along with “Merderischer Frieden” which is German production and will also be presented this week, turns out to be just a series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
You can narrate the film "Merderischer Frieden" in a nutshell: it is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serbian from the Kosovo snipers, one of them acts very fast and that also leads him to fall in love with her.
The sense of the film is lost by actions and shootings, although we celebrate that the Serbs are not presented once again as the only culprits.
The film is like the German series "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway, but in a war situation.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" you can investigate, because there was never really a good movie about the war in the Balkans.
At another time, with another director and another screenwriter (Richard Shepard in two counts), the story about American reporters in the war going to detect a Serbian war criminal called “fox,” probably could be a new “Apocalypse Now.”
Thus, the stories are surprisingly similar: the small teams go twice to the mountain to carry out something that the army can not do and each time it turns out to be a journey in madness.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when we first introduce Simon Hunt, who is not allowed to be simply a cynical with a heart.
No, the script also envisions a love affair with a Muslim Bosnia that they will kill later.
Then “The Hunting Party” is very far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes the reporters with impressive speed achieve what they could not achieve for five years NATO, the CIA and all the world’s headhunters, which was to capture the war criminal and leave the Bosnian Muslims to take revenge in a fair way.
It is so bad, that they make you want to appeal to the international court in La Hague based on crimes against kinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in fact, a deeply human one.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karad?i? and Mladi? are still free, and highlights that the Americans and the French are not really concerned about pursuing them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, so that one comes to mind a very famous poem of Brecht.
In this poem it is a mask of an Asian demon: "In the great wrinkles of his forehead I see, sharing the feelings with him, how hard it is to be evil."
In movies like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they prove how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not just the war movies genre in the Balkans.
He recently published in a newspaper that all films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiascoes.
You can also add that there has never been a good movie about South Africa.
A rule almost always applies: when a star gets into a crisis region or minefields, then something like “Rangoon” with Patricia Arguette, “Across All Borders” with Angelina Jolie or “Blood Diamonds” with Leonardo DiCaprio appears.
Possibly all these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
It has to take at least decades for Hollywood to make a good Holocaust film with Schindler’s List as an example.
Classics such as the Vietnam War works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in their time were not celebrated unanimously as the masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about world conflicts, and that is why in our times every massacre (Massenmord) is presented directly on two televisions at home.
And that’s because scriptwriters don’t have the slightest reluctance (which is necessary to be able to) to tell good stories.
“To be or not to be” or “The Great Dictator” turned out to be so good in the end, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn’t know how bad the Nazi regime actually was.
Maybe you shouldn't be a good person to shoot a movie.
Perhaps you have to be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant look at an artist.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "Dictionnaire de Lemprière" and the war in the Balkans, he replied: "That's just because some things never change."
Great cities will always be in danger, men will always be cruelly killed, and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust received negative criticism of the Olympics as a response.
The mayor of Hamburg received much criticism from politics and economics for not soliciting the Summer Olympics.
Many want to keep fighting for competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust remembers that one must be realistic when estimating the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, director general of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, said Wednesday his resignation was "not good for the economic location".
In recent times no other project in the big city has fostered as much motivation as the idea of organising the Olympic Games.
“Without this goal, you wouldn’t be able to keep the political, sporting momentum at the same level.”
Schmidt-Trenz demanded the Senate not to forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "that refers to another time".
Mayor Ole von Beust said on Wednesday that Hamburg's ambitions for hosting the Summer Olympics would not be realized until at least 2028.
“Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympic Games, but it is decided by the German Olympic Sports Federation,” von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Federation of Sport (Sportbund) expected in early December, on the Munich application for the Olympic Winter Games 2028.
“This preference means for us that in this period of time, which until now we thought we would have until 2028, from a realistic point of view we will have no chance at all.”
But this dream didn’t end forever, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets von Beut’s comments.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games.
“It’s too soon to let the opportunity go if plans are ruined right now,” HSB director Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
A waiver of the request is contradictory to the statement of the head of the senate he made at a reception on the occasion of the general meeting of the German Public Sports Federation of Higher Schools (ADH).
There von Beust designated the Hamburg application for Universities in 2015 not as a “replacement” for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week the Higher School Sports Federation appointed Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The German Social Democratic Party (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) accused the Senate of not using such valuable time to build houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the Senate was delaying the development of the small neighborhood of Grasbrook, because this was in plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses," said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, the deputies of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always demanded an integrated planning of Olympia for the small Grasbrook and then the use of the built houses, the CDU underlined the importance of entertainment.
At that time, Hamburg’s application for the 2012 Summer Olympics sparked great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not the wooden boxes.
Whoever connects the terms Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but does not think of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently the wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on Warhol’s list of works.
Most of the ninety-four "type" Brightness-Boxes on this list are fake.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo-Boxes, the Moderna Museet museum in Stockholm carried out internal research and came to disappointing conclusions: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former museum director Pontus Hultén gave to the Moderna Museum in Stockholm, are also a fake of the other hundred.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confusing relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted the wooden boxes in red, blue and white, with the same sample that had "Brillo" soap powder cartons.
According to Warhol, in the exhibition of his 1968 works at the Moderna Museet museum were exhibited hundreds of Bright-cartons. These were not made by Warhol (because of the expenses), but were brought directly from the "Brillo" cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but examples (which were only objects) exhibited.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed to produce in Sweden some shiny wooden boxes, but they were not exhibited at the Modern Museet Museum.
Witnesses of those times now speak of almost fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and auctions as originals of the "Brillo-Boxes" of "Stockhol type" authorized by Andy Warhol.
At auction some of them were purchased for more than $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous director of the Pontus Hultén museum made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed almost a hundred of the wooden boxes that Warhol left to him.
But in reality, 105 boxes were produced in the same year in 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, the head of the Moderna Museet museum curators, investigated six Brillo-Boxes owned by the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. They first printed and ground their tight silvers and then painted them in oil with the brush.
On the contrary, the structure of the 1990 copies shows that the paint was applied with a roller without directly printing the tight silvers.
“These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and must be removed from Andy Warhol’s official Brillo-Boxes list,” says Lars Nittve, the director of the Moderna Museet museum and adds that if the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Commission in New York fails to reach any conclusion, the Moderna Museet museum will classify these six boxes as copies/exhibition objects.
Already in July, the Authentication Commission formally announced that it accepts these “serious accusations” that they are boxes of soap powder.
But from that moment on, everything remained completely silent.
Rebel soldiers surrender in Manila.
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who had entrenched themselves in a Manila hotel and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo have surrendered.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who blames the president for corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter that he could not answer for shedding blood.
Soldiers loyal to the government had assaulted the hotel using tear gas.
Nearly two hundred soldiers had been entrenched in the building for a few hours.
Almost half of them, including Trillanes, were on trial on Thursday for attempting a coup in 2003 that ended in a failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, so that he could suddenly settle down with about 30 supporters.
Evidently the military police who were to watch him had passed into their ranks and followed their riot.
They entered the "Peninsula" hotel and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blocked the neighborhood around the Noble Hotel.
The president called for an urgent session of the Security Cabinet.
Norberto Gonzales, the national security adviser, condemned the soldiers’ behavior.
“People are fed up,” Trillanes said.
“We invite people to join our ranks.”
General Danilo Lim, who had previously led the elite Scout Reangers troops, said that soon the other military troops wanted to follow suit.
Major government critics on Thursday called for a major demonstration against the president.
His government has been criticized for corruption for months.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a site that attracted all the attention for the riot that was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against the democratically elected government in the Philippines.
United Internet will be Versatel’s largest shareholder.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of the shares of telecommunications company Versatel.
On Wednesday, the company reported that the average price for a share is 14.46 euros.
It has only 20.05 percent of the share capital.
There was a lot of speculation about the company’s uptake.
There are also options to further increase the financial share at Versatel.
United Internet reported that with this step it wants to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) market.
On Wednesday, they made assumptions about entering the business, after the bank Brendenberg increased its stake in the Duesseldorf network operator by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
In the financial market this means that the financial institution maintains the equity securities for a third-party partner.
United Internet already the day before involved with almost 10 percent the telecom company Drillisch.
Drillisch placed 17.4 million of the new shares with a value of 106.4 million euros.
United Internet has bought 5.15 million shares of them for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies started with negotiations on commercialization cooperations for DSL-products.
“We strengthen our collaboration,” said a spokesman for United Internet.
The two companies founded an MSP joint venture, to acquire the competitor Freenet.
On Thursday, United Internet reported that at first, the two companies want to be happy with the ten percent stake in Freenet and do not make use of their right, that is, they involve 18.49 percent of Freenet.
That meant both companies kept all the options, especially participation in the Freenet joint stock company.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet over a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This "game" with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German Telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
United Internet and Drillisch’s holding company had 6.01 percent of the stake in Freenet.
Then they had agreed that Drillisch was going to get the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas was already agreed in August.
