Barack Obama will be the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, as the fourth U.S. president in history.
The diploma, medal and check of $1.4 million will receive them, among other things, for the exceptional effort in strengthening world diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will arrive in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and they will have a lot to do.
First, visit the Nobel Institute, where for the first time he will meet the five members of the committee that elected him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
Afterwards, the presidential couple plans a meeting with the King of Norway, Harald V, and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon, the visit will culminate with a ceremony at which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive him, though the third to receive him in office.
The White House has already announced that, upon receiving the award, it will talk about the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid this issue, knowing that he is receiving the award as president of a country that is currently at war in two countries.
Their war efforts increased even more with the sending of additional troops to Afghanistan, which does not forget to mention any of its critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, diploma and check of ten million Swedish kronor (approximately 24 million Czech kronor).
It proposes to donate them for charitable purposes, but it has not yet decided to which specific organization.
During his full program, the President and his wife will participate in a banquet attended by the Norwegian kings, the prime minister and 250 other guests.
Obama had a rather reserved attitude toward the award from the beginning.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling of not deserving it at all.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not only for him, but for all those who fight for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement he mentioned that it represents “a challenge to take action.”
Nature Advocate Accused of Blackmail
Police in Litomice accused the president of the civic association Spolecnost ochránc pírody Litomice (Society of Litomice Nature Defenders) of blackmail.
Last year he appealed several times against some procedures for granting construction licenses and to withdraw appeals he demanded investors money for their own benefit, said Litom-ice police spokeswoman Alena Romová.
The president of the Litomice Society of Nature Defenders is Lubomír Studníka.
He is currently under arrest and faces a sentence of up to three years in prison.
Brno doesn’t like containers too much to separate the garbage
In Prague, citizens can separate the packaging of beverages and in the villages of southern Moravia can be found containers to separate garbage everywhere.
What about Brno?
It takes several minutes to find the respective containers.
I don’t want to say that in Brno the garbage is not to be separated at all.
It seems to me that, to be the second largest city in the Republic, the municipalities are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is totally behind in the separation of trash, not only because we citizens can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but above all because of the number of containers for such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, throwing a PET bottle into the right container?
It is almost impossible, especially it takes a lot of time and patience.
The only place I have found so far is in Moravské nám?stí square, opposite the Potrefená Huse.
Don’t get angry with me Mr. Onderka and his companions, but that seems too little.
Needless to say, elsewhere it’s not easy to separate the garbage either.
That’s why many of my friends prefer not to separate it.
For vagrancy
What happens is that the containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I myself offered, after a party, to throw away several bottles of glass and plastic.
But on Kaunicova Street I didn't see any red containers nearby.
Fortunately, going to the tram I found the right place.
However, the garbage was already overflowing from the container.
It’s still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn’t it?!
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics do not seem to interest the Socialists of Brno too much.
They prefer to buy the city the hockey extra league, which shames us all over the republic, and not to buy more containers or offer the separation of other materials to make Brno cleaner.
I am glad to be able to compare my hypothesis, after surfing the Internet a little, with the official statistics.
According to the EKO-KOM society, Brno is really the worst in the entire Jihomoravsk-kraj region.
Paroubek's budget took money out of rents and sickness allowances
After the left, despite the government’s opinion, adds funds for farmers or officials, there may not be enough money in the budget for rents, sickness subsidies or construction savings.
But neither for the interests of state debt or international litigation.
This will hurt everyone who rules in the second half of next year, Finance Minister Eduard Janota says.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase on some groups, they relied on the government to later borrow for sensitive expenses, rents or sickness subsidies. "That just means postponing problems for the future, it's laying mines," says Janota.
What happens is that, when you borrow money, you have to pay higher and higher interest and, one day, you have to return the money.
The state doesn’t have many options for getting money.
If you do not reduce social subsidies or operating expenses of the state, you have to increase taxes.
To all whom the left has added now: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later on, his children too.
People do not have to worry about income or sickness allowances, they will receive them. Of these accounts 1.8 billion disappeared.
But the price to pay will be the increase in public debt; next year there will be no shortage of only 163 billion, but more.
Despite Minister Janota’s efforts, the debt will continue to rise alongside interest expenses.
The state will need money to cover them and will no longer come to slightly increase VAT or reduce maternity allowances, as the government did in its deficit package.
Due to the dislocations of money for the benefit of some groups of voters, next year will also be five billion to finish the construction of highways and railways.
These are, above all, the sectors in which the tender has already been held and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed and whose price cannot be reduced.
The best thing to do is to keep them, which is also free.
That means delay or cessation of the 30 large buildings; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also in jeopardy, Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka warns.
The SSD proposed a Solomonic solution for the decline in funds: it will get money from the dividends of the mostly state-owned EZ, and add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never safe nor is it a bottomless sack.
Last year, 18 billion euros were earmarked for the budget.
Each year the dividends are settled ecological damages, serve to complete the account for the rents or serve as a reserve for the prepared reform of the rents.
Moreover, with this trick, according to EU rules, the real budget deficit increases to the level of 5.7% of GDP.
The carnival of money transfers does not end here.
Nearly three billion were obtained from the budget to award various compensations to victims of communism and crimes, or for litigation expenses, including construction savings.
It is unclear whether the state will need such funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose any international litigation, we may have to pay for it, Janota says.
Afterwards, the Minister will have to save money within the spring or, in the worst case, take advantage of the government’s budget reserve.
One hundred million are also missing for the two-billion-dollar Sátní pokladna (State Fund) project, which has already been started and should allow online monitoring of what the various authorities are spending.
The first stage begins in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and sanctions will come, Janota warns.
Your future smartphone will work with two operating systems
Americans will have a mobile phone on which the user can, by pressing a key, switch between several operating systems.
The revealed plans sound promising.
At the touch of a button, they switch from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
Precisely this possibility is the goal of the American company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
On your mobile you can have two user profiles at the same time.
They will be able to switch between them and divide them between home and work.
Both operate at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware said in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was introduced in November last year and was demonstrated for the first time several days ago.
It will launch in 2012.
Virtualization of smartphones is no longer a fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a 128 MB RAM, where the aforementioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, work at the same time.
The development of new mobile phone technology is at its peak.
VMware is cooperating with European and U.S. carriers to test smartphone virtualization and these phones will reach customers during 2012.
Lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
It’s not just skiing maintainers in Krkono?e who care about snowless slopes.
Lack of snow means people do not book ski stays at hotels and guesthouses.
That’s why you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Eve.
We have a lot of visitors on our pages.
People look at the offers, check the prices, but are still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask about our opinion, whether this Christmas there will be snow or mud,” said the maintainer of the news portal Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to spend a New Year's Eve in ?pindler?v Ml?n according to their expectations, should not hesitate more to book the stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation second, may try to wait a few more days.
The hoteliers in Pindlerev Mln mainly offer weekly stays for New Year's Eve.
I think they will continue to offer them, but they will soon give in and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will sell quickly, Jandura estimated.
Ingotours, a travel agency from Vrchlabí, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what interests us most is the Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the places offered are still free.
That’s why we’ve already prepared some last-minute holiday stays,” said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
Vrchlabí’s travel agency can still offer New Year’s Eve in Krkonoshe, but there are fewer free places.
The first fourteen days of February are also sold very well, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year the interest in winter stays is impaired by the lack of snow in Krkonoce.
People are waiting to see if there will be snow.
No one wants to spend the weekend in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes remain snowy during the week, the Christmas dates will run out as well,” says Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy the rooms at the Horizon hotel in Pec pod Sn?kou; last year it was more difficult.
We're about five percent better.
For New Year’s Eve and Christmas, we have the last free places.
Interest increases during the Polish holidays in January and February also sells well,” said the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of New Year’s Eve stays are already occupied at the Omnia hotel, near the central car park in Janské Láznó.
On the contrary, at the most recent hotel in Janské Lázn? at Christmas half of the beds are still free.
This January was a big surprise for us, as we are about sixty percent of the occupancy capacity.
February has been a bit weaker, but as soon as snow falls, interest in stays in Krkonoe will surely increase, said Erik Sporysch, the director of the Omnia hotel.
However, at the moment it seems that the hoteliers of Krkono?e will miss the snow waiting.
On Thursday temperatures should drop, and if there is rainfall, it should snow in the mountains.
But then the temperatures will rise again, said Ji? Jakubsk? of Hradec Králové, from the Hydrometeorological Institute of the Czech Republic.
USA: Repetition is the Mother of Wisdom
It is comical that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest man, as a diligent student repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself took for the dumbest.
When he finally revealed his Afghan approach, eagerly awaited, it was shown to be a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only does the same text repeatedly use the phrase “as in Iraq,” but it also did not hesitate to use the title of Bush’s January 2007 statement for its own statement: “A new way forward.”
It was he himself who three years ago criticized Bush’s idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country suffering from the civil war, and that criticized it as “an irresponsible decision with catastrophic consequences.”
The following months, however, showed that Bush’s strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only possible and successful one, so that today nothing is said about Iraq in the news.
Bush's reputation did not improve, however objectively left his successor with a much more favorable initial situation than might have been expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes the miracle will happen again.
The field captains again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation General Stanley McCristal, who, even despite traditional subordinate relations, subjected the undecided riflemen in the White House to harsh criticism.
He asked 40,000 men to improve the situation.
The president hesitated for three months, but nothing better occurred to him, so he at least deceived the general about 10,000 military personnel.
He managed to get Europe to promise him another 5,000, although he himself previously had at least 10,000.
The most problematic part of Obama’s entire strategy seems to be his goal, to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to finish this procedure in three years.
Many doubt that the increase will bear the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraq’s society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: no one can be trusted and no agreement is reached.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, if they are used to changing the boss every day according to their needs.
Political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a people of Potemkin, and patriarchal tribal relations will remain behind.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily complicated because of confusing relationships, even more complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even establishing a state that is “actionable,” a minimal goal of the entire operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama’s strategy is shocking because of his voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to worsen and is now about to erupt.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing of reality, can believe that the military sent to war to "come home soon", will do some miracle here.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is pure irresponsibility, as the Taliban will consider it an indirect declaration of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that Europeans are less and less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, nor do they want to explain to their voters, what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war with Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to get worse and the increased sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to look for the answers precisely when, according to Obama, America initiates the triumphal withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, each such solution will mean a dramatic setback for the Afghan situation.
The only positive for Barack Obama is the fact that the presidential election is three years away and that’s why there’s still plenty of time to find another strategy, if it turns out to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs executives will not receive cash bonuses again
Senior executives at U.S. bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced it to react to the harsh criticism of its salary practices.
The group of 30 senior managers will receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold in a minimum period of five years.
In addition, shares may be withdrawn if they have assumed excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to combine bonuses on Wall Street with long-term power.
I suppose Wall Street is fully aware of the longest path it must take, former JPMorgan investor Douglas Elliott said.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs faced criticism after allocating nearly $17 billion (nearly CZK 300 billion) for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to Reuters, is likely to exceed, despite the measure announced today, $20 billion.
High bonuses in the banking sector became, with the advent of the financial crisis, a sensitive issue in politics.
Britain announced Wednesday that it plans to tax at once, with a tax of fifty percent, bonuses for bankers exceeding 25,000 pounds (approximately 712,000 CZK).
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year, women received Nobel Prizes in all categories except Physics.
Five women, a record number, received this year’s Nobel Prizes in specialized categories and literature in Stockholm from King Charles XVI Gustaf of Sweden.
In addition to the four scientists, a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller, was among the winners.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as her compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel Prize in chemistry was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath and Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for explaining the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last prize awarded, the Nobel Prize in Economics, was awarded by American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for their analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without an award-winning woman, was Physics.
This award was received today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which forms the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each recipient collected the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of the money received.
This sum in each category is up to ten million Swedish kronor (approximately 25 million Czech kronor).
In the event that there are several winners in each category, the prize is shared between them.
The traditionally most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize was received by US President Barack Obama this afternoon in Oslo, Norway.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of having been awarded, since he is at the beginning of his career and is also the head of a country that participates in two wars: in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
To defend his policy he added, however, that in certain situations wars are essential to achieve peace, even if their price is high.
Minister Janota considers resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive finance minister Eduard Janota, who is considering staying in the government, on Friday morning as he disagrees with the version of the state budget for next year, approved Wednesday by the House of Representatives.
The budget, and perhaps also Janota’s stay in the cabinet, is supposed to be the subjects of her Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the public finance crisis.
President Radim Ochvat spokeswoman said about the meeting.
On his remaining in office, Janota wants to negotiate on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
Under the budget law, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163 billion kronor.
The House of Representatives, however, approved on Wednesday left-wing proposals for transfers of funds and increased money for civil servants’ salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government disagrees with the proposals of the Social Democrats, as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the left on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right on the other, there was a serious conflict of domestic policy. Due to this conflict, the future activities of Fischer’s bureaucratic cabinet, whose form was agreed in spring by the SDG, SSD and the Party of the Greens, are beginning to be controversial.
Critics say the budget, in the version approved by the House of Representatives, de facto liquidates the package of savings measures, imposed in autumn by the Fischer government to curb public debt.
Klaus can but doesn’t have to sign the state budget law; today he declared during a breakfast with businessmen that politicians had long neglected “the serious problem,” that is, “the unsustainable deficit” of public finances.
According to him, they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can be supported by a broader consensus among political parties, could improve this situation.
ODS leader Mirek Topolánek mentioned that the budget is appalling and that the government should think about its future existence.
The vice president of ODS, Petr Neșas, told the TK that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of the SSD, ODS and the Greens evidently no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and called similar words “strong sentences.”
The head of the SSD, Ji? Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek saying that the budget deficit is appalling, prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek.
On Wednesday, SSD said the state budget approval for next year was successful.
The folks were happy too.
Mandela in the new Clint Eastwood film, played by Morgan Freeman
South Africans say the new Hollywood film, Invictus: Invincible, tells a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some critics say the starring roles are played by American actors.
The story is about sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is played in his biography by the Oscar-winning American actor, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said Mandela, 91, asked him to play him in the Eastwood film.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I said, "When I interpret you, I'll have to have access to you.
The 72-year-old actor, who received the award for his role in the Eastwood drama about the world of boxing Million Dollar Baby, played the role of the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, which ended up being a slave, of the fictional president of the United States, and even of God in Evan Almighty.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in the Republic of South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him.
The film is a true story about Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation remains racially and economically divided.
He believes he is able to unite his people through sport, and so he decides to unite the rugby players, who belong to the outsiders worldwide.
The South African team managed to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to bring Mandela’s story to theaters.
He had no other goal than to play this role in such a way that it was as close to reality as possible, Freeman said.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, dine with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
Most importantly, he wanted to shake hands with Mandela.
I found that by shaking your hand, I receive your energy, it is transmitted and I had the feeling of knowing how you feel, he said.
For me it is important to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players predominated.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough world of rugby.
A big surprise for him was, when he finally met Pienaar for the first time at his house.
I remember knocking on the door, he opened it and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, “I look a lot taller in the movie.”
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the actors and their real models, and under the management of director Eastwood, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and also talks about ambitions for the Oscar.
Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment with these words: “It was a very good story, a very well made film.”
In movie reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The secret of splendor over Norway solved: the Russians made tests of a missile
A special luminous effect of unknown origin was observed on Norway.
Russia’s defense ministry said it had tested a ballistic intercontinental missile near the border with Norway.
The missile, of the “Bulava” type, previously intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Not even his repeated presence in the missile tests has had the desired effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava, in most cases, did not fly out or there was a failure in the air.
In Russian newspapers they write of "Bulava" as "a missile that does not fly".
A missile that does not fly, but shines.
During the 13th test, there was no problem at first.
At the end of the flight, there were technical problems with the aircraft.
The engine probably exploded in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulava" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which floated submerged in the White Sea.
This type of missile makes it possible to launch from a vessel that is moving and is submerged at the same time.
That’s why it’s likely that the mysterious light over Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failed “Bulava.”
The Norwegians likewise from the first moment did not hesitate that it was a Russian missile.
The generals this time defend themselves by saying that you can’t just talk about a failure.
The first two stages of the missile endured and the failure occurred in the third.
In the previous cases the engines broke down immediately in the first stage.
Although none of the launches went completely error-free, according to the Ministry of Defense management only six of the thirteen were unsuccessful.
The success of almost fifty percent is full of optimism to the generals and that is why they continue to claim that "Bulava" will one day fly smoothly and that it will even manage to carry up to ten nuclear hypersonic blocks, whose maximum total weight is 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA in Moscow at the age of 51.
Legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov will return at the age of 51 to a professional hockey match.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup winner will help his team CSKA Moscow and possibly play Friday in the KHL duel against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov finished his professional career at the age of forty in 1998 and currently chairs the CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash is injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov constantly practices and is committed to helping the team.
We just need to solve some formal issues, AP quoted Sergei Nemchinov, the Moscow club's coach.
It is not yet clear whether the return of the famous player will refer to a single game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who manage to lift the spirits of the other players, Nemchinov said.
If Fetisov returns to the ice rinks, he will become the longest-running professional player in Russian hockey.
Legendary forward Gordie Howe played in the NHL for Hartford at the age of fifty-one, throughout the season, and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the group of five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union he won two Olympic golds, seven world championships, won the Canadian Cup and the World Junior Championship.
In the second half of his career he also had NHL successes: playing for Detroit he won the Stanley Cup twice.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Hall of Glory of Hockey.
Hyundai has met union requirements. It will cancel all additional work
The management of the car factory in Noçovice agreed with the unions to cancel all additional work.
Because of the frequent extra work, the unions declared Monday the emergency by strike.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vank, the spokesman for the Hyundai car factory.
The management, however, wants to agree on another Saturday shift with the unions this year.
We cannot resign to our manufacturing plan as it is essential, which is why we proposed voluntary supplementary work for Saturday, December 19, that is, it will work in two shifts, Vank said.
According to the Sedmi-ka.cz server, the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees working on Saturday’s shift.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, November 28.
The company decided to change the way it motivates its employees with the additional work offered.
Employees can charge the overtime bonus or take a day off on December 28, which is to extend the holiday season by one day, Vank said.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shifts will receive money for the trip and for the meal.
Because supplementary work was the most urgent and problematic point of comments and complaints from trade unionists and strikers, who stopped manufacturing last week, management yesterday afternoon immediately decided to cancel all supplementary work for the month of December.
Employees at the auto factory were forced to work two more hours in addition to eight-hour shifts and this situation lasted virtually every day until last week.
After signing the agreement, the unions will cancel the emergency strike.
Another negotiation between the factory management and the trade unionists must take place on Monday morning.
Union chief Petr Kucha? said on Wednesday that if they pledged to meet the requirements and the document was signed, they were willing to cancel the emergency by strike.
The situation at the auto factory worsened last week when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike over frequent overtime jobs.
They also protested against poor payment conditions and alleged harassment.
Management felt that employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements and be able to supply the cars.
The unionists in their declaration of the emergency by strike on Monday, also demanded that none of the employees, who last Wednesday stopped manufacturing, be penalized in any way.
As far as supplementary work is concerned, the unions demand that the company minimize it.
In addition, this year they require a remuneration of 5,000 kronor for this work.
The car factory in No?ovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
Serial production started last November.
As of last September, it has manufactured approximately 80,000 cars; its current production potential is 200,000 cars per year.
A Czech discovery: an effective substance even in the 'embedded' HIV viruses
Czech and German scientists test new compounds that can moderate the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this improved substance is the fact that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus as some drugs already accessible.
AIDS cannot be cured until now.
However, the life of patients can be significantly prolonged thanks to a mixture of drugs that prevent the replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If virus replication is not completely suppressed, so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, drugs no longer work.
The work of experts from three Institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, VICHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the possibility of mastering the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metallocarborans have an effect on albumin, which is responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
Metalocarborans are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a way different from all drugs used today, and therefore can solve the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists find new, ‘improved’ compounds, prepared by knowing the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus’s albumin.
Metalocarborans have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyhedral cages composed of the boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are joined by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A traitorous and resistant virus
HIV protease is an albumin of the HIV virus, and is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, fractionation of the HIV virus does not occur and mature, infectious corpuscles of the virus would not be created.
If we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient’s body, the scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see table) are joined by a short organic series, which continues to be systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective
The test of the effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was performed in the test tube, and also against its resistant variants, obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metallocarborans on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in clinically used drugs, however they do not lose their effect on resistant variants, in which the drugs often do not work.
The mechanism of the unique effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications makes metallocarborans interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Cezaová, the head of the laboratory of Structural Biology at the Institute of Organic and Biochemical Chemistry and the Institute of Agenetics.
Fight for the budget. ODS attacked Fischer, he defends himself
SDG chief Mirek Topolánek said the budget approved for next year is "shocking" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, he said, think about its future existence.
The declarations of the SDGs were pointed out by the prime minister as strong sentences.
They say that time is left for analysis.
ODS Vice President Petr Neșas said the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of the SSD, ODS and the Green Party evidently no longer works.
The prime minister has to decide whether he wants to lean on the minority in the Chamber of Deputies, who is trying to fight the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in his post with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of the SDGs and social democracy towards the public deficit problem is completely different, Ne?as warned.
The Chamber of Deputies yesterday approved the budget for 2010, however with modifications by the left, for more than 12 billion kronor.
The House of Representatives increased money for state officials’ salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the SDG proposals, as they cover up the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163 billion kronor.
The SDGs before the vote came out of the room and thus fulfilled the government’s wish, that the modified budget is better than a provisional budget.
Disappointment and uselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disillusionment and the feeling of worthlessness; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will reassess the current situation.
He is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened to resign if the amending proposals were approved, the situation could have been different.
According to Eská televisière Janota asked for a meeting with the prime minister.
He pointed out, that he is thinking of staying in the role.
The reason is their disillusionment with the budget negotiations.
If Fischer agrees with another fight against the budget deficit, according to Nesas, nominees for the SSD have nothing to do with the government, which imposed the budget changes.
The prime minister should also state clearly, whether he will resign, whether the House passes other laws that increase the deficit, for example those that relate to subsidies in sickness, income, or the amendment of the service law.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated by the SDG are not to blame
It is the business of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
SDG-nominated ministers have done nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in the U.S. text news.
He recalled, that in several ministries in the posts of lieutenants there are people who belong to the TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
He stressed that if Fischer decides to resign the principle of struggle with the height of the deficit of the public finances, "it is absolutely logical and correct, that it rests on the left-wing majority, which is currently in the Chamber of Deputies".
However, it will not be able to count on the support and tolerance of the SDG members.
I haven’t thought about it, when it’s time, I’ll take care of it, Defense Minister Martin Barták, who was appointed to the government by the members of the SDGs, told reporters in the Chamber of Deputies.
In the afternoon, Prime Minister Fischer went to a European Council meeting in Brussels.
The SDGs gave in at the request of the Prime Minister.
He stressed that the SDGs in the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday would likely vote against the amended budget, if the prime minister did not explicitly ask SDG deputies to allow the budget to be accepted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, reacted to the question, if the SDG does not care about the absence of the party leader in parliament and in the Czech Republic, during the negotiations on the budget.
I didn’t realize my vote was missing.
When he resigned from office, he knew that in the following months it was mainly about Bolshevism of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek reacted himself.
According to the new D train schedule, fewer trains will run for almost the same fares
The Czech Railways (Czech Railways) will cancel or restrict some less-used fast and local trains from 13 December and, on the contrary, strengthen some links.
The total length of traffic will be reduced by two percent compared to today, after the new train schedule comes into force.
Most rates including the basic and customer price will not change.
More possibilities of links to the capital will gain for example the inhabitants of the region of Ostravsko, drahy for this line will add a pendolino cart.
The direct train, on the contrary, will not travel to Bratislava again.
On the line Prague - Písek - ?eské Bud?jovice will run fewer fast trains, the direct links Prague - Letohrad will be restricted.
In the regions, the largest planned reduction in transport by drahy is in the Hradec Králové region, eight percent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and the surrounding areas.
Two night trains will also be canceled on the Prague-Tábor - ?eské Bud?jovice route and some fast trains on the Prague-Písek - ?eské Bud?jovice route will be reduced to only a few days a week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
It is the 15th line of the Esko system, in the vicinity of the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance links to the capital will end at the Prague Hlavní nádra?i station.
There will be more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava, and trains to Umperk/Jeseník will run every two hours.
Starting December 13, travelers will not travel to Bratislava again by Pendolino.
This year’s regional railways account: 200 million more than before
Fast trains are commissioned and paid for by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable losses Drahy will receive next year four billion kronor in total, as this year. Local trains are commissioned by the regions, next year they will pay eight billion kronor in total, and the state will help them almost three billion.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For fast and local trains drahy have a new ten-year contract, so far the contract was always one year.
Dráhy are happy with the system, and perhaps that’s why they didn’t raise the prices of a large majority of the tickets.
Changes will only be made to one-day tickets - D Net and to cheap eLicka internet tickets.
For travelers without a customer card, the D Net price will increase from 450 kronor to 600 kronor.
The price of eLi?ka will depend on the distance, until now there was the single price of 160 kronor for travel between any two regional cities.
Philippine Armed Forces Continue to Detain More Than 50 People, Children Released
The armed forces have kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines, including several primary school pupils and their teachers.
This was reported by the AFP agency, which previously reported only about 65 kidnapped.
All 17 children and one teacher were released after eight hours.
The abduction occurred in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is said that approximately 19 armed men use the hostages as a living shield in the escape to the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree on the surrender of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the armed men belong to the New People’s Army (NPA), an armed fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, police had previously pursued the kidnappers because of the violence, whose cause was the adjustment of accounts between two clans of local families.
In the south of the Philippines in Maguindanao province was because of the recent massacre, in which 57 people died, imposed martial law.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre related to the governor’s election were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the massacre, they arrested the governor of this province in the southern Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of an influential Ampatuan dynasty.
Muslim separatists also operate on Mindanao Island.
However, on Tuesday they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government.
The story of RSA is all about the world, says Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
In the coming days a new Hollywood movie, Clint Eastwood Invictus (his official Czech title is Invictus: Nepora) is released in American cinemas, capturing a part of the biography of former President of the South African Republic Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-renowned anti-apartheid fighter is played by Morgan Freeman, whom Mandela himself chose years ago for the leading role.
The second role, that of legendary rugby champion Francoise Pienaar, was played by Matt Damon.
They are born from the reactions of critics and the public.
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. He was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sacharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, in 1993 he received, along with Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great hopes, since it comes to the public at the time, when in the Republic of South Africa culminates preparations for the world championship in football. At the same time the media are shaken by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the dominant black majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to this new film on RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of the leading roles by the “uninteresting” Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, says he is proud of the new film.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared myself well to play it.
Many times I met in person with Nelson Mandela, to – as they say – charge his energy, he mentioned in an interview after the festive premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it’s good, if through the film we can remember Mandela’s character and message.
It is a history of the Republic of South Africa, but it refers to everyone, he added.
In the suit of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. It portrays the South African human rights lawyer during his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of inhabitants, racially and for long separate years. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also wears the suit of the South African national rugby team and enters the playing field. RSA then won the World Cup.
For getting into the wedge in the suit, which in RSA is considered almost sacred, Mandela won great ovations fourteen years ago, especially from the white public and the recognition of the white inhabitants.
The football championship will perhaps succeed in helping people unite and form a nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
It will still be seen, if the tense situation in the RSA improves.
White South Africans, however, are skeptical, as a rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Brittany, said in an interview recently for LN.
The championship begins on June 11, 2010.
Lounsko burns a transformer worth tens of millions of crowns
The fire caught in the morning a transformer from the eps company in a switch box near the village of V?kov in Lounsko.
According to Lukâ Marvan, the spokesman for firefighters in the Istí region, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Firefighters previously wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by the fire, however they later changed their mind and the fire is extinguishing it with a mixture of water, foam and a special fire extinguisher.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the short circuit of the transformer.
There were no injuries, according to Pavla Mandátová, the company's spokeswoman, the breakdown does not endanger the safe operation of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million crowns, enumerating it exactly will not be possible before the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandatová, it will be necessary to replace the destroyed transformer with a new one.
During the ten years of eps activity nothing similar happened, the breakdowns of this type are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, the spokeswoman for the EZ society for Northern Czechia, electricity supplies were not cut, and the fire of the electric substation did not affect the operation of homes, offices or companies.
In the territory of the Czech Republic I was the exclusive maintainer of the distribution system, of the electric conduction of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the electrical energy from the transmission system to the distribution system, in addition to maintaining the electrical conduction of 4339 kilometers long.
Janura to file slander complaint against three SSD Hetmans
Student Agency owner Radim Janura will file a slander lawsuit today against three social democratic Hetmans.
These are Michal Ha?ek from the Jihomoravsk? kraj region, Radko Martinek from Pardubick? kraj and Olomouck? kraj Hetman Martin Tesa?k.
Janzura mentioned it in twenty minutes on Radio Urnál.
The demand has to do with the company’s effort to maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions, however, ended up signing long-term contracts with the Drahy.
All three Hetmans are attacking us and talking about the fact that we are "taking the raisins out of the cake", however we brought only the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Drahy Eské, which is not true. We know the prices of the Drahy Eské, which were set last week.
So we have nothing but to defend ourselves.
It's because of the slander towards the Student Agency society, he said for Radio'urnál Jan'ura.
He mentioned at the same time having the evidence of all the regions. According to him they have not taken necessary measures in harmony with European law.
That is why it is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Hasek considers this denunciation for the continuation of Mr. Janura’s media show, which serves as free advertising for his company and for himself.
Naturally, I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region, and I appeal to the other Hetmans to do so too.
I suppose, on this occasion too, it will be clearly demonstrated, that Mr. Janura manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport, and uses lying and false arguments, mentioned Hasek.
Janura announced last week that he would invest several million kroner in advertising, whose goal would be to warn of these measures from the regions.
Radio Urnál told him that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue it after the New Year.
He said the campaign will be carried out against corruption as such.
Janura started the campaign after the regions agreed with Eské Drahy to maintain regional rail links and for the order of approximately 150 billion kronor they did not convene a tender.
According to Janura similar steps are at odds with the law and the opinion of the European Court.
Janura claims to have been threatened by an SSD deputy, due to his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was that if we don't leave it, we could lose the bus licenses.
He presented himself as an SSD deputy, I know, what gentleman it is about, I’m not going to say his name, Janura said today for Radio Urnál.
The pneumococcal vaccine will be free and voluntary.
The pneumococcal vaccine from January will put an end to the usual customs.
As a first vaccine it must be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, there are already opinions that the mandatory vaccine would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free pneumococcal vaccine culminate.
The Institute of Medicines is already setting maximum prices for vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
Experts are already clear on the vaccination procedure.
The New Vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
From January onwards, children born since August 2 of last year can receive the pneumococcal vaccine free of charge.
The condition is not having received a single dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started the vaccine last year or earlier have to cover other doses of the vaccine as well.
The first dose of the vaccine has to be received between the third and fifth month of age of the child.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily allowed their children to be vaccinated against pneumonia.
Parents, however, paid for a dose of 1,600 crowns and more.
To vaccinate younger children, four doses are needed.
Generally experts estimate, that insurance companies will spend on vaccines from 300 to 450,000 kronor annually.
However, they will save on treatment, which is needed for unvaccinated children.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 on all children’s vaccinations annually.
Covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcus is the cause of otitis media, but also of serious infections including meningitis and sepsis.
Of pneumococcal infections in our country every year 28 children no older than 10 years die according to research in hospitals.
In addition to the Czech Republic, pneumococcal vaccine coverage for children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be mandatory?
At the same time, however, there are opinions that this vaccine may be mandatory in the future.
From January it must be covered by insurance companies and voluntary.
The mandatory vaccine would be better, said Rudolf Kalovsk, the head of the Nahlas civic association.
Their association has been spreading pneumococcal vaccines for a long time.
The experts at an international conference, in which our association participated, were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It's not entirely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to achieve at least this.
I think this is the path we now have to take, Kalovsk? mentioned.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination procedure.
At the moment we do not think about it at all, said its spokesman Vlastimil Sr?e?.
Voluntary Vaccine Has Its Disadvantages, Doctors Say
The president of the society of pediatricians Odborná spole, Hana Cabrnochová admits, that the voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages.
"In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, we relatively understand the political decision to have started vaccination as a volunteer," says Cabrnochová.
Experts expect that as of next year more than 80 percent of young parents will let their babies vaccinate against pneumonia.
The pneumococcal vaccine is a big change also because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to then save on treatment, Cabrnochová explains.
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines for themselves.
However, pediatricians are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be bought by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just like when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some MPs, however, were afraid that insurance companies could “take the money out of health insurance.”
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines and wait until they are paid for by insurance companies.
It is estimated that pediatricians will invest 40,000 per month in vaccines, which is a notable sum.
It won’t be easy, Cabrnochová says.
The son of an American artist involved in "theft of a museum"
The son of renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been accused of trying to steal $20 million worth of paintings from his father’s museum.
Pennsylvania police say Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught carrying 90 pictures in his vehicle and trailer.
They say Frazetta and another man used an excavator to break into the museum in the Pocono Mountains region.
Frazetta, 81, is famous for his portrayal of such characters as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
The Associated Press reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
An unidentified police official said a family dispute may have motivated the young Frazetta.
The agency reported that Frazatta's 52-year-old son told police that his father had ordered him "to enter the museum by any means to move all the paintings to a warehouse."
The agency said Frazetta's father denied granting such permission.
Labour Party Advocates Tax Increases in Budget
Ministers have defended tax increases and spending cuts in the pre-budget report, in the face of criticism from the opposition, businesses and trade unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling "wasted" an opportunity to show his seriousness about cutting the deficit, delaying decisions until after the election.
The Minister of Finance also received harsh criticism for harming low- and middle-income workers.
Among its main proposals are a 0.5% increase in Social Security spending and a 1% cap in public sector wage agreements from 2011 onwards.
Anger for Social Security
Unions have lamented that low-wage workers are being punished by a recession generated by others, and warned of future “problems.”
The increase in Social Security spending, which is set to grow by about ?3 billion a year, has angered the business community, which claims that this is a tax on jobs, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those earning more than $20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
KEY POINTS OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social Security with an additional increase of 0.5%, as of April 2011
The economy will contract more than expected 4.75% this year
New 50% tax on banker bonds
1 point increase in corporate tax for small firms was ruled out
Tax breaks for electric cars and wind turbines
State pension would increase by 2.5%
According to the estimates of the Ministry of Finance, a person who earns 30,000 pounds will lose 90 pounds a year and a person who earns 40,000 pounds will lose 190 pounds, while a person who earns 10,000 pounds a year will earn 110 pounds.
The ministers said their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 involved "difficult decisions" but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would fall on 5% of the higher wages.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the tax hikes and spending cuts outlined were a “sand grain in the desert” compared to what was needed.
"These are big figures, it will allow us to cut the deficit in half, which is absolutely essential for the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident that the economy would grow again by the end of the year.
However, the Labour party’s forecasts for future economic growth, which will influence how much to borrow and how quickly the deficit is reduced, have been questioned after the Finance Minister was forced to modify the first figures.
In his statement, he stated that the economy would likely contract by 4.75% this year, much worse than the 3.5% decline forecast in April, while borrowing would be about 3 billion more than previously estimated.
"Opportunity wasted"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new publicity campaign on Thursday, warning of the Labour party’s “debt crisis,” said the $789 billion loan application projection for the next six years was unsustainable.
Ministers had failed to come up with a credible plan on how they would return the money, they added, “cynically” dodging difficult choices until after the elections due in June 2010.
"They haven't included anything significant about what they're going to do," said Treasury Department shadow minister Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do it and they've wasted it."
“All important announcements will be made after the election, win whoever wins.”
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour party insists that schools, hospitals and the police be protected from future cuts, unlike conservative proposals, which would seek further short-term deficit reduction.
But Liberal Democrats said the money raised by tax increases and spending cuts would be used to sustain next year’s spending, not to reduce the deficit, arguing the projects were like “sandcastles.”
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the timing chosen for the announcements, such as rising inflation of some disability subsidies next April, would leave the Finance Minister exposed to accusations of election maneuvers as the money could simply be recovered the following year.
However, the Labour Party insists that it is providing the people most in need and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although ministers did not publish post-2011 spending data, economists said it was clear that the adjustment in public spending would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Fiscal Studies Institute said the Finance Minister’s figures involved substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including transportation, higher education, science and defense in the future.
“This is really postponing the pain for later,” said director Robert Chote.
“All major announcements will come after the election, whoever wins,” added Roger Bootle, economic consultant to Deloitte’s accountants.
"This has been the false report before the budget. Markets realize this."
FBI investigates "American arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the detention in Pakistan of five American men suspected of extremist connections.
The U.S. embassy in Pakistan told the BBC that the men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern province of Punjab.
The FBI has said it is investigating whether they are the same men who disappeared from their homes in Virginia last month.
The U.S. Foreign Ministry said it was also looking for information about the men.
It is reported that three of them are of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
“If they’re American citizens, of course we’re going to be very interested in the charges they’ve been arrested for and what kind of circumstances they’re being held in,” Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
“We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if indeed these are the students who were missing,” the spokeswoman said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were detained in a house belonging to one of their uncles.
He said the house was already in the sights of local police and that no charges had yet been filed against the detainees.
Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, Reuters reported, but said the U.S. had to "work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan, to try to eradicate the terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people."
The families of the five students reported her disappearance in North Virginia in late November.
Amnesty International condemns Iranian “abuses”
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have always been equally deficient, according to a report by the campaign group Amnesty International.
The report details the regime’s “models of abuse” before and after the presidential elections held in June.
One man quoted in the report said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes and another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected previous criticism of its human rights record.
Officials have said such criticisms have a political foundation.
Thousands of people arrested and dozens killed in Iran following President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s election sparked the biggest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens have been sentenced, and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, says that during the protests, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei acknowledged some allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention center.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance for criticism, according to our correspondent.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International quoted the story of Ebrahim Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer science student, who claimed he was accused of “working with Facebook networks” and protesting against the election result.
“They often hit me in the face” according to his words.
“They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, my head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me.”
Amnesty said that after five days they signed a false confession and released him and left him on the street, still bleeding and semi-conscious.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said some protesters detained after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied the rape allegations, but admitted there had been abuse.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who claimed he was held in a container along with 75 other people for more than eight weeks, at a detention center in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had established committees to investigate the post-election malaise and the government’s response, but said the agency’s mandate and powers were confusing and the parliamentary committee’s inquiries had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been detained in the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was made in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a Bristol site of interest into a racetrack.
The Runway at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park was a short jump ramp, opposite a 100-meter-long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the track, but it was pretty scary.
It is seen below a beautiful view of the flickering city lights.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, real talent.”
Awards were given to the best tricks or maneuvers performed on the track.
After the Thursday afternoon event, the snow will melt.
Still them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have called for a ban on minarets and there is a widespread warning about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a detailed report and studied the possible integration of Muslims (who are actually integrating) into one of the most openly secular societies on the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author's latest work "Why the French Don't Like Headcarves" (2006), an elegantly and thoroughly argued study of a problem that divided and worried the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still perceived today.
Mr. Bowen’s latest book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide France’s 5-6 million Muslims with what Mr. Bowen calls “Islamic spaces.”
He is a good listener who reproduces debates between teachers and students about the questions they are most interested in.
Should a Muslim get married in a mosque or a town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to obtain a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane issues, he argues, of daily life that concern the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of magnets, professors and intellectuals, none of them renowned, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim scholar and scholar born in Switzerland.
This new generation tries to open the debate about how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They are unable to spread this argument completely.
Conservatives doubt only the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists Mr. Bowen interviews tend to disagree with his Salafi counterparts, supporters of purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
It questions the extent to which French political strategists (and the intellectual elite so fiercely defending secularism) are truly committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims are likely to be treated more unfairly than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historic commitments to secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, it perceives “an adjustment of values.”
After reading this book, one tends to say, "Yes, but not yet."
The most bleak panorama in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming speed, taking with it life that cannot survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transportation and fishing have focused on newly opened waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a consequence of this.
In "On Thin Ice" Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the northern icon, the polar bear.
Knowing the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who gave valuable tests in the face of the white bear.
Admiral Nelson’s encounter as a valiant 14-year-old cadet, struggling only with the end of his musket, is surely a myth, but others are true.
The young, caught while swimming following the bodies of their newly exterminated mothers, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus presentation in the early 20th century exhibited 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, zoo enclosures are still generally one millionth the area of a wild adult. The climate is almost never adequate: a polar bear resident in Singapore turned green by algae growing within the hairless areas of its fur.

Ellis resorts to stories from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although banned in Norway, the U.S. and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and snowmobiled Eskimo Indians use high-powered assault rifles to shoot down their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two hunting nations where the ice will last the longest.
In his new book, After the Ice, Alun Anderson, a former New Scientist editor, offers a clear and chilling account of the science of the Arctic and a startling look at how the future of that place can be transformed.
It’s not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
It's not for lack of commitment.
Fridtjof Nansen’s pioneering travels in the late 19th and early 20th centuries first gave clues about the displacement of ice masses.
Then the Cold War submarines drew a map of the moving ice lanyards that circulate beneath the ice masses.
Satellite scans and extensive series of iceberg-mounted probes are a useful supplement, but resilient individuals camped in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extraordinary, tiny world of the tributary system within the Arctic ice, formed by streams of saline water that compresses as it freezes.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders of the interior, they are all doomed once the summer ice retreats, which is thought to happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months...this could be us
Marines among the 6,000 who place crowns on Arlington's tombs
De'Angelo Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to place a single crown on the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate tombs, it was a day to pay tribute to men and women who once stood in their boots.
In a few months, from where we’re being shipped, these could be us,” Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If it’s us, I would want someone to do the same for me, so I’m just trying to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to place crowns on the tombs of veterans in various sections of Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Crown Company in Harrington, Maine, kicked off the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred graves at Arlington Cemetery.
In what is already an 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the journey every year stopping in different cities along the way, to officiate events dedicated to military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a nonprofit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns in the tombs of Arlington Cemetery, areas at the Pentagon, tombs at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City, and at the United Airlines Flight 93 memorial site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her late husband, a military career.
As long as her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this was his way of giving retribution to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way that civilians can support our troops, he said.
It’s like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked through the cemetery’s broad meadows and hills.
Volunteers headed to older graves from World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War, because they don’t get as many visitors as new graves, organizers said.
The atmosphere was cheerful as the children played and the couples held hands, while carrying the fresh pine to the tombstones.
Each circular crown was a deep green, with a small red bow tied at the top.
Nearby, Section 60, where most of the veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are buried, was virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the bleak atmosphere of current wars invaded the area.
People cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends leaned on each other in the icy air.
Some read aloud names carved into the stones, while others leaned to see small black and white plates placed inside the wet mud, for those whose tombstones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wiped tears from her eyes in front of her son’s grave.
He drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of Navy gunner Sgt. David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. . my son paid for it, he said.
“Long after my death I want someone to remember it.”
Cuban Officials Arrested U.S. Government Contractor
The Cuban government has detained a U.S. government contractor who distributed mobile phones and laptops in the country, State Department officials said Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Bethesda-based Development Alternatives Inc.
The company works on projects for clients such as the United States Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officers along with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on Dec. 5.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be detained for almost anything deemed “dangerous.”
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical writings, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a fledgling blogger community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sanchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has asked on several occasions for permission to leave the country to accept prizes, but the permission has been denied.
The arrest of a U.S. contractor can likely provoke tensions between the Castro brothers’ communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been seeking a “slow-paced” approach to improving relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to release the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobiles and laptops are legal in Cuba, even if they are new and coveted products in a country where the average salary of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones only this year; they are mostly used for texting, as a 15-minute phone conversation would cost the daily wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign hotel visitors, and in some government establishment, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, said most of the handful of U.S. citizens in jail in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said she could not provide further information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are clearly misguided.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, such as handing out free mobile phones, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas program of Human Rights Watch, which recently published a tough report on freedoms in Cuba, called “New Castro, Cuba itself,” a reference to Raul Castro’s location as the country’s leader, to replace his sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the defendants are often detained, prosecuted and jailed in a day.
He said any solution would likely be political, and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities neutralized the alleged brain of a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hope the case could help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who roam the internet in search of radicalized youth.
Investigators said they were chasing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the YouTube video site.
Saifullah led the men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan’s tribal belt, which is a familiar place for al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been briefed on the case said on Saturday that Saifullah could not convince al Qaeda commanders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
Consequently, they were isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the imposing mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered as part of a covert operation.
For this reason they were rejected, said the official, who spoke from anonymity because of the delicacy of the case.
The official said the men were not muted and were even trying to get proper approval to access al Qaeda camps when Pakistani law enforcement arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI, underscores the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, determine who they are trusted.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, U.S. intelligence has prioritized trying to infiltrate people into al Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, not letting pass those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to holy war, and those who could be spies.
Analysts said al Qaeda is focusing on aspiring U.S. recruits.
But for the organization they represent a huge appeal, because of their potential to have access to American targets and because of their propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst for the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years than those admitting, because U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you’re trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed,” Kohlmann said.
It has become a much more web-based model.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demand 'climate action'
On Saturday tens of thousands of protesters marched here through the streets demanding more bold climate action from negotiators working at the city’s Bella Center Convention Center.
Protesters said 100,000 people participated in the event, but police estimated the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On a day when little happened in the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked around the city holding banners in English that said “There is no planet B” and one in Spanish that declared, “Earth says “enough is enough.”
Several celebrities joined the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said travel to Peru, her mother’s home country, made me aware of the distressing issues the country must deal with due to the impacts of climate change that are already happening.”
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to the leaders of the world, to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way to evade it any longer.
Police prevented protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, saying they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
Under Danish law, these activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a witness, who asked not to be identified for being involved in the climate talks, activists in sports masks and black outfits placed several explosives near the main canal in Copenhagen, which is close to several ministries.
They were around the buildings, he said, adding that they started out as flares, but were followed by "a couple of big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around the TV screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to penetrate the consciousness of key officials such as China’s chief climate negotiator Su Wei.
Asked if he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, “I really wasn’t aware of the situation.”
He then went on to say in Mandarin, "as the meeting place is large, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He pointed out that it depended on each person’s perspective to define whether the march was being detrimental or beneficial.
He said this shows the attention of the general public and different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, “it can also be said that they affect the negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
Test Data Reveals Persistent Racial Differences
Last week’s federal scorecard on math performance was very good news for public schools in the Capital District.
Although the District is still far from the country’s best-performing systems, the gradebook showed that fourth- and eighth-grade students stepped on at a faster pace over the past two years, compared to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is recorded in the recent figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent difference in performance between African American students and white students, both locally and nationally.
Average D.C. white fourth graders’ scores over the past two years grew from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their African American peers rose only three points, from 209 to 212.
In fact, the performance gap grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of eighth-grade African Americans remained essentially fixed, dropping a statistically insignificant point from 245 to 244.
The average white scores were not included in the test results, because the sample size was not large enough.
Over a six-year extension, the picture is no more encouraging.
The difference that separated fourth grade black and white students in 2003, when the first ENPE was released in the District, was 60 points on the scale (262 to 202).
Although the scores achieved by the children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has narrowed to just 58.
Some education lawyers in the District expressed concern last week, as advances celebrated by Rector Michelle A. El Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were largely driven by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the ensemble by serving those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit that advocates for educational equity in the District.
I’m not jumping for a two- or three-point difference, said D.C. Council member Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-By Accumulation), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of the Eaton Elemental.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee’s management style, said the message from the test scores is that the city’s high schools have a desperate need for attention.
Clearly they always want to see the positive signs, and I respect it.
But what’s worrying is that we’re not devoting the time or energy needed for our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of underperforming students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at elementary and middle school seniors who have not mastered the basics of early reading in their school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
Everyday math, a mathematics curriculum from kindergarten to sixth grade, which emphasizes games and real-life experiences, was introduced to the District under former superintendent Clifford Janey, who is credited with some of the progress reported by the ENPE last week.
I just think we have to keep working to offer the best interventions to those students who are below the grade level, Rhee said.
Others say the ENPE results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low-performing schools, which will be needed to narrow the gap.
Here’s a kind of scrupulous dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies urban test scores.
The solution of conventional policy is to allocate its resources and administrative reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of D.C.
Then the target can generate political repercussions that run counter to that important timeline.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban superintendents, she tries to cling to the black and white middle class.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children can access excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of Newark schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element of ending the performance gap is extending the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with autonomous schools.
It takes nearly 200 days to have the strength of change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with her teachers’ union last year in a 185-day year, which she sees as a “indicator” for seeking a bigger increase in the next agreement.
Making higher education a part of more futures
The tour bus arrived at the University of Gettysburg with a strong relay.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, descended and blinked for a moment in front of the white columns, brick facades and emerald meadows.
Graciela’s parents had barely graduated from a high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Still, when she and the group’s other eighth graders explored Gettysburg, where tuition costs $38,690 a year, her attitude was less that of impressed guests than that of enthusiastic prospective students.
Yes, here I am! exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
“Oh, really,” he thoughtfully said, when the guide talked about the school’s low teacher-to-student ratio.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that the children had visited on their three-day trip, and had already fully absorbed their deliberate message: The question isn’t whether you’re going to college.
The question is which one.
While there is growing concern about the large number of U.S.-born children of Hispanic immigrants dropping out of high school or becoming pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands who access college education they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these “second generation” Hispanics graduate from college, a remarkable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, the researchers say, because they point the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the country’s workforce.
Those who analyze the highest-performing say they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to make up for their unfamiliarity with American schools.
But mentorship programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college, particularly if efforts are sustained over time.
Looking at low-income children, whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it follows that any intervention at any time is not going to fix it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latino students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the Graciela University Tour is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems to run college readiness programs, which start when low-income students are in middle school and continue until they finish high school.
Since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent attending college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraq's oil ministry reaches deals with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns over violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to lure major oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure, during two auctions that concluded Saturday.
The 10 agreements that the Iraqi oil ministry has reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are poised to play a leading role in restoring Iraq’s oil industry, which has been mutilated by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies moved away having climbed into only two of the 10 auctioned sites.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began Friday.
The only one who made an offer lost.
Two U.S. companies reached bidding deals in June.
The poor representation of US oil giants in the opening of Iraq’s oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, there are Asians and Europeans at the head, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news center.
It will be a long time before something else is on offer in Iraq.
Security concerns, heightened by massive coordinated bombing on Tuesday, and political instability as the U.S. military pulls out, likely prevented U.S. oil companies from taking more vigorous risks in Iraq, which has the world’s third-largest oil reserve, analysts said.
U.S. companies were in some cases disadvantaged, because rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have considerably lower labor costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc were the only U.S. companies to reach agreements with the ministry.
Major U.S. firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have tightened ties with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and provided technical advice in recent years, have walked away empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese state-owned National Petroleum Corporation offered in more contracts than any other company and made large investments in contracts for two major fields.
We know that China is on track to become a major economic and technological powerhouse, Oil Ministry spokesman Assam Jihad said.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be on par with its competitors and deliver on its commitments to Iraq.
The companies shortlisted to submit proposals made bids that later faced the barrel grant the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above current levels at each site.
Al Qaeda’s top planner has apparently been killed in Pakistan
An alleged U.S. missile attack on Pakistan's border with Afghanistan is believed to have killed a top al Qaeda operations planner this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials said Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men believed to have died on Tuesday when a pair of missiles struck his car near the city of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were launched by an unidentified aircraft of the type operated by the CIA inside Pakistan’s illegal tribal zone.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car received the impact, an official with Pakistan’s civil intelligence agency said, speaking on the phone from Miran Shah.
The official said suspected local militants rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what was left of the “fully shattered bodies.”
Local authorities were unable to verify the victims’ identities, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as a high-ranking al Qaeda military planner, who led the terrorist group’s operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He conspired around the world, said a senior official, who spoke from anonymity, citing the delicate nature of U.S. airstrikes inside Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included conspiratorial attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had strategic guidance from al Qaeda’s top leadership and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said Somali had risen rapidly in al Qaeda ranks and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a known name for some Americans, but that doesn’t diminish in any way the threat it posed to us and our allies, the second official said.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second al Qaeda leader or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal zone, and three other high-ranking operatives.
The pace of CIA-led unmanned aircraft attacks has slowed since the summer, from an average of about six operations a month to two, according to a count in The Long War Journal, a website run by a nonprofit.
The decline is perhaps due to an improved tactic by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while ruthlessly killing suspected informants, the site said.
U.N. envoy in Kabul about to resign
U.N. envoy Kai Eide said on Friday he would step down in March, ending a tumultuous term that was hampered by allegations of widespread corruption in Afghanistan's U.N.-backed presidential election.
The departure of Eide comes as the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said he supports the increase, but he is concerned that the U.S. timeline for the military withdrawal that begins in 18 months will push other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the readiness of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans so they can trust the international community, Eide said in a phone interview from Kabul.
The commitment has to be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian officials, who are collaborating with Afghanistan’s political transition.
The increase in the military sector must be reflected in the civilian sector, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008 to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the Secretary.
U.N. General Ban Ki-moon, so he had time to find a replacement.
“What I’ve said is that it’s best for them to start looking for a successor,” Eide said.
When I arrived here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor’s departure and my arrival.
Ban has begun seeking a replacement, according to U.N. officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peace missions.
Eide’s position in Afghanistan was put to the test by his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country’s presidential vote and covering evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the allegations, but said the accusations by Galbraith, who was fired, "certainly damaged the mission, because there was already a lot of skepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate assistance efforts by U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more US and other Western personnel, who lend themselves to the Afghan mission, saying this would increase their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed frustration over limitations on his powers in Afghanistan, arguing that cumbersome UN hiring regulations undermine his ability to attract talent.
That’s how the UN rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That is catastrophic and it cannot continue.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers will soon impose “significant additional sanctions” against Iran for its failure to enter into talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of roughly 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq, during a week-long trip to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, downplayed the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier’s question about the likelihood of such an event.
One of the things that weighs on me is that, if we’ve learned anything from Iraq over the past six years, it’s the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions aimed at Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population as a whole.
He argued that it would take “a package of incentives and disincentives,” “to persuade the Iranian government that they would actually be less safe with nuclear weapons,” because “their people will suffer enormously” from sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement from White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in warning that Iran will face "credible" consequences if its nuclear program does not fully comply with the instructions of the UN Security Council and its nuclear control body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on Oct. 1, he said he would re-negotiate the restriction of his nuclear program and agree to leave a substantial part of his supply of enriched uranium, in exchange for the fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement, as a way to build trust between the two sides and gain time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran appears to have moved away from tentative deals, in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided over the possibility of engaging with the United States.
Frankly, I think Iran’s tightening up with the international community on some proposals they actually accepted in early October has united the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, in a way they haven’t been in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set a December 31 deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before rethinking other options, including pursuing what Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “devastating sanctions.”
In a statement made in New York, Iran’s mission to the United Nations denounced what it called Thursday “unfounded and baseless accusations” from some Security Council members about Iran’s nuclear activities, and said it has the will to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers, “in order to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution.”
Gates, who was returning to Washington last Friday, met Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region of Iraq to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and participation.
Gates urged both sides to lower the potential for the conflict, to avoid any delay in U.S. projects, to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to alleviate Kurdish anxiety over the pending reduction. US officials quoted Gates’ words to Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: “We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them.”
In an ageing China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that preached to them that “Mother Earth is too tired to support more children” and “one more baby means one more grave.”
They learned the lesson so well that when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by the low birth rate and the aging population of their city, suddenly changed course this summer and started encouraging young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instantaneous and firm: No way.
We have already given all our time and energy only to one child.
We have nothing left for a second, said Wang, 31, a human resources manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the one-child policy was introduced in China, creating two generations of notoriously stubborn, single-children misbegotten, affectionately nicknamed “little emperors,” a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has plummeted to 1.8 children per couple, compared to six when the policy became effective, according to the Division.
The UN demographic, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is projected to explode from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050. This is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is worse in wealthy coastal cities with highly educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of Shanghai’s registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of Shanghai’s Family Planning and Municipal Population Commission, said fertile couples must have babies to “help reduce the proportion of the aging population and mitigate a future labor shortage.”
Shanghai is about to be “as old (not as rich, however) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden,” he said.
Gradual Relief
Drafted into the country’s constitution in 1978, China’s one-child policy is arguably the most controversial mandate ever introduced by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate the policy face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and job discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for its contribution to avoiding critical pressure on its natural resources, while human rights defenders have reported abuses in the imposition of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have had abortions according to the sex of the fetus, leading to a high unnatural male-female ratio.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually softened their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife are sole children, and in 2007 they mitigated many of their hardline slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Beijing University’s Demographic Research Institute, said central government officials have recently been debating even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is the only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight, posters ordering families to have only one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be suitable for a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples at their homes and slide leaflets under the doors.
It has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say the response has been very little overwhelming.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural city on the outskirts of Shanghai say they saw a moderate increase in requests for couples who want a second child after the campaign’s launch, more urban districts do not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still only expected to reach around 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009 but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee at Shanghai’s Caolu municipality, said financial considerations are probably the main reason many people don’t want more children.
They want to give the best to their first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally entitled to do so.
But like many Chinese, they have only insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social protection network, they argue, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West incorrectly view the one-child policy as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple’s first child.
Yes, we are being robbed of the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resources manager, said she wants a single child because she too was: “We were the center of our families and we were used to having everyone take care of us.
We’re not used to taking care of others and we don’t really want to take care of others.”
Chen Zijian, 42, owner of a translation agency, explained it more bluntly.
For parents with two careers, middle class, who lower the birth rate, he said, it’s about being successful enough to be selfish.
People in their 20s and 30s grew up watching their parents struggle during the early days of China’s experiment with capitalism and they don’t want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child requires a lot of time from parents, he said.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are questions of space, “they have to remodel their apartment,” and the strategic “has to have a curriculum prepared for the best daycares when the child is 9 months old.”
Most of his friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he said.
We don’t want to make too many sacrifices.
A UN group outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, characterized so far by defiant postures and mutual recriminations, grabbed renewed attention on Friday with the release of a document that envisions ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations carrying most of the burden on their shoulders in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as a major breakthrough in a negotiation that is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Developed by an ad hoc UN working group, the text does not talk about how much money rich countries would give the poor to cope with global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their coal production, and what the limit of the global temperature rise that political strategists would be willing to tolerate would be.
This gives the process a lot of flexibility, said John Coequyt, a senior representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN’s top climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as “the big picture.”
It shows the profiles for a possible agreement, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce their emissions over the same period by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, countries would cut emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also spurred talks on Friday, vowing to provide $3.6 billion annually over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
However, Friday was the same kind of verbal fireworks that dominated the conversations last week.
U.S. special climate envoy Todd Stern rejected claims calling for mandatory greenhouse gas emissions cuts for industrialized countries, compared to volunteers from major emerging economies, if they were not financed by the developed world.
The manoeuvre indicated that the Obama administration is taking a harder line with China, compared to what Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States will not make a deal without major developing countries moving forward and taking action, Stern said, adding that the text did not do enough to ensure the cuts could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his remarks an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei said the top U.S. climate negotiator lacked “common sense,” or was “very irresponsible” for saying earlier in the week that the U.S. would not help China economically cope with global overheating.
With the future economic trajectory of the world’s major powers at stake, fault lines have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States facing off on their respective obligations, while poorer nations insist that the world’s 24 most influential countries are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the most courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rican delegate, said it’s not surprising that major powers are arguing over who should pay for spending to limit greenhouse gases, even as vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in trying to hold large issuers accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is developing, said Ulate, who also works as a regional advisor on climate change in Mexico and Central America, for Conservation International.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most major participants say the talks will ultimately produce a political agreement.
The 43-member Alliance of Small Island States drafted a 24-page preliminary treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who leads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said pushing small island nations has “put political pressure on the entire political process,” in part because they are now unified and demanding action from emerging economies such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the exceptional issues before heads of government come to terms.
Senior officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and China’s vice minister, got off the planes and rushed into the halls of the Bella Center, to closed-door meetings and press conferences, to be able to delimit claims to be arbitrated over the next week.
The absolute disorder of the meeting (where every day 13,000 people enter and leave the convention center, the activists who play the guitar present nightly shows mocking the countries that they say are being sold, and preliminary proposals are passed hand-in-hand instead of via mail), poses a challenge.
Intensity just builds: Almost all the key ministers are here right now, and on Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, vice president for global conservation policy.
The heavyweights are coming.
The first train to 225 km / h from Britain redefines that feeling of Monday
At 5.13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle will pierce the darkness to signal a train departure that marks a revolution for travel in Britain.
The country’s first high-speed intercity train will reach 225 km/h, when it passes as lightning from Ashford, Kent, to St Panrcas Station in London, covering 93 kilometers in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of Transportation, will then be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes, aboard the first Javelin long-distance service outside London.
He hopes the new service will finally connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the major conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected remote areas would become prosperous suburbs, business travel times would be shortened, and the switch of planes and cars to the railroad would reduce national coal emissions, as well as ease congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three major political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears about environmental damage, can still curb Britain’s high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, will deliver its report to Lord Adonis on Dec. 30, the Times reported.
This will provide you with a detailed itinerary of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within a five-metre radius in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact may be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn up within a 25-metre radius of a definitive route.
HS2 is also expected to set three options for a wider high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will respond in spring.
The preferred option being proposed is a Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the West Midlands.
The line would be divided into or near Birmingham, with one branch heading west from the Penins to Manchester and Scotland, and another north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would enter Scotland.
“It looks like this will be the most beneficial option,” said one railroad member.
Once completed, travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first leg, which would not be inaugurated before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to just over a current hour.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at 402 km/h, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial track is designed to support trains of 400 meters in length, capable of carrying 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that a London terminal capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour would be needed.
Considering the capital’s space constraints, an existing station is expected to be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Experts in the railway industry argue that only St Pancras International or Euston Station offers that potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes the scheme should proceed, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean a final decision will not be made until after a general election.
Even if it starts up the work, the network would have to be built into sections.
Trains would initially be forced to leave the fast lines by existing lanes north of Birmingham, keeping travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is seen as the crucial point needed to ensure a change from planes to trains, a reference point for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers Face Mortgage for a Conservative’s $75,000 Orange
Alan Duncan, the Conservative Party spokesman, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange tree he built in his constituency home.
The party’s prison spokesman, who was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that MPs were living “from rations,” raised his mortgage by ?75,000 to build an oak-framed extension to his second home in Rutland.
They allowed him to charge the taxpayer the supplementary interest, adding hundreds of pounds a month.
Authorities in the House of Commons approved the requests at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who conducts a review of members’ expenses. Last night Mr. Duncan said the requests “could not be clearer or simpler.”
Mr. Duncan, one of the wealthiest Members of Parliament, owns a two-story house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
The nearby houses have been sold for almost a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fee office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the plans as an “orange tree.”
Neighbors described it as “a greenhouse for entertainment.”
Mr. Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the loan increase, during a recent House of Commons Standards and Privileges Committee investigation into his previous mortgage settlements.
Last month, the committee acquitted him of violating the rules, following an investigation of his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a 271,406-pound mortgage on his London property to his constituency home, which he had bought in 1991, the year before he became a deputy.
Documents released this week show that Mr. Duncan was applying for approximately 1,400 pounds a month in mortgage interest, as of March last year.
In April, their applications increased to more than $1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan’s Royal Bank of Scotland mortgage did not change at the time, suggesting that the entire increase was going to fund the 75,000-pound loan.
The BRE’s standard variable mortgage rate fell from 7.94% in December 2007 to 4% in March this year, the rate it is now.
The most recent document issued by the House of Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan was still requesting $1,250 per month in May.
Mr Duncan lost his job as Speaker of the House Opposition in September, after a covert reporter filmed him saying that deputies had to survive “from rations” after the spending scandal.
“Basically this is being nationalized, you have to live on rations and be treated like shit.”
He said: “I spend my money on my garden and apply for a small fraction based on what’s appropriate.
And I could ask for a lot more, but I don’t do it.”
The deputy, a millionaire for his former profession as an oil trader, was first questioned about his expenses in May, when it turned out he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the wage office that this “could be considered excessive.”
An activist dug a hole in Mr. Duncan’s lawn in the shape of the pound symbol after it was revealed that he requested 4,000 pounds for three years.
Last night, when asked about the mortgage increase, Mr. Duncan said, “It was for primordial improvements, approved both by the salary office and later by Legg.”
He added: “It’s not about evading and delinquency or breaking the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within bounds, according to the rules, authorized and everything.
It couldn’t be clearer or simpler in any way.”
Let those who have faith come to see the Brighton Beach Palapa Advent Calendar
The Brighton Palapas have found a new impetus for the winter months in an interactive Advent calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their palapas for each December day, using carols as their theme.
The event began on December 1, with guests who could see the last palapa from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, with filled cakes and punch served free.
The villains chosen so far include Vi Tres Barcos, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and The First Christmas, where the palapa presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid cleric from the Diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
He said: “We want religion to be more relevant to people, in a post-Christian society.”
"Why do we as Church expect people to come to an old strange building? I believe the Church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
“The idea of the palapa Advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends during a dinner party.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we’re trying to prove and represent that through spirituality.”
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of protesters on Saturday demanded an ambitious and binding agreement to fight global warming, around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested several hundred people.
Some 30,000 people, according to police; hundreds of thousands, according to organizers, paraded through the icy Danish capital in demand of an agreement that the United Nations Conference on Climate Change should reach by Friday, which would enter into force on January 1, 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, the growing climate mobilization around the world, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to the “political price” of a failure in Copenhagen being very high.
The incidents erupted shortly after the start of the demonstration in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, broke windows with pebbles and hammers, an AFP reporter reported.
The riot police intervened quickly and firmly.
Police announced the arrests of 600 to 700 people in total, according to her, especially members of the “Black Blocks”, ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, last April.
The coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of militants were detained "without distinction", underlining that a hundred of them "were immobilized on the street on Saturday night handcuffed and seated despite the intense cold".
The demonstration, which was quite peaceful, came out of Parliament and took to the Bella Center, the venue for the negotiations.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without attempting to enter.
A stage was erected to welcome the invited speakers. Former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candle vigil.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities, but numerous Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as were some Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, most with celestial rainbows, responded by forming a first morning rally in Copenhagen to call for Friends of the Earth to form “blue tides” for “justice and climate.”
Today we take to the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist with the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can’t keep saying: there’s time, said Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
In Africa, there are rivers that dry up, rivers that can be walked like never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalization, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "Today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific region, which brings together numerous islands highly vulnerable to warming, kicked off the demonstrations.
According to organizers, some 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, paraded dressed in red and wearing handkerchiefs with slogans in favor of solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, concentrations of hundreds of protesters were formed demanding vigorous action against climate change.
In France, demonstrations organized by the "350" network brought together hundreds of people, mainly in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people were concentrated.
Abkhazian separatist elected president, although Georgia denounces "fraud"
On Saturday, Abkhazia, Georgia’s pro-Russian separatist region recognized by Moscow more than a year ago, elected president; however, Tbilisi denounces “fraud.”
Some 131,000 people were summoned to participate in the first election after the Russo-Georgian War in August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another Russian-recognized Georgian separatist region.
The polling stations closed at 5 p.m.
According to officials of the Abkhazian Electoral Commission, the turnout was 58% a few hours before the closure.
The first provisional results would be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates in the race, including outgoing President Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which disapproved of voting.
This election is a farce.
Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili “regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under total Russian occupation,” his spokesman Manana Manjgaladze said.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
Following her separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict that ended several thousand deaths, Abkhazia tries to prove through this election that she is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, our new era as an independent state, said Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the electoral table at a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The topic of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large plates show Bagapch alongside the Russian president and prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, in different places in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, to the west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, warmly welcomed the Russian officials who came to control the development of the scrutiny.
In a brief ceremony, he said: We, the people of Abkhazia, are grateful for Moscow’s support, and very particularly, for the decision to recognize Abkhazia’s independence.
I hope that his country will be quickly recognized by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, raising his glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented in the election by former Vice President Raoul Khadjimba and two entrepreneurs, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as the one that cedes control of Abkhaz railways to Russia for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, argues that he does not support the current power or the opposition.
It takes a 50% majority plus one vote to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be organized two weeks later.
Climate: demonstrations in the world, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of the world to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, where police, on alert, detained more than 700 people around an imposing demonstration.
Some 30,000 people, according to police; hundreds of thousands, according to organizers, paraded in the afternoon in the cold of the Danish capital, which hosts until December 18 delegates from 193 countries, in search of an agreement that should enter into force on January 1, 2013.
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left Parliament and took to the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center, without trying to enter.
A stage was erected to welcome the invited speakers. Former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candle vigil.
A few moments after the demonstration began, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, broke windows with bricks and hammers, an AFP reporter reported.
The riot police quickly surrounded them and intervened firmly, throwing several of them to the floor.
Police announced the arrests of 600 to 700 people, saying they were mainly members of the “Black Blocks”, ultraviolent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, last April.
Late in the afternoon, a police officer was wounded in the jaw with a cobbler, and four cars were set on fire near a busy house during incidents that led to the arrest of about 20 people, according to police.
We didn’t take our eyes off extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned as law enforcement helicopters flew over the area.
Most of the protesters, who arrived by bus and train from the big cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, even Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present, as were some Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, most with celestial rainbows, responded by forming a first morning rally in Copenhagen to call for Friends of the Earth to form “blue tides” for “justice and climate.”
Today we take to the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist with the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

Oxfam along with former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, who was supposed to lead the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Asia-Pacific region, which brings together numerous islands highly vulnerable to warming, kicked off the demonstrations.
According to organizers, about 5,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, demonstrated in red dresses and wearing handkerchiefs with slogans in favor of solar energy in front of the city hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, concentrations of hundreds of protesters claimed to act against climate change were formed.
In France, demonstrations organized by the "350" network brought together hundreds of people, mainly in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).

The history and geography subject comes out reinforced by the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, stated in an interview that it will be broadcast in the Sunday News (JDD, according to his French acronym) that history and geography would come out "reinforced" by the reform of general secondary education, despite being eliminated from compulsory education in the second year of scientific baccalaureate.
From now on, all high school students will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
For the Minister, "enough with hypocrisy" because, according to him, "branche C is no longer a scientific branch", but "in general, it summons the best students".
The General and Literary Teaching branches cannot be sub-branches of the C, he goes on to underline even: "Neither did I hear that historians or intellectuals were outraged that they had eliminated history and geography in the second high school in technological schools."
An IFOP poll published Saturday in L'Humanité revealed that approximately seven out of ten French (69%) disapproved of the government's project to eliminate compulsory history-geography teaching in second grade C. Numerous intellectuals and teachers, the left and some right-wing elected representatives also criticized this fact.
Instead, the Minister added that “there is no talk” of removing philosophy from the C-secondary program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a mobilization day on Tuesday to protest against the project, which they say sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year they will give an admission test that will be aimed at their discipline, and at the end of the year, an admission test on their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
They will also practice in real conditions during the M2 year, after which they will be a first year in front of the classroom as teachers in internships.
If you do all the practices proposed prior to the contest, you will already have a great experience in front of the classroom, that is, more than 300 hours, he added.
Finally, the Minister points out that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
It also confirmed the project to remove the school map "before 2012."
At the Higher Normal School, experts will have 15 minutes to convincingly explain the evolution of the climate.
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen summit, a challenge that Jean Jouzel, vice president of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), accepted on Saturday morning at the Ulm Street Higher Normal School.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, inaugurated the conference round "Ernest", a day composed of a series of fifteen-minute expert presentations, filmed and open to the public, an AFP journalist reported.
We wanted to do something that appeals to people and convey the desire to know more, explained Edouard Hannezzo, 22, one of the organizers of this day called just as the students baptized the fish from the school pond.
We selected about twenty participants from among the experts in their discipline and selected them for their charismatic side, he said.
About global warming, “we can talk for hours, but we can also talk about key targets in a few minutes,” Jean Jouzel, who exposed without notes, but with the help of graphs in front of about fifty people, told AFP.
It’s part of our scientific role, he said, hoping the public will understand that “the Copenhagen conference is based on a very serious scientific record.”
Videos filmed during those conferences will be online on the school’s website starting Dec. 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Delay in payments: disgust among prison guards, action is expected
Prison guard unions on Friday called for a "general mobilization" to demand payment before holiday breaks, premiums and overtime, which was postponed until January for budgetary reasons.
The Prison Workers’ Force (2nd Guards Union) asked off-duty personnel to join the demonstration Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and “block” them to denounce the theft of their assets.
The CGT penitentiary (3rd union of the profession) calls them to "meet in general assemblies in the different prisons to achieve a mass mobilization", because it calls the failure to pay in December the "overtime, night premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October "shameful and unacceptable".
And the first union of guards, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for the general mobilization (...) in order to increase discontent and fury".
The Directorate of the Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime hours increased greatly in 2009 and not all were accounted for, but they assure that the balance will be paid in January.
At the end of the day, the Foreign Ministry reported that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guards unions guaranteeing that the payment would be made next month.
I do not doubt the efforts made by the staff for the functioning and modernization of our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I asked the Directorate of the Prison Administration to immediately implement a set of measures designed to ensure that this situation generated by a poor assessment of the number of overtime hours does not occur again in the future.
The December pay will then be low, except for management staff who enjoy the benefit of the famous premiums for functions and objectives, and who "always blame budgetary requirements," Ufap/Unsa lamented.
It is a real scandal, he said indignantly the interregional union FO of Marseille, announcing its decision to boycott until new order "all meetings and convocations".
The staff will not come to work on Sundays and corresponding holidays if those of the month of October are not paid in December, the same will happen with overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when our tasks and missions are increasing without taking on more personnel, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the salary of the staff, estimates the CGT penitentiary of Bordeaux.
According to trade unions, not all regions are the same, as some are luckier than others.
But anyway, the result is not as expected, said Ufap Secretary General Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama Says He Makes ‘Better Gifts’ Than He Receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first family Christmas at the White House, confessed to famed TV presenter Oprah Winfrey, who came to a simple conclusion about gifts: “I make better gifts than I get.”
During a special interview that ABC will air on Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle explain how they plan to celebrate the holiday season in their new prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be of the match.
Santa also loves Bo, Michelle Obama said, clarifying that the dog will "of course" receive a gift, according to excerpts from the show aired in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband’s claims about the quality of the gifts she receives: “No way, last year I gave you nice gifts,” she said provoking the president.
True, he was forced to admit it before humorously answering the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you that?"
During the hour-long interview, in a relaxed atmosphere with the famous cheerleader who devotedly supported Barack Obama’s presidential campaign, the president and his wife also recalled his favorite gifts from childhood.
Barack Obama remembered a two-speed bike as well as a basketball that his Kenyan father, whom he rarely saw, gave him for Christmas.
I remember that time when my father came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball, the president said.
Only many years later, I learned that he had given me that ball.
For her part, the First Lady remembered her dollhouse.
I had no idea how to organize a house, so I put all the furniture online against the wall, instead of accommodating them around the house, yet I loved that dollhouse, Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday Re-Operated, RTL Claims He's in an induced coma
Johnny Hallyday was intervened again in Los Angeles due to major “injuries” stemming from an operation in France, but the situation is “under control” according to his close associates, while RTL claims the singer was subjected to an induced coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker intervened again Wednesday night at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles where doctors found "injuries resulting from the operation" of a herniated disc in Paris on November 26, his press service in the same city said, indicating that the injuries "needed a repair operation."
However, the singer's press service tried to convey reassurance that the situation was "under control", and reported that a new medical part would be communicated within the next 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the singer's latest tour, Johnny Hallyday agreed, however, to be subjected to an induced coma to avoid "pain and complications".
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we’ll be more certain about their condition, RTL adds.
The press service, questioned by AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" no cannula would have been introduced to it after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on at the international clinic of Monceau Park due to a herniated disc.
The intervention, scheduled for a few days, was practiced by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux declined to comment on the information broadcast by RTL.
Singer Johnny Hollyday was admitted to Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for an infection resulting from Delajoux’s intervention.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday's, told RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through "a bad time," but said there was "no problem" because the rocker is "a fighter."
He called me just before he traveled to L.A., and I told him it was silly to fly twelve hours after such an operation, it’s not possible,” Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the musician's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, claimed to reassure him that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "controlled."
Camus said he had talked to Laeticia, the musician's wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concerns.
But the singer's health problems have multiplied since July when he was interned for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had been operated on a "colon cancer" after a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed, as planned, his long "Gira 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem is talked about exaggeratedly. Fanatics and journalists noticed the difficulty of the musician to move on stage.
In mid-November, his close associates even had to deny a new internment.
Euro-2009/short pool: Bousquet's first title at his favorite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a triple medallist at the 2009 World Long Pool Championships, won an international title on Thursday at a distance he feels particularly fond of, 50 m free, during Euro-2009 short pool in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition in which polyurethane swimmers last allowed themselves, only three world records were surpassed when in fact many more were expected.
One was enhanced by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by the Russian in relief 4 x 50 m 4 styles (male).
A shame for Bousquet, who coveted the world record in 50 m free, a brand he owns in long pool (20.94).
In one of the two queen swimming distances, in 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman won with 20''53 during a final where ten swimmers competed instead of eight as usual, an international first.
Bousquet overtook Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to bring down the world record (20.30), as planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I already said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try to achieve it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore polyurethane swimsuits that will be banned from January 1.
These swimmers, home to 238 world records since February 2008, finish their epic in Istanbul, where they competed for the first time in 1999 for the same test.
This time the use of swimmers did not help the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in long pool this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer failed to break his mark in the 400m freestyle (3:32.77), however, he won with the second best time of his career (3:34.55), against the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn’t give up completely in this race.
I knew I wasn’t going to be able to break a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and fulfilled my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough rival in the future, Biedermann said.
U.S.: A Sarcophagus Panel That Belonged to Zola Sold in $1.5 Million
A Roman sarcophagus panel owned by French writer Emile Zola sold for $1.5 million on Thursday, well above the estimated price, Sotheby's art dealer announced.
This panel 2 meters long by 63 cm high, dates from the third century after Christ, and its price had been estimated between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes, in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and drunken women, is an unusual piece, since there are only four or five in the world," Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions of ancient Rome and Egypt at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold in a hundred lots.
The sale continues, but so far, this lot was the highest bid by buyers, without a doubt, a Sotheby's spokesman, Dan Abernethy, told AFP.
Only a few days ago, it was discovered that marble was an acquisition by Emile Zola.
For almost 300 years, the panel was part of the famous Borges family collection in Rome, then appeared successively in the house of French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of his bathtub in his Parisian mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, Minister of the Third French Republic and President of the Council for a short time, before Marshal Pétain took power.
For about fifty years, his whereabouts were uncertain.
Reviewing the Louvre Museum’s database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of a “Emile Zola succession” opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of “Thérèse Raquin” and the fresco of the “Rougon-Macquart”.
Honduras aborts Zelaya’s departure to Mexico
Mexico on Thursday estimated that conditions were not given to transfer to its territory the overthrown president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, to whom the coup government denied the safe conduct.
At the moment, after a telephone conversation in the evening with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of carrying out the transfer, said the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.
The Mexican government plane that arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday to fly to Zelaya has returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate-General for Migration.
To grant him safe conduct, the coup government wanted to force Zelaya to “resign” and seek political asylum abroad.
But the ousted president refused because he wanted to come to Mexico as a guest acting head of state.
The coup government “suffered another defeat by asking me to step down ... they wanted me to file my resignation,” Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, where she has often made statements since the beginning of the five-month political crisis in the Central American country.
Here I can stay ten years, I have my guitar, added playing some chords the deposed president, refugee in the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy submitted a request for safe conduct, but unfortunately we were unable to accept it because it did not contain an asylum application, the interior minister of the coup government, Oscar Raul Matute, told Honduran radio station HRN on Wednesday.
I will not seek asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya replied in an interview on Telesur, whose headquarters are in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do so as president of the Honduran people.
Rumors about Zelaya's departure on Wednesday mobilized supporters of the deposed president, who gathered around Brazil's embassy, heavily besieged by the military.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the coup government’s position.
That reflects the marginal character of this government against international standards, he estimated.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuela’s socialist president Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he had organized a referendum to prepare for his re-election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the military and Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he returned surprisingly on September 21 and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested and will have to answer to justice for the crime of "high treason", according to the coup government.
The de facto president, Roberto Micheletti, managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
In the controversial election, Porfirio Lobo was elected. This election was recognized by the United States, but questioned by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted overwhelmingly against Zelaya’s return to power until her term ended on January 27.
Wall Street rises, U.S. trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed higher on Thursday, U.S. trade balance figures faithfully testify to the economic recovery of both the U.S. and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67%; and the Nasdaq, 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, and the Nasdaq, a technology component, 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The expanded Index Standard & Poor's 500 rose 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
We get good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this is anecdotal, he clarified, considering that the market was concentrated “in the half-full glass.”
For Avalon Partners’ Peter Cardillo, investors focused primarily on US trade balance figures, “reflecting an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit fell in October by 7.6 percent from September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the contrary, expected a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The big novelty is the growth in trade volumes, particularly exports of goods, which reflect the growth of the major economies they trade with the United States, said Christopher Cornell of research firm Economy.com.
In contrast, last week, unemployment registrations in the United States unexpectedly increased, with 474,000 applications submitted.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers “was the lowest in a year,” said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3.482% against 3.423% on Tuesday night, and the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose to 4.492% against 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: More than a hundred supporters of power beat the "Ladies in White"
On Thursday, hundreds of supporters of Cuban power beat up the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were summoned.
Some forty “Ladies in White,” wives or relatives of political prisoners, were assaulted in the street by supporters of Raul Castro’s government as they walked to the center of the capital demanding the release of those detainees, an AFP journalist said.
The Yankees are dying!, "Mercenaries!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raúl!"
The latter were escorted by officers dressed in civilian clothes who came to "protect" them.
The day before, a similar demonstration broke out against the “Ladies in White” in Havana, without injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to protest on Thursday for international human rights day, were arrested by police officers dressed in civilian clothes, an AFP reporter said.
Agents forcibly drove the dissidents into the vehicles who were booed by government supporters, according to the reporter.
In general, the arrest of dissidents in similar circumstances only lasts a few hours.
The "Ladies in White", awarded the 2005 Sakharov Prize by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to "request the release of all political prisoners", about 200 according to dissent, declared one of its leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Hector Maceda, is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, 53 of whom remain behind bars.
Cuban authorities call opponents “mercenaries” or “agents” on the pay of their declared enemy, the United States.
Rarely in the media, Cuban television reported on Thursday’s demonstration of government militants against the “counter-revolutionaries.”
Cuba, ruled by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of trampling on rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
An alien kills an octogenarian with a knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
An unbalanced man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and wounded five other people in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne on Thursday at the peak of the afternoon.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old aggressor allegedly struck an elderly man with two knives and for reasons not yet determined, in the pharmacy or in front of it at No. 85 Jean-Jaurès boulevard, police sources and witnesses said.
Following the serious injuries, the man born in 1929 died in the hospital, according to a senior official at the Alliance police union.
Then in the pharmacy or in front of it, he attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The husband, about thirty years old, intervened and was wounded.
The first two seriously injured victims were taken to the hospital where the elderly man died.
The life of the other injured, with the vital organs apparently affected, is in danger.
The pregnant woman then fainted and was admitted “in shock,” a police source said.
The gunman, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would have escaped through Jean Jaurès boulevard.
Apparently by chance, he would have injured two more pedestrians: a man in his thirties, and another in his forties severely.
At night, the scene of the crime was still unclear.
He was armed with two butcher's knives crossed on his back, an Alliance union official in the Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé, said at the scene.
Several passersby, including young people, tried to control the estranged, according to testimonies obtained by AFP.
I saw a guy in his 30s wearing a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn’t make it because the guy was strong, explained Alberto, a bartender from a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
On Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at 61, two municipal agents, including the chief, tried to arrest the gunman and were punched, according to police testimonies.
The events occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where numerous shops are located.
Some people came to tell me that there was a wounded man on the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the floor. Putting him in a safe position, I noticed a very important wound in the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person of about 35 years old arrived, with knife wounds.
National police arrested the man without identity documents.
The Nanterre Prosecutor's Office submitted the investigation to the jurisdiction of the Departmental Service of the Judicial Police of Altos del Sena (SDPJ 92).
The insane man was hospitalized Thursday night.
During his interim detention, he did not say a word.
A police source does not rule out the possibility of him being admitted to a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six policemen to dominate him at the Clichy police station where he was transferred.
He was "in a state of over-excitement" as "everything of this kind disturbed whose forces increase considerably under the effect of action."
U.S.: Polanski’s lawyer again calls for dismissal of the case
The lawyer of French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski again demanded on Thursday in Los Angeles, California, that the case be dismissed against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, for a case of sexual abuse that occurred more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, a lawyer for the director of The Pianist, reported serious procedural errors to three judges of the Second District of California Appeals Chamber at the time of the events in 1977.
Hummel stated: I complain that at this very moment the charges are dismissed, as the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, “was chilling.”
According to him, Judge Rittenband (deceased since then) would have talked to a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison, before passing sentence, which constitutes a serious lack of procedure.
This conversation was made public in the documentary "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired", from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But finally Wells declared in late September that he had "lie" the author of the documentary.
Hummel called for a trial that would allow him to present evidence of his argument in case the court rejected the dismissal of the case.
The indictment, for its part, reiterated the argument put forward in the first instance, namely that no dismissal of the charges could be seriously assessed until Roman Polanski was brought before the court.
The 76-year-old fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence for “illegal sex” with a 13-year-old girl was handed down.
Since then, he has never walked in the United States again.
Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski “has to be here to appear at the hearing.”
With this cause, we want to convey the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that there is a possibility of fleeing?
For her, the filmmaker "asks the court for a favor, even though he despises her authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to pronounce his sentence, also stressed "that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee".
Hummel was not the only one who asked to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer’s lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, to close the case.
She argues that her client no longer tolerates being harassed each time the Polanski case resurfaces, adding: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on an American arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was sentenced to house arrest at his cabin in Gstaad, awaiting possible extradition.
Wall Street loses its course and slows down by the rise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange closed aimlessly on Friday, in a market that struggles between better-than-expected indicators in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the Nasdaq, a technological component, lost 0.55 points to stand at 2,190.31 points.
The expanded Index Standard & Poor's 500 rose 0.37% (4.06 points), reaching 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains with narrow margins, the volume of exchanges is getting smaller and I think it will remain that way until the end of the year.
The trend continued thanks to the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators, which “helped to improve the market’s view of the strength of the economic recovery,” Charles Schwab analysts summarized.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November for the second consecutive month and higher than expected.
In addition, U.S. consumer confidence visibly recovered in December, from 73.4 to 67.4 the previous month, according to the University of Michigan’s preliminary index estimate.
However, the indices were curbed by a further advance of the dollar that reached the highest level in the last two months against the euro, which “takes down sectors sensitive to the economic situation,” explained Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3,540 percent from 3,482 percent on Wednesday night, and the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond to 4,497 percent from 4,492 percent the day before.
The choice of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of touring South Africa, the 112 Miss World title candidates are on the final line to fulfill their dream: to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
During this great celebration of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the surroundings of Johannesburg, five of them have already achieved their participation in the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss Athlete or even Miss Top Model during their stay in Africa.
It was a real stir.
It was extraordinary to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
“I saw so many things and had countless experiences!” said Miss Sierra Leone in amazement.
This competition, which is held for the ninth time in South Africa, will be broadcast live on Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 5:15 pm (15:00 GMT).
It is impossible to imagine a better country to deliver my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am very happy to have lived twice, notes Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the possibility of rediscovering "breathtaking African landscapes".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press conferences and safaris, the candidates for Miss World focus on the contest.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both converted into Bollywood stars.
Every woman’s dream is to be crowned as the most beautiful in the world, but it’s not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown,” says Miss India with a big smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional dresses and, of course, with a swimsuit.
Chinese host Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean, and Miss World committee leader Steve Douglas will lead the event.
South Africa has proven to be able to welcome the world with warmth and pride that is hard to match, said Julia Morley, president of the Miss World contest.
Like last year, the candidates took a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
As an exceptional event, they met the South African president, Jacob Zuma, who shook their hand.
Unusual for a head of state, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
His best memory will undoubtedly be the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the 2010 World Cup, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I dealt with people I never thought I'd get to meet.
Probably back for the 2010 World Cup, says enthusiastic Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
News about Johnny Hallyday 'very positive', says son David
News about Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," his son David said Friday when he arrived at the Los Angeles airport to accompany his father, who had been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going great, David Hallyday told reporters as he got off the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 1 p.m. local time (21:00 GMT).
The singer's son, distended, said he would move "as soon" to Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday entered Monday due to an infection resulting from the herniated disc operation on November 26 in Paris.
The musician is “in a coma that has been induced since that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment,” the news service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already undergone a coma induced by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where he entered Monday due to an infection, the aftermath of a herniated disc operation last November 26 in Paris.
The singer was operated once again on the night of Wednesday to Thursday because of serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia went Friday morning to the French high school in Los Angeles, attended by her daughter Jade, to witness a school event, an AFP photographer confirmed.
The head of orthopedic surgery and traumatology at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to Los Angeles on Monday to be with the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer last November 26 at the international private clinic of Monceau Park in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Camus said.
There is talk of a possible lawsuit, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus argued that Johnny Hallyday had "traveled too fast to Los Angeles with the authorization of the Parisian surgeon".
I spoke directly with the doctor and was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem in making the trip, as I was operated twice on a herniated disc, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he said that the singer had apparently "gone without cannula, without anything" after his Paris operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
She operated actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where Delajoux was working at the time.
In 2007, she also intervened with actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma formed as a result of a brain hemorrhage.
It is a doctor with a bad reputation, convicted by justice on several occasions for malpractice, as well as for tax fraud and scam.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the Order of Physicians, accused him of being "an unscrupulous man" sued "regularly" before the Council of the Order, and is "far from being advisable."
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention "was carried out without any inconvenience" and that the results of the postoperative studies were "normal".
The operation “could not cause bleeding and therefore needed no drainage,” he added.
Anyway, the singer’s tour, whose health problems have multiplied since the summer, went into parenthesis.
Resuming the tour on Jan. 8 as planned seems very risky to me, Camus said.
The UDF Association raises the tone and warns the New Center about the use of its acronym
The association UDF (Union for French Democracy), controlled by the MoDem (Democratic Movement) of François Bayrou, reacted on Friday to the attempt of the president of the New Center, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Public Offering of Procurement) on the acronym of the former Giscardista party, inviting him to withdraw it from all support, on pain of being sued.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to regain the acronym UDF, since he believes that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political heritage after having stretched his hand to the left.
On the other hand, the Minister of Defense, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
In support of its management, it received the help of deputy Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, current NC) who claims ownership of the UDF brand, as he was the first to register it at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the office of the UDF association, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to issue a request to the Minister and the deputy, urging them to give up the acronym and transfer the rights to the property of the brand, under penalty of legal action.
In recent days, you have made many statements implying that you were going to propose to your political movement to regain the acronym UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Centrist Alliance.
They also believe it is correct to continue with the use of the movement's name, the Nouveau Centre, and the slogan "Today's UDF" in their militant material and on the presentation page of their site, the letter's signatories maintain.
As you already know, they have no right to use the acronym, explains the UDF office which requires the NC to immediately remove the mention of the UDF name from all media, as well as from (its) website.
It also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the ownership of (the) mark to the legitimate rightful."
Failure to do so will appeal to justice to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In the letter, they point out that the UDF "is a real political movement since 1978" and recall that Morin and his friends "choose" to leave in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP".
Therefore, the New Center does not, according to them, have any right to use the acronym UDF.
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office charged with defending "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he registered the trademark", he was no longer "a member of the UDF for three years", but of the UMP.
Scandalously and fraudulently take advantage of the absence of registration of the acronym UDF to do it on your own.
This indiscretion is turning into a crime, they denounce, before mocking the NC strategy: "We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make your own name than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name you are not entitled to."
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier to be tried for weakness abuse
On Friday, the Nanterre Court decided to sue artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as billionaire Liliane Bettencourt’s daughter claims, she took advantage of the octogenarian’s state of weakness to strip her of a portion of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars of the show, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime whose conviction consists of a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a €375,000 fine.
This means that in this case there will be a process worthy of a saga about one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter dispute the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But Correctional Court No. 15 also ordered Liliane Bettencourt, 87, to undergo a medical examination by three medical professionals.
The heiress and main shareholder of L’Oréal has always refused to submit to such examinations, even more so under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor’s Office during the investigation.
Doctors appointed on Friday should submit a report before March 10, 2010 stating whether and for what periods Liliane Bettencourt suffered from weakness.
I think he'll take it.
"I'm going to talk to her," Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said as he left the hearing.
For his part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, was pleased with the court’s decision.
It’s excellent news...The expert opinion will show that he (Banier) manipulated this older lady, whom we must protect,” he said.
For two years now, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has filed criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a multifaceted photographer and artist, accusing him of taking advantage of her mother’s weakness for years to obtain a billion euros in donations, through checks, life insurance contracts or works of art.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a long-time friend.
On Friday, as the court examined the provenance of the lawsuit brought by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers’ allegations turned out, on some occasions, to be a large family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt’s lawyer took into account three letters her client had sent (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary in which she said she was suspicious of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers’ husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, “I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier between once and twice a day for fifteen years.
Since her wedding, I have never been able to talk to Françoise again.”
For its part, the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office once again considered that the plaintiff was not in a position to appear, especially since a guardianship judge has refused, in recent days, to make room for her request to open a judicial guardianship procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to appear in court, is not under guardianship and has no guardian.
No other person will be able to appear in his place,” said Attorney General Marie-Christine Daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that it would rule on the admissibility of Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Management revolution or the end of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain.
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies with respect to their employees reminds us of the position of companies with respect to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about employees adhering to "values" determined from above as before it was about imposing products designed by factory technicians on consumers.
By putting the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution gave way to the strategies of conquering the markets... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that have no relation to the customer’s preference factors is repeated regularly.
A demobilization of employees can end in a deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially R&D and, even more so, business intelligence.
Indeed, BI (Business Intelligence) "requires all parties involved ... to conduct themselves proactively and have a forward-looking outlook"; it requires employees to commit themselves to a commitment that is completely opposed to the recommendations of an authoritarian leadership.
For this reason, we called for a managerial revolution, which would consist of putting employees at the center of the company’s concerns as well as the customer.
Internal opinion polls have a relative utility
Will internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire conducted by Orange among its employees, incite a managerial revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
-In principle, because I could verify that, faced with a new situation, and after many laps, all the companies end up doing essentially... what they always did! B989
Secondly, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
- Lastly, because most managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As they come from the great schools of engineers, they interpret psychology in a mechanistic way.
They adopt, for intellectual convenience, the old behaviorist theory that American “neurosciences” recently revived, and that the Institutes of Studies and the media widely spread behind their backs.
In this way, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the "commands" (sic) of executive engagement, a recent Ipsos research published on Le Figaro.fr reaffirms managers in a mechanistic management posture, unsuitable to today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies involves adopting a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists of integrating into any business management reasoning or practice, a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means to make a reality part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only studies from Motif Functional Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
Studies have shown that they judge their company based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of mobilisation factors, business managers can monitor, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and relocate human resource management "in place".
In this way, they create a favorable ground for the organized development of a strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo speech: for the "fair war" Obama receives praise from the right
On Friday, the American right, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize has defended the concept of “just war” against America’s enemies, hailed Obama’s speech on Thursday.
Conservatives, who had discredited the award’s handover to Obama on Oct. 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate during the 2008 election.
I loved what she said, said Mrs. Palin, a leading figure in the right wing of the Republican Party, to USA Today, adding that she herself had addressed the “sometimes necessary” issue of war in her recently published memoirs.
In my opinion, war is, of course, the last thing Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
Terrorists must be stopped, he said.
Obama, who inherited the two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, devoted himself Thursday in Oslo to justifying the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, considered that the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really good, the former speaker of the House of Representatives rejoiced, who appreciated in particular the mention of “the existence of evil in the world” in the presidential words.
At times, the speech seemed very historic to me, Gingrich said, during an interview on the radio show “The Takeaway.”
The former elected representative, whom some consider a potential Republican inauguration candidate for the 2012 presidential election, was pleased to hear “a leftist president” reminding Nobel Committee members “that they would not be free and could not deliver a peace prize if the use of force did not exist.”
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush’s speeches and current Washington Post columnist, Obama delivered “a very American speech.”
In addition to presenting himself as a “citizen of the world,” as he “always does,” he “spoke like an American president” by reminding Europeans “that they live in a security bubble that they didn’t create and that they don’t do much to preserve it,” Gerson said.
Among the unconvinced right-wing few, a Bush-era hawk, former U.N. ambassador John Bolton, called the speech "monotonous, pretentious and uninspired" on the National Review Online website.
To the president’s left, Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the slaughter of innocents, he warned.
However, the center-left press praised the president.
Los Angeles Time, while still believing that Obama received the Nobel Prize prematurely, called his speech "super-production" especially for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech “should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression,” the newspaper said enthusiastically.
Obama “pronounced the speech that was necessary,” the New York Times said, judging him “at once bleak and uplifting.”
Road transport: three marathon negotiations to ensure Christmas supply
After three sessions of marathon negotiations, the road trade unions and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only employers' organization that remained until the end, reached an agreement on Friday afternoon that ends the slogan of strike and the threat that falls on the Christmas supply.
During the signing session on Friday night, Transportation Secretary Dominique Bussereau “rejoiced” over the deal, following several negotiating sessions that began Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, negotiators said goodbye at dawn on Friday in the hopes of quickly signing the agreement text late in the morning.
Even though three employer organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew giving a door.
But a more than six-hour meeting that began at 11 a.m. was necessary for everyone to agree and the text to be signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict “would have been very damaging to businesses” and “was feared to disrupt the holiday season,” Bussereau said.
The text foresees a 4% increase for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
The hourly rate goes up from 8.72 euros to 9.06 for low wages.
It’s not much, but we started with a lot of disadvantage, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
If so, we will give the order to our militants that there be no more cuts or blockades in the supply centers.
But there may always be some disgruntled rebels, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that this is "a good deal", although it was "difficult to grant increases to high wages in view of international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It’s a common-sense deal that respects wage earners, Maxime Dumont (CFDT) said, while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as “a historic deal.”
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) it is “an acceptable compromise.”
The agreement also foresees an increase in travel costs of 3% and the holding of general assemblies of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will mainly allow to address the issue of an extraordinary payment and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a decrease of 100 million euros in employers' burdens" was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 rectification finance bill, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote “on the same terms.”
The TLF signature allows the agreement to apply, firstly, to companies that are members of this organization and, secondly, to the entire profession, in case the Minister of Labour makes an extension.
It will be done “as soon as possible,” Bussereau said.
Opposition from employers’ organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced that it was a "naive business", since the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the CO2 tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but so as not to upset those who wish to eat turkey at the next Christmas dinner, Unostra lamented.
The agreement puts “the stability of many SMEs in the sector during the next 12 months” at risk.
RER A: conflicts over the weekend, unions disagree with the proposals of the RATP
Conflicts on RER A, France’s largest urban public transport line, will continue over the weekend, because at Friday’s meeting, the 2nd day of strike between unions and the RATP leadership, there was no agreement and the unions were dissatisfied with their request for the premium.
For this important holiday shopping weekend, on Saturdays and Sundays trains will only run between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m., with one train out of every two on the central stretch (between La Défense and Nation) and one train out of every four on the other lines.
Interconnection with the SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, forcing passengers to change trains.
The Lafayette Galleries, which expect 200,000 customers each day, were pleased that “RATP strives to serve large stores.”
The RER A crosses the Parisian city from West to East.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains operated at peak hours, and almost no trains operated at valley hours, as had been planned.
On Thursday there was no disorder on the platforms thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the Island of France.
In this way, at dawn, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, mainly due to the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had risen “an hour and a half earlier to arrive on time.”
Saint-Lazare station was not saturated, said the SNCF, which had provided for the supervision of police and law enforcement.
The RER As operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station to join the metros.
New general assemblies of striking workers will take place on Saturday and Sunday. The results will be analyzed, "unsatisfactory" according to the unions, of a meeting that was held with the management on Friday afternoon.
The director of the RERs proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects for the RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
That’s not what drivers who claim a premium owed to them want, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts its premium proposals in parentheses, the CGT said indignantly, noting that the management "was not able to solve a problem that the SNCF and the road sector had already solved".
A new meeting is planned on Monday to conduct "a more extensive analysis on the conditions of exercise of the profession," the RATP said.
Which also led unions to say the company “didn’t care about weekend users.”
In the morning, about 150 drivers stormed a committee at the headquarters in Paris.
Then the management, who until then had refused to dialogue during the strike, suggested the meeting “to calm the waters.”
The conflict could spread to RER B on Tuesday, after Unsa and the Independents filed a notice.
The unions ask for a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants) and complain about the degradation of working conditions on this line that has a million passengers daily.
The drivers of RER, all in the second degree of their professional career, charge from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and from 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for hours with alternating shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish judiciary dissolves pro-Kurdish party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled on Friday in favor of the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that immediately sparked angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community, in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just extended a hand to the Kurdish community trying to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society (DTP) party was dissolved because it had become the “focus of activities that undermined the independence of the state and its indivisible unity,” Court President Hasim Kiliç told reporters after four days of deliberations.
The decision by the 11 judges was unanimous, although it only took a seven-vote majority to get the dissolution, Kiliç said, adding that 37 of the party's leaders, including its president Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, are separated from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the cessation of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the party’s assets by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders warned before the verdict that deputies would leave parliament before being parliamentarians without a party label.
The decision follows a procedure launched by Supreme Court prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya in 2007, which accuses the DTP of obeying the “principles” of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Numerous observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
However, the party claims it has no “organic ties” to the PKK, but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court’s verdict comes as the government lends a hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen their rights, so that the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and thus end the conflict.
DTP leaders said a dissolution could lead to heightened tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where a large number of demonstrations against the detention conditions of PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan have degenerated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of protesters have gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the large southeastern city mostly populated by Kurds.
Law enforcement threw tear gas grenades and used water cannons, while protesters threw Molotov bombs or sledged stones.
In Istanbul, about a hundred people were also concentrated.
After the verdict, Türk said the court’s decision would “deepen the discouragement.”
Turkey cannot resolve this issue by dissolving a party, he told reporters.
The government, made up of a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
In principle, we oppose the closure of parties.
That way nothing is solved, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision completely boycotts the democratic openness launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack in which seven soldiers were killed three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the bloodiest attacks in recent months.
Snow can start suddenly.
A truly cool winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
It is not something with which you want to make life impossible for citizens, says the director of road maintenance in winter of the EDF
But with it, your employees can learn to test and master the entire vehicle technology.
This weekend, meteorologists may be announcing it for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of the snow and ice.
In this case, the EDF shall act in accordance with a detailed plan.
As soon as it snows profusely in Frankfurt and temperatures drop below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called A stretches come out with large salted vehicles, explains Brauburger.
These include, for example, major arteries and avenues such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also the accesses for the fire department, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloped sections, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
EDF service starts around three in the morning
They should be covered approximately 1,040 kilometers, as needed, in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which adheres better.
That’s why the FES starts around three o’clock in the morning, “with it the tracks are free until rush hour traffic begins”.
The hard part is when it starts to snow around 7:30 a.m.
“Then we have a problem,” says the director of winter road maintenance, “because then no one is ready to clear space for salted vehicles.”
Immediately after, when it is no longer snowing, it is up to the secondary and private roads, to which the Rat-Beil-Straße also belongs.
The last priority is the side and side streets.
That's where the inconvenience comes in, Brauburger knows.
Around five o'clock in the morning the FES infantry is launched, mainly dangerous spots and cruise ships are cleared.
Generally, the EDF would not be able to take over all the bike lanes.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 10 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. does not lose sight mainly of the bridges, says Brauburger.
As these become slippery quickly, the salted vehicle starts as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
In case of emergency, the police can also call them.
The cradle of the dinosaur
The Tawa trocae looked the same as many other carnivorous dinosaurs: a two-metre-long, 1.50-metre-high animal that ran on both strong hind legs, had an elongated head with sharp and curved teeth, short arms with sickle-shaped claws, and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple of million years later, it would not have been something special.
But the Tawa juntae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in Thursday's Science magazine.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which at the time was in a dry area of the supercontinent Pangea on the equator.
Tawa opened a new window into the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about the genealogical relationships, propagation and characteristics of the first dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists began an excavation at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico in 2006.
Sometimes, we have found in a day a dozen dinosaur bones, this is something unprecedented for Triassic sediments, reports Randall Irmis, a team member at the Utah Museum of Natural History.
The researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation, the remains of five specimens were collected in total.
Finding confirms theories about ancient dinosaur history
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an exceptional finding: "Triassic dinosaur fossils are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not share such enthusiasm at all.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
But many of the older fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these early dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, experts debate, for example, when the saurians were divided into their three most important genealogical lineages: the carnivorous theropods among which are the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the quadruped sauropods known as "long-necked" and their relatives, and the Ornithisauer to herbi.
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa trocae is a primitive theropod.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
For example, in the skull of Tawa researchers found evidence of air pockets, such as those also possessed by theropod descendants, birds.
Thanks to air bags, birds breathe more efficiently than mammals.
In the case of Tawa also the bones of the spine were evidently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive airbaged theropod, Randall Irmis says.
Because the related line of later giant sauropods also possessed air bags and light bones, it was likely that the common ancestors of both groups already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs so far known lived in South America, researchers infer that saurians first emerged there.
Consequently, the three genealogical lineages were separated at first and spread from South America to all corners of the Earth, which at that time still formed a single land mass, the supercontinent Pangaea.
However, facts say the team found along with Tawa the remains of two other theropods not closely related.
All three cannot be descended from a single related ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three waves migrating to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the Science study.
Of course, there are also opponents.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, comments Bonn-Martin Sander paleontologist.
Their opinion could give a distorted image, because simply in South America many dinosaur fossils are still preserved, while in other continents there is hardly anything to discover.
The question of how dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare collateral line of reptiles to Mesozoic dominant land vertebrates remains an enigma.
Meanwhile, in the Triassic, dinosaurs still shared their living space with many other reptiles, for example, with the ancestors of current crocodiles and pterosaurs and with many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassic, dinosaurs expanded across the world and many new species developed, while kinship became extinct at the Triassic boundary to the Jurassic.
Success stories were not eternal.
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
It could have been a mass extinction that dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they were able to beat the opponents in the area.
Successful stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, a meteor impact brakes the rise of a group of species, which had also evolved in the Triassic and since then had a miserable existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the international signatories.
Participants include professors from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, California.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen participate.
The police eviction of the busy Goethe University casino in Frankfurt has reverberated around the world.
278 professors and professors from Goethe University, but also from higher education institutions throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, stand in solidarity with students protesting at the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "reject" the police eviction promoted by the board of directors.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the university, evicted the building occupied by students and teachers on an educational strike last week because the walls and artworks were covered with propaganda.
As a result, five students were injured.
The material damages, the signatories judge, do not justify “the violent dissolution of the courses organized by the same students and professors by a police command.”
The eviction represented an “unacceptable attack” on freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive focus on vandalism served to “delegitimize and criminalize protest” and diverted attention from content.
The Board of Directors has refused to enter into the necessary negotiations.
Teachers demand the immediate withdrawal of the legal claim.
Most of the occupants have not caused material damage, it is said.
Legitimized protest
The young people of the Verdi union and the German Federation of Trade Unions also stand in solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of a growing concern for one’s future, says Verdi’s national youth secretary Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Hessian Minister of Science, however, defended the actions of the university rector and the police.
We are grateful to the Rector of the University.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, he said in an Aktuelle Runde broadcast Thursday at the parliament building in Wiesbaden province.
We are sympathetic to the protest, but we are not sympathetic to the vandalism, said Peter Beuth, CDU delegate to the provincial parliament.
The views of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the left, are different.
The CDU used painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, Janine Wissler (Left) said.
Instead of studying the students’ arguments and demands thoroughly, they are evicted.
The Left has tabled a motion, in which the Minister of the Interior is asked to submit a report on the police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a heavily guarded site for secret arms research.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Here are important research and production centers of micro and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have contacted the Riedberg headquarters in Frankfurt, university institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
Several visits were made to each other and now, on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg sign a “Tight Collaboration Protocol” in Frankfurt.
Deputy Moscow Mayor Juri Rosljak and Selengrad Mayor Anatoly Smirnov led the Russian delegation; for Frankfurt signed the head of planning services Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010 FIZ representatives and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises of the natural sciences research center will travel to a seminar in Selenograd.
Scientific exchange
This is an ongoing scientific exchange.
But it also deals with business relations.
FIZ companies will have the opportunity to set foot in the growing Russian market.
In return, Russian scientific companies want to have access to contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is home to important Russian companies and research institutes.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large Sitronics consortium and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "Socialist Planning City" for armament research.
Selenograd (literally translated as "Green City") was named after the forested mountain landscape, in which research facilities were established.
Brakes from Stuttgart
The Stuttgart 21 Dimension is not high enough at all.
For the supporters of the project it is simply and plainly "the new heart of Europe".
The S21 law is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which will precipitate the capital of the Banden-Württemberg region a decade of chaos of irreparable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with rails, which end up in the middle of the city, were then considered 19th century engineering fossils, which acted as brakes of modern rail traffic, since in the past it took a huge amount of time to hook the locomotives back and forth.
Roll, stop dry continue the journey; but so it must be done.
And that’s why the terminals had to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a pass station, which is about halfway between the trans-European lines of operation between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan of "Heart of Europe".
The S21 will really be started, even though the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost priceless to implement the reduction.
Railway terminals of course also have no more problems of entry and exit, since there are reversible locomotives with tractor unit and driver's carriage at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new built section of ICE towards Ulm will already be started.
Federal and communal politicians have put it that way.
The railway continues, also because the risks of the Republic’s large individual infrastructure projects are carried by the taxpayer and not the state.
From an urban point of view, the project is still justified to some extent.
New urban space is created, provided with many green areas, probably from the designer’s computer-generated graphics.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The crossing station and road support are designed for the transport of people, which was attributed to the enormous growth typical of the 1980s.
At that time, there was no competition for low-cost flights.
But modern transport policy must first be concerned with strengthening freight transport, since rail transport is considerably greener than that carried out by trucks on the roads.
However, the new sections under construction are good for freight trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affects many other railroad projects.
More than six billion euros must be buried in the Zuavos.
That's the official figure.
Experts consider it to be more realistic between ten and fifteen billion.
It is certain that in the next decade the money will be missing in other narrow crossings and passages on the net.
A total of 60 major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of more than 180 kilometers of long rails through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, the slow-moving track has been built.
It would be urgent here to step on the accelerator properly.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The Rhine Valley section will be the bottleneck for international freight transport: through the heart of Europe.
The government is considering the ruling on the airport.
The federal government leaves pending in the regional parliament of Wiesbaden, if it is going to file an appeal to the ruling on the ban on night flights of the administrative court of Hesse.
The CDU/FDP coalition appears to have commissioned legal experts to investigate the 400-page VGH ruling, Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) said.
The administrative court in Kassel had at this date given written reasons that in the case of the construction of the planned northwest airstrip at Frankfurt Airport, the federal state would have to re-regulate the ban on night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as foreseen by the federal government, would not be reconcilable with the mandatory legal protection of the population from noise due to air traffic.
The coalition will have to decide by January 4 whether to file the appeal against this sentence.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pressured government representatives to renounce the appeal before the nation’s Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect their promises of a ban on night air traffic, which they had made before the elections.
It’s quite difficult, if one is allowed to keep one’s word, Green leader Tarek Al-Wazir said, referring to the FDP slogan “We keep our word.”
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel’s recrimination, which the federal government would be attempting through misrepresentations of the law and tricks still getting its night flights.
A thorough legal investigation would take a long time.
The coalition would not want to act on the basis of a “quick first impression”.
We need a legally flawless decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
Just as the opposition represents it, it would never have been the claims of its group about the ban on night air traffic.
Banks in the U.S. are paying back their loans.
The big American banks shaken by the crisis are stripping away their state bonds.
The “Bank of America” gave back at once the aid it had been provided by the bank bailout fund Tarp of a total of 45 billion (approximately 30 billion euros).
The Citi group also plans to return state aid, according to a report by CNBC.
With this the institutes intend to free themselves from the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of the money, such as the limitation on the payment of bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high fees.
The "Bank of America" had obtained approximately 19 billion cash through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum was taken from the box itself, which had enough means, among others for the sale of items.
Banking director Kenneth Lewis thanked U.S. taxpayers on Wednesday night: the financial injection helped overcome very difficult times.
The banking house had miscalculated the investment bank’s absorption effort at the climax of the financial crisis.
The Citi group also aims to raise money in the capital market to be able to free itself from its obligations to the state.
CNBC reported from well-known circles that the U.S. bank could announce by Thursday the increase of its capital by 20 billion dollars.
A representative of the Citi Group declined to comment.
By June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had returned their aid.
Quick Election
In the end, everything was faster than you thought.
Just two weeks after the board of the ZDF (German TV channel) pressured editorial chief Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel may introduce a successor.
Last night the guild wanted to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of the ZDF’s Berlin main studio.
There was no confirmation of this from the station, officially so as not to anticipate the procedure.
But it certainly also influenced the fact that ZDF director Markus Schächter was no longer harmed, if this proposal was also not approved by the board.
Schächter’s candidate Frey needs the support of nine of the 14 guild members.
The result of the vote was not yet finalized at the close of this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed on the board with his proposal to renew the contract of Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's removal was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
Because the majority of the Union in the administrative council already weeks before the election had indicated that they were not going to support Brender in his post.
The opposition against the editor-in-chief had been organized by the president of the Hesse government, Mr. Roland Koch.
He declined another term from the prestigious newsroom chief with the argument, that under Brender's direction the ZDF news reports would have lost audience ratings.
Until shortly before the elections there were protests because of this, in which political influence over the ZDF was scourged.
In the end, 35 public law specialists had even meddled in the debate, who called Koch’s proceedings unconstitutional.
But it didn't help.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romanesque philology.
He then worked at the station "Südwestfunk" and at the newspaper "Frankfurter Rundschau".
In 1983 it was changed to the ZDF, in principle to the informative "journal-journal".
The following stations: 1988 to 1990 personal speaker of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and conductor of the morning program "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 director of foreign policy of the ZDF; since then director of the study of the ZDF in the capital.
The Greens' political party announced a constitutional demand following the dismissal of Brender, who was elected as journalist of the year Wednesday by the media magazine "Medium Magazin".
Koch’s opponent on the board, the president of the Rhineland-Palatinate government, explained last week that the federal states should change the state agreement of the ZDF in such a way that the director’s staff proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
A withdrawal of political supporters from the ZDF’s control guilds was ruled out by Beck.
Brender's likely successor, Mr. Peter Frey, was recommended to the board with a smart move: he strongly criticized the guild for Brender's dismissal.
Thanks to this test of journalistic independence both Schächter was able to appoint him to the post of editor-in-chief without losing his face, as the administrative council was able to vote for him, without falling under the suspicion of giving the post to a supporter-in-chief.
In the calculations of the parties Frey is awarded anyway to the left liberals.
College careers are exploding
Partial success for students: after a year of education-related strikes, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the federal states finally gave in. In a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university rectors, both sides agreed to try to improve the conditions of study in the cases of undergraduate and master.
Students in the future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the test load: basically each module of the race must end with a single exam.
In addition, the aim is to examine the workload of students, and to ensure a "real and justifiable measure".
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of exam results between universities within and outside Germany.
The federated states are committed to more flexibly crafting the structural rules together for Bachelor and Master careers.
Regulations of the federated states that diverge from this, should no longer exist.
Fewer exams
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Culture and the rectors of the universities have been constantly talking about the improvement of being able to carry out and successfully complete a career (studyability).
Now for the first time there was talk of a specific content.
The so-called accreditation council agreed to drastically reduce the number of exams: "Each module ends with a single exam", says a 30-page document, which aims to partially regulate the approval of university careers.
The "significant reduction in exam load" is intended to prevent development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect studyability, explained the director of the accreditation board, Reinhold Grimm.
Moreover, in the future "studyability" must be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
Modules and content should be thoroughly examined for unnecessary restrictions on students’ choice of..
the courses.
Students would have "the right to get more spaces, which enable and encourage self-initiative."
These rules would apply to new races, but also to the examination of existing races.
These must be "recredited" again every five years. But this would mean, that it would take until 2015 to examine all the races.
Those responsible for this would be country-wide 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the accreditation board, which is installed by the federated states.
The ministers of education and culture urged the federal states in October to influence the agencies in such a way that the amount of subjects and exams are not too strict or demanding.
In some states universities and technical schools have already agreed with ministries to adopt such measures.
So far only Rhineland-Platinate has said it provides additional means for the further development of the Bologna process.
With this money, universities must implement student mentoring and counseling programs, as well as strengthen examination offices and abroad.
The federal government and universities intend to have 10 million euros available for these purposes.
In early 2010 the government wanted to bring a university law novel to parliament.
According to her, a single exam should be sufficient for the completion of a career model.
The configuration of the career should be made more flexible, in addition to ensuring the recognition of assessments in other universities and facilitating accessibility to the Master.
Until the end of next year it is intended to examine all careers about its "studyability".
On Thursday, the government and the opposition again discussed the conditions for studying in the federated state.
Apart from the praise, there was also criticism about the decisions.
At the federal level board of university groups Juso (young socialists) demanded that the configuration of education policy should no longer be carried out "behind closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the education strikes, now students as the main ones involved should be able to comment as well.
The president of the university board of rectors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave her support to the students: “We need the experience of the students,” she said Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with whom HRK deliberated on a joint reform document.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) the Bonn agreements were not quite enough: the union demands a legal right for every student with the Bachelor degree the possibility of accessing a subsequent Master’s career.
In addition, the federal states have to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor’s students there will be in the future enough places for Master’s studies with the best possible study conditions, as reported by a member of the GEW, Mr. Andreas Keller.
The federal government has to hire a lot more teachers.
But about greater access to the master's degree, the Ministers of Education did not comment.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
“Going in and out of Germany is virtually unchecked,” says the first line of a poem by lyricist Werner Söllner in unbalanced language fragments, in which he thematizes the experiences of arrival in Germany lived by a dissident, who gained his freedom but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked initially as a German and English teacher in Bucharest, and then as a reader in a children’s book publishing house, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner was given several literature awards, in 1993 he gave the memorable lessons or talks of poetry in Frankfurt at Goethe University, and since 2002 he is director of the literature forum in Hesse at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He gave enough speech last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the disfigured mirror of its Security files"
Visibly insecure and embarrassed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted participation as an IM in the Romanian Secret Service Securitate in front of fellow German-Romanian writers, among others Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present in 1989, Söllner had received the German Language Award.
Attempts at recruitment had begun slowly in early 1971.
"Therefore I am someone who did not defend himself sufficiently in the face of security's attempts to provoke fear," Söllner said.
Lyricist Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the awarding of the Nobel Prize in literature to Herta Müller and its unparalleled literary controversy with the mechanisms of dictatorial domination, the literary scene and especially the community of German authors from Romania are shaken by a case that evidences the abysses and evil of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we know, not only an author, but also a victim.
In his IM Security case Walter had played a role, said literary scientist Michael Markel after Söllner’s confession, and stressed the positive influence for him of IM Walter.
He had excused or defended him on all the difficult points for him, Markel said.
“I feel the moral need to make this claim,” he said.
Söllner’s statement in this form and in front of this audience was unexpected, the confession of a former dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, not so surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable haven for Spitzel-Security spies, Herta Müller wrote as early as July in the weekly "Zeit", after reading her own 914-page file.
Those involved will surely have speculated and in some cases have known what names were hidden behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike the review of Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, dealing with the control files by the Securitate is still quite diffuse.
A systematic clarification has been boycotted and hampered in recent years.
A National Council for the Clarification of Security Files (CNSAS), corresponding to the Birthler authority, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the files since then is rather traced.
Since 2005, there has been a law regulating the administration of files.
An interview, after the awarding of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta Müller, proves that the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still quite great. In this interview a former head of the Securitate de Temesvar spoke despicably of the award.
“She has psychosis,” she was questioned only once.
The infamy of power seemed to be able to show itself without turns in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, unavoidable questions arise with the Söllner case, as so often when there are silent faults.
The calm reaction of the listeners to Söllner's confession gives hope that the continuation of this story will be governed more by the desire for knowledge and not so much by the adjudication of guilt and shame.
For the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize in literature, it is more than just a footnote.
The Champions League as a garrison to fill the stomach
When the new coach of the Stuttgart VfB football team, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from his team supplier, boarded a Mercedes C-Class taxi a quarter of an hour after midnight, it seemed that a stylishly dressed outdoor service member was leaving a very pleasant Christmas celebration, in which the sportswear manufacturer had handed out samples.
The man of baldness had hired a driver, because he still did not know the city.
Otherwise, he could also have driven the car himself: after all, there was no alcohol at stake, and neither was the 55-year-old drunk with joy.
It had been a nice evening, but tomorrow I would start work again.
Or it would start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days before: "It is true that we have reached the eighth final", namely, in the Champions League, thanks to the 3:1 win against Romania's Unirea Urziceni, "but we cannot be blinded by success: we will have to fight brutally against the descent."
The “much more important task” awaited them the following Sunday, he said.
Then, it will be necessary to repeat in Mainz the success of the "real classes" in the daily life of the league.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly evidenced again, after the quick three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Sweepstakes
The Champions League finals (one-way matches on 16/17 and 23/24 February/back games 9/10 and 16/17 March) will be raffled on 18 December in Nyon.
So the joy over Babbel’s fulminant successor’s entry remained limited.
Not only the so-called savior, who had soon inspired the bewildered profs of Stuttgart with self-confidence, willingness to surrender and a taste for the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to focus on their strengths, I urged them to be more thrown, explained the soul repairer Gross his recipe for success that sounds so simple, but that with the therapist Babbel had no effect anymore.
He displayed a certain magic, Babbel supporter Jens Lehmann accepted, "when a new impulse emerges in football, sometimes things happen that would not have been thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who after a break of several weeks due to an injury quickly advanced to become the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" perceived with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way the new boss works: "He is a man who intervenes deeply, and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation.”
And this is what was missing, obviously, when Babbel was there.
VfB Stuttgart has not passed the test yet, warns sporting director Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs, above all, constancy.
Like Gross, the players and the manager also refrained from overestimating the victory against a weakened defense due to a lack of relays and a total overrun by the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with the 0:4 had arrived the sad awakening, Khedira thought.
And manager Horst Heldt warned that while one goal of the season had been reached, the other was still far away.
We have not yet overcome the problem.
That Heldt didn’t want to celebrate his 40th birthday, even after his first home win in three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which was updated in the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, which goalkeeper Jens Lehmann had granted.
There are decisions that others make, not Jens, Heldt faced harsh criticism from Lehmann.
He had blamed weakness in the direction of the board, which had decided to change coaches due to the pressure of teenage fans.
Also that his day off after the games had been eliminated, Lehmann called it a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann’s statements were “marked by pure selfishness,” Heldt said, announcing consequences for the defendant.
They probably won't be friends forever, the two forty.
But at least they agreed with everyone else that without the previous efforts with the replaced coach team, the show of great force of play and battle would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "an important part in the success," Heldt and Lehmann said in unison; and the man of the plastic suitcase also agreed.
World Heavyweight Championship Fight
Burning Duel in Bern: Again and again challenger Kevin Johnsonn challenged world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve tough rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The judges’ trial was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains world heavyweight champion.
The 38-year-old WBC version champion beat American Kevin Johnson on Friday night in Bern by unanimous decision by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was his third successful title defense since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to perform the knockout that everyone had expected.
Klitschko extended his balance sheet to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice having to give up due to his injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept the first loss in his 24th fight.
In front of about 17,000 spectators in the Berne Arena, Klitschko, with a height of 2,02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight especially with his left hand.
But Johnson, eleven centimeters lower than before the duel had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era, was dodging the world champion’s blows again and again, so Klitschko was unable to decisively bring his dangerous right hand to his goal.
Generally speaking, Johnson’s liability did too little for a challenger, and only tried to pass the rounds.
While he was challenging Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows only rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who endured twelve full rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the challenger had already produced some scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as a “horrible zombie,” who “can’t do anything.”
While weighing, the champion was provoked on Friday to remove Johnson’s sunglasses from his nose “so he could see his eyes.”
Fourth win after Klitschko's return
Also in his fourth fight after his return on 11 October 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a break of nearly four years, he beat then Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had regained "his" WBC belt, which he had previously had to deliver without a fight.
That year he defeated Juan Carlos Gómez of Cuba and Chris Arreola of the United States in September.
In this fight I only got a hit, and I am in very good physical condition, Klitschko had explained his quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to bring together all four major titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is a world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to the British David Haye, after he dethroned 2.13-meter-tall Nikolai Valujev in November.
The previous summer, Haye had canceled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
The company that promotes it is reportedly already planning the fight against Klitschko at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the head of the Greens group, Jürgen Trittin, called the Minister of Defense, Gutenberg, a liar because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and leftists demand an explanation from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin – Following the latest revelations about the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition has reproached Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU) for knowingly deceiving.
On Saturday's "Tagesschau" news broadcast on ARD television, the head of the Greens group, Jürgen Trittin, said the minister "knowingly had not told the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, it is usually said: he told lies.
The order to kill would have been given without taking into account the rules of the International Protection Troop for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that NATO had, and that Mr. Gutenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday it was revealed that the attack was not only about destroying the kidnapped trucks, but also about intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the U.S. airstrike, requested by the German Kunduz commander, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured.
The Greens, the SPD and the left urged Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to immediately rule in the federal parliament and clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Merkel needs to clarify whether an intentional assassination strategy is part of the federal government’s Afghanistan policy, and whether the Chancellery, the military and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and his fellow Greens Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm resolutely rejected the criticism.
The foreign ministry had no influence on the German army’s concrete actions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday there were also doubts about the presentation made by the Ministry on the reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL information, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the convoys.
Officially it had been said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and had concealed sensitive details from the Minister.
However, from the environment of the two high-ranking officials it transpired that they had even reported to the Ministry of Defense the existence of several reports, including a two-page document from Colonel Klein, who was in command, and a report from a field patrol.
Meanwhile, Wichert reportedly requested in a letter to clarify the matter, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
So far he has not received a response, he said.
The ministry did not speak on Saturday regarding the accusations made against it, and said this would be clarified in the Federal Parliament’s commission of inquiry, which will be constituted next Wednesday.
Dreamy worlds
While awake, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
It is not only in the case of the mentally ill and the drug addicts that the boundaries between imagination and reality are blurred.
As long as it happens during sleep, everything is in order.
When we are lying in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can surrender unhindered to the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, anyone who experiences sleep-like states during waking, or sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, is most often considered in the modern Western world as insane or drug addict, or at least as manic.
But such images and voices do not only arise in the mentally ill or in the drugged.
Our imagination is to blame: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, sometimes cause the boundaries between sleep, madness and reality to blur.
Dream-modified states of alert consciousness can appear in the most diverse forms, at best we call them visions, and at worst, madness.
Although the triggers and effects can be distinguished, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the psychedelic experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castañeda, the states of shamanic possession, and psychoses and hallucinations can be referred to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of neuronal communication substances in the brain has been derailed – especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine – and the interaction between various parts of the brain is disrupted.
During a schizophrenic psychosis, complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts often occur.
Gravity no longer has power over it.
The relationship between madness and sleep has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived of hallucinations as a form of waking sleep, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 a "great resemblance of the state of madness to dream states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the dispositions, mad formations, and spejis".
It’s autumn 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic book figure.
His body is two-dimensional and scandalously colorful.
Gravity no longer has power over it, it is floating near the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with red jerks like blood, deformed, grinding teeth.
They are chasing him, kicking him with heavy, flaming boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pains all over his body.
Squeaky, malignant voices resonate from the walls and the radio.
He can no longer stand them, the voices that insult and offend him.
Henning T. pulls two wires from the stereo, ties them together to form a hanging knot, and fixes them on a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs into a horn and puts the knot around his neck.
Jump.
The rope is loose.
“What a lesson for you!” shout the voices in a chorus that blows his eardrums, “Go to the clinic and make them heal you!”
Now, Henning T. is 40 and has experienced six acute psychoses, the last two years ago, the first nearly 20 years ago.
The cause was the LSD.
His diagnosis is schizophrenia-affective-paranoid psychosis, he is also manic-depressive, taking drugs, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and the deepest despair, he says.
Hallucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population falls ill at least once in the life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the time those affected can no longer distinguish between the outside and the inside world, and fall into a state of over-excitement that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, relationship disorders, or persecution mania.
Especially widespread is the hearing of voices: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected person is no longer able to distinguish what is important from what is not, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like sleep, psychosis also opens the doors to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the general psychiatry clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the center of events, everything has a meaning directed at him.
At the same time he enters into a passive role, as in a dream, he feels overwhelmed by events and cannot actively organize them.
This is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, waking up, impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in a dream, says Fuchs, "the spatial and sensory structure of reality perceived in psychosis remain in principle as it is."
Paranoid thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, distancing from experience takes place in reality.
For researchers it is still unknown why our brain makes cabriolets.
According to Fuchs, states of emergency can cause anyone to lose contact with reality provisionally.
Not everyone develops a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic disposition for schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that in addition to genes there are also other determinants.
Researchers assume that those affected suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the brain’s neuronal maturity is affected at an early stage of development, such as through a mother’s viral disease during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it remains an unknown how that alteration of the neuronal system occurs, which in addition does not manifest itself at all for many years.
The influence of the environment also plays an important role – stress or a traumatic experience can be the triggers of a psychosis when a previous disposition already exists.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause a psychosis, as they interfere with the brain’s transmitting system.
When the brain is warming
The illogical thing about all this is that psychotic people suffer from their hallucinations and take very expensive drugs to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
Perceiving a hallucination as pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has been compiling reports on hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die unreale Welt in unserem Kopf, published last year.
Hallucinations are among the typical accompanying symptoms of psychosis, but also, surprisingly, of many other diseases.
Among them are, along with psychic disorders such as borderline personality disorder or depressions, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s and head-brain trauma.
Surprisingly and under certain conditions, the brains of healthy people also suffer from hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, are made up of memories that are normally found repressed.
They arise when the areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are hyperactive or poorly inhibited; when our brain gets hot, but also when stimuli are lacking.
Drugs can cause this condition in the same way as brain damage or a psychosis.
But also stimulus restriction, stress, love sickness, or other brain states of exception.
In Jüngeren Studien gab bis zu ein Drittel der Befragten, gedachtestens ein im Leben eine Halluzination erlebt zu haben.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania and attending a high school.
An ordinary girl.
If it weren't for those pictures and the voices.
Sometimes, during recess, it happens that a clumsy boy with long, dark hair speaks to her.
When she answers, the other students look at her in surprise; no one, apart from her, hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a slightly strange dreamer, but Sarah K. knows she’s not dreaming.
She's awake and sees and hears that boy, just as she sees and hears the girl sitting on the bench next door.
You can even feel their presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes the guy.
Sometimes she wonders if she's crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of the visions are not real and disappear.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
Visions are often a burden.
When he is in class he can sometimes not follow the lesson because the teacher – in his eyes and ears – is presenting a new partner, while for the rest he explains the mathematical equations in a visible and audible way.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room for sleep to arrive, which is often late and scarce, she does not know whether she is awake or dreaming, whether the images she sees, the squeaks or the girl with bleeding cuts in her arms and legs, appear in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, yelling at the figures.
Her parents and friends have told her nothing, they'd think she's crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is today20 years old.
She approved of selectivity last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago the hallucinations disappeared.
Ever since she's contacted psychologist Kasten over the Internet, she knows she's not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art out of despair.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffers from a stimulus restriction, it is very likely that after a while they will begin to have hallucinations.
I think the brain is unoccupied and is in charge of looking for entertainment.
Sarah K., the only daughter, was frightened of other children and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when, when she was 13, she learned that the man she’s called Dad since she’s used reason isn’t her biological father.
Because visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and noises, those affected like Sarah K. find it difficult to distinguish between visions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "takes place in the brain, reality projects there.
Hallucinations are just as images that the brain produces, which is why they seem so real.”
Kasten also classifies nighttime fantasies as a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of an acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, psychically healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unreal.
Kasten therefore recommends that his patients appreciate his hallucinations as a special skill.
The borderline between sleep and hallucination
In this overly conscious world, imaginary experiences are usually pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the psychiatry and psychotherapy clinic at the Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful disease but it also entails something positive and creative – madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has researched so-called oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as a dream.
Dream hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers real and that subsequently cannot differentiate from being awake.
Dream conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or disease, such as in patients with polyradiculoneuropathy, who experience motor paralysis while being fully conscious.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of himself or of the world due to a total and permanent motor disability, it replaces a very dangerous real situation with a world of its own and imaginary that is disengaged from reality.
A form of boundary situation between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, a change of world occurs, although the real situation remains present in the imagination.
An intensive way to give meaning and interpretation to an unbearable situation in itself that our own capacity for creation allows us not to sink into the nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory.
Also art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen of Zurich describes his dream experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as a soul-saving action.
He was 49 years old, when his conscience embarked on multi-day trips after heart valve surgery with heart transplant included, while his body was doomed to immobility at the intensive care station.
Claussen immersed himself in a world created by himself and visited strange places of the past: he found himself lying in bed, an elderly man aboard a sanatorium on a train, a robot watching over his health.
He was seen in the early Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorcycle kidnapped him in his home country, surfed his hospital bed in the Alps with snow firn and ran into a Korean mobster.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in memories.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, so describe your experience.
On the contrary, memories of mental journeys are, many years later, far clearer, even in irrelevant details.
Clearer and more intensive even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the horizon of the rest of our everyday experiences, adds psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneirism, psychosis, hallucinations, and drug use show how fragile the inner reproduction of outer reality is, even when we are awake.
Each modification of the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten, “can lead to a deformation of what we call reality.”
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
The snow can come
Burda
The children will take charge of the publisher at 27 years old.
The new publisher Kallen has come up with a provisional solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two sons, he told SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – Editor Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two sons become heirs at 27 and have the firm will to join the company, Burda, 69, confirmed to SPIEGEL.
The details have been arranged as a precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will actively participate in the company.
Also, if you are qualified for it.
One cannot put their children in front of 7,500 workers if they are not sufficiently trained to do so.
That would end the children and the company as well.
Burda announced Thursday that he will step down as chairman of the board of directors from January and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been named his successor.
This member of the Kallen family, 52, has been a member of Burda’s management since 1999.
At first he was responsible for the technology.
He later took charge of the treasury and with it came responsibility for the company’s assets. After the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took charge of direct marketing, abroad, printing and finance.
For the first time, no member of the family is at the top of the publishing house.
Burda’s sons are 19 and 17 years old, and his son Felix, who would now be 42, died a few years ago.
Kallen’s designation also serves to “save the differences of 10, 15 years,” according to Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Looking at the Schickendanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda said that family businesses are also not safe from decline: "This has always affected families who let themselves be infected by the hunt for capital, who have misjudged and thought they could rise as well as the biggest player.
That has never been my strategy.
I’ve never had “delusions of greatness,” says Burda.
I don’t see myself as a political tutor of this country, as Springer was, and I don’t want to play with “Time” in the world league either; those deals have become too big.
Integral beauty
Everything – in terms of beauty and well-being – you can wish for, at your fingertips.
This is what seems to have been proposed El Corte Inglés, which has just opened in the commercial center of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and mime of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious firms such as Hedonai -who takes care of laser hair removal-; Spaxion, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Tachi hairdressers; Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding section, where the teapot stands out, with more than 130 different classes of this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while contemplating the unbeatable views of the capital, or rent the relaxation area for two hours to set up your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages and a glass of champagne are some of the possibilities that Spaxion offers.
In total there are 250 m2 distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibratory platforms.
The gym also has these machines, as well as virtual 'coaches' that guide the steps of customers, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
It all starts by entering your personal key on a touch screen, located in front of the machine.
Then, several videos show us how to properly perform our exercise table.
Your manager says that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching) is enough to exercise all the muscles in your body.
And, if after exercising our body, we want to go through the hairdresser, the Luis & Tachi firm has a room where hair recovery, luminosity or nutrition rituals are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 in the morning to 22:00 at night.
Varied skirts
Christmas is approaching and it never hurts to review the looks of the stars to adapt them to our party costume.
The shape of the neckline, very important to enhance the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. It is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, with the electric car
The electric company Endesa, together with the City Council of Barcelona, have created the 'LIVE Office'.
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'LIVE Office' (Logistics for the Implantation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the road map for the implantation of the electric car in the city and will reach agreements on mobility, managing, coordinating, submitting grants, etc.
On the other hand, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
In short, it is intended to boost what will be the transport of the future.
3 'Electric cities'
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, within the MOVELE Plan, to promote the implementation of the electric vehicle.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
It aims to promote Research and Technological Development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These would include activities related to energy and in particular energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates when it comes to the promotion of electric vehicles.
The company participates in standardization groups at European level and has a number of complementary projects as active as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees a 'horizon of tranquility' for the motor sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, glimpses "a horizon of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the main export sector of the country.
In the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero reviewed the measures that the Executive has taken throughout the year to support the automotive sector.
“Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a picture of abandonment, of the closure of some of our main production plants,” he said.
“Thanks to this plan and the willingness of the brands to continue in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a horizon of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector,” he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Comprehensive Automotive Plan (PIA), allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than 3 billion euros.
The head of the Executive explained that this investment was committed both to the development of new models and to modernizing existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized government measures to support demand, in reference to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive brands.
According to the president, this plan has allowed to reduce by 6% the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market and has led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which grew "by 40 percent" in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classic Vehicle Show will be held in Madrid, a meeting space for professionals and fans of the engine mount.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Crystal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters in which there will be more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only can you find motorcycles and classic cars, but at ClassicAuto Madrid you will find items of all kinds related to the world of motoring.
Thus, among the exhibitors of the pavilion, you can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of classic motoring that will delight collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies will be, among others, Classics of Mos and Good Old Times, sale of cars; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche sale and restoration of cars; or Classics Coach, specialist Mercedes Benz.
Ability tests abroad
In addition, the commercial activity of this Salon will be completed with parallel activities: holding concentrations, sports exhibitions, skill tests, presentations and competitions.
Skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles will also be conducted on a circuit enabled outside the fairground.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sportsmanship
Mazda wants to show that sportsmanship is not at odds with respect for the environment.
For this reason, the Mazda3 has just incorporated the engine stop and start system – dubbed i-Stop – a device that at least for the moment is only available with the 2.0 gasoline engine with 150 horsepower.
This second generation of the Mazda3 stands out for the good note achieved throughout the whole.
The finishes, the finish of the vehicle, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting at the driver’s seat, we found that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and grip.
Also, the feel of the steering wheel is exquisite.
Continuing with the ensemble formed by the instrument panel and the console we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with a lot of buttons and controls and striking colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
Therefore, we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the cabin, this compact Japanese features a habitability more than enough for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
To all this is added a large trunk and with regular shapes.
The automatic engine stop and start system, at least for the time being, is only available with the two-liter 150-horsepower petrol engine and the six-speed manual gearbox.
This engine is a real delight. It stands out for its finesse, for its reduced noise, for its performance and for achieving low consumption.
Although the most demanded Mazda3 will be the diesel versions, those who do not make a high number of kilometers per year should not rule out this i-Stop with a gasoline engine, both for its high ride comfort, and for its low consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the version chosen for the test is the so-called Sportive, that is the one that incorporates a greater number of standard elements.
The standard equipment especially stands out with the Lane Change Assistant (RVM) which eliminates dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed control, photosensitive interior mirror, onboard computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioner, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy wheels.
In addition, if its equipment was too little, this version had the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: adaptive bixenon headlights and BOSE sound system with disc charger, among other elements.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts in the category.
It stands out especially for the quality of the materials used, for their behavior and for the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not make many kilometres per year will be able to opt for this i-Stop version, associated only with the 150-horsepower 2.0 gasoline engine.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between 21,770 euros of the Luxury finish and 23,270 euros of the tested version -Sportive-.
In exchange for this high figure, the Mazda3 will offer us every day large doses of satisfaction.
Luxury 'Premiere'
L. A. covers the red carpet of sensuality from the hand of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
Stars dazzled more than ever by models as elegant as ‘sexys’ at the premiere of ‘Nine’.
Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as usual, opted for a dark 'lady'.
The Promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at the mail, with no possibility of even seeing certain types of attachments or surfing the net.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is more difficult, the truth is, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what is paid, for example, for the iPhone data plan.
Given the success, the company has released two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service in exchange for paying six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It’s as limited as its American counterpart, but comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance fee, of about 12 euros per month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those traveling with a smartphone already know what it’s like to have to give up data when you cross the border or desperately look for a WiFi cafeteria (or a Fon connection) to be able to check the mail.
The idea of fixed-price roaming is incredibly appealing and it would have to be up and running for a long time.
Yes, some operators have special arrangements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a doctorate in physics to understand them and a good glasses to read the fine print.
The European Commission’s repeated pushes to achieve affordable roaming rates across Europe have barely had a discernible effect.
Outside the home country there is fear of using data, and rightly so.
That a small device like FonPeek (it is not surprising that it bears the name Fon when it lacks Wi-Fi) gets this type of rates means that operators start to think differently and study different proposals with which to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, including book download traffic and other internet queries.
No contracts and no bags.
It’s a connected device and you pay for it when you buy it, not month by month.
And that’s what I hope to see one day with FonPeek, a lifelong purchase option like Peek already has in the U.S.
Not because you're going to buy it.
I look at my mail on the phone, thank you.
I hope so because I think it’s a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's Fetish Color
Yellow is undoubtedly the preferred tone of the American first lady.
If he has already come to the inauguration of Barack Obama as President of the United States with a dress and coat of this color, he has chosen the same to accompany him in, without a doubt, the second most important moment of his life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has worn a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color -yellow green with bright reflections-, the two-time outfit consisted of three pieces - dress, jacket and coat of the same fabric - and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so, that at first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States followed in the wake of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat dressing gown.
But the fabric in which the two suits are made makes them very different.
If for the inauguration it was a fat lace, in Oslo it is a velvet with print.
The accessories have also varied: half-heeled green shoes the other time, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And equally different is the hairstyle: one picked this time, loosens the previous mane.
75% of working mothers have had work problems due to their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of the younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed in the study 'Fecundity and work path of women in Spain', prepared by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75% of working mothers have seen limited opportunities in the workplace due to motherhood.
The study indicates that there are many differences in the beginning of coexistence as a couple and the number of children, depending on whether or not they work and the type of work they do.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, work part-time, or have a non-stable job, start cohabitation as a couple, advance the first maternity, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delay coexistence and motherhood, and have fewer offspring.
"Women between 35 and 49 years old with fixed work have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after starting cohabitation, a figure that increases to 4.1 women with fixed jobs have needed more time from their life path to get them, which has led them to postpone the union and the arrival of the children.
In addition, the type of work performed exerts a lot of influence on maternity, although less on the timing of mating," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that differentiates the age of women when they get married and have the first offspring.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the higher the age at which they get married and have their first child.
The difference is also between women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49 age group, those with elementary and higher education were first-time mothers at 25.1 and 32.1 on average respectively.
"There is also a further division among women depending on their level of education.
While those who have elementary education marry and have their first child before getting a stable job, those of medium or higher levels reverse this sequence and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child.
Diane Kruger is the same.
L’Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its envied list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will become the image of different products of the brand, intonating the universal motto of 'Because I'm worth it'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, joins other famous signings of L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter such a select club were actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millionaire').
In the men’s section, the cosmetic brand also features luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (‘Grey’s Anatomy’) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline’s companion in ‘Lost’).
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Its highest representatives – yesterday’s and today’s designers and models – met at the annual awards ceremony held in London at the Royal Court os Justice.
No one was missing the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, voted Model of the Year.
The Poker of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent gives in 'Poker de aces' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty x-rays of writers who have gone through his literary life (and, in cases, also the other).
It does not do so in the predictable and fearsome genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but looking for something similar to the ignition core of the creator character.
The trip has its excitements and Vicent spares no scares or illuminations.
In addition to exquisite pleasure, the book is a moving invitation to reading and rereading.
Here are some snapshots.
Albert Camus once said, “In its pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical impulse, the same as I felt without name: pleasure against blind fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any god.”
A nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote what he had in his blood, not in his intellect, between helplessness and ignorance, with a poetic humour dazzling, meaningless, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him.
About Graham Greene: "Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching heaven through the path of perdition."
About James Joyce: "The 'Ulises' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand meter peaks of universal literature, which must be climbed along the north wall, from which the best climbers climb again and again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a weird guy.
Of himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir to a county landowner and at other times that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
Both dreams were of greatness.”
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the insane cry cast from a bridge by that Munich character to carry his echo to the bottom of the night of the twentieth century in his literary form and did so on a journey fleeing from himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to the worms."
On Dorothy Parker: “One day she got on her knees and prayed, ‘Dear God, please make me stop writing like a woman.’
On his tomb were engraved these verses of Spenser: 'The dream after the effort,/ after the storm the harbor,/ after the rest after the war,/ after life weary please death.'
About Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she also brought her depressions.
The husband would normally accept her telling him that Edward VII was spying on her among the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
Never has the case occurred of a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was ahead of his madness.
On Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try but to pass Baroja for Faulkner's guns?
What did Cela do but abdicate that man’s fame to serve as his own pedestal?”
Cowardly Aggression
Last week, my mother, about 70 years old, was walking around our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old passed by her and our dog, a mestizo breed, rescued from the kennel and with no more than six kilos of weight and, without a word, they tipped her two kicks that left the dog injured.
Our indignation is capital because we do not find fun in a free assault on a small, helpless animal, which by the way, was tied up.
To this must be added the suffocation that provoked a lady who walked quietly and who, when he cremated these individuals, came to fear for his physical integrity, since an energemen who attacks an animal, is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The event happened at five o’clock on any Tuesday afternoon for a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we put a complaint in a nearby police station that we doubted would be useful for a long time and not to generate susceptibilities, only to clarify that the murderous cowards were Spaniards.
Indignation has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand that it is happening among young people to find it fun to mistreat for free a helpless animal that gives us affection, companionship and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have been left.
Michelin and Fesvial together for wearing helmet
The Michelin tire manufacturer, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the use of the helmet, mainly among younger motorists, both entities reported today.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness about the importance of using the helmet, as it is the only element of protection capable of avoiding head injuries or even death in the event of an accident while riding a motorcycle.
Michelin said this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond designing and manufacturing safer products every day" and said it also contributes to this goal through other pedagogical and informative actions.
This new campaign to promote the use of the helmet on the motorcycle, under the motto 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum diffusion.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, since being a manufacturer of tires for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main purposes is to develop increasingly safe products.
Increase the sale of light commercials
Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to figures from the employers of the manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam.
The good data, however, should be quarantined since the reference with which the comparison is made -November 2008- was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the uptick in the last month, the registrations accumulated in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, 95,853 units have been sold together with all the vehicles that make up the tailor drawer of light commercials: derived from passenger cars, pick-up trucks, light vans and light trucks/chassis.
Also, the clouds that most affect their demand have not disappeared, because although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small and medium-sized companies, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external financing.
So, to the restrictions of the closed tap of bank credits, other factors must be added, such as the increase in unemployment levels or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
In the face of this scenario and unlike the passenger cars, the 2000E purchase aid has hardly served.
They are welcome, in addition to individuals, self-employed people and SMEs who will acquire a light commercial of up to 3.5 tons with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometer, but the number of operations has been testamentary.
Yesterday, from Ganvam they recalled the need to pay special attention by the Administration to these vehicles and also to industrialists (trucks and buses).
The sales association forecasts a 2010 similar to the year that ends, for which it calculates a fall in sales (in cars and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking assistance is now mandatory
As with anti-lock ABS brakes and ESP stability control, emergency braking assistance systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, they are already in all new passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest a period of absence is set until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians although, by its way of working, it can also help avoid many collisions by reach.
The emergency braking assistant does what it does is increase the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency, which the system detects by the stepping stone that the driver gives.
But it doesn’t always hold that pressure until the end.
According to a study by car component manufacturer Bosch, a third of the drivers involved in an accident had not stepped on the brake before the collision and half of them did not take full advantage of the force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The aid intervention, on the other hand, requires the maximum of the braking system, reducing the distance that the car takes to stop.
According to a study by the EU itself, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided per year.
The reduction will be even greater - it is estimated that one in four accidents involving damage to people would be avoided - when so-called intelligent emergency braking systems are popularized.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or a camera) detects obstacles and alerts the driver, in addition to slightly acting on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
In case it does not react, and even if the collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum effort to the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors postpones plans for Opel until January
While workers at Opel’s plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been notified by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April – probably on the 8th – as reported by Javier Ortega, the US manufacturer warns that it will need more time to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, wants is for each of the points of the plan to have been previously agreed by the affected party.
And this can cause the final document that will be submitted to the workers first and then to the governments of the countries where there are factories, to be delayed until the beginning of 2010.
Instead, GM says a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the coming days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to having contact with some potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the choice of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which is supported by the Russian group Converg, is gaining momentum.
In case there was no deal with any of them, GM could sell some of Saab’s assets to China’s Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year is up to date if it is not sold.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop their latest, expensive jewel, Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as a base and managed to lose no less than 80 kilograms, which has left the scale at just 1,275 kilograms.
This led them to do without, in the first place, the automatic roof that has been supplied by one of canvas with manual drive, thus saving 21 kilos; using aluminum doors like those of the GT3, 'fall' another 15; removing the air conditioner, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, they gained 7 kilos more; riding sports wands another 12 and with the light ones.
Finally, renouncing the CDR-30 audio system contributed another six kilograms and swapping the door handles for some fabric, the remaining kilo.
Although also offered with the dual-clutch PDK gearbox, the test was performed on a unit with the six-speed manual gearbox, mainly on California secondary roads, on mountain stretches with truly overturned paths.
His behavior can only be described as flawless.
Weight reduction does not mean that the car does not step on the asphalt with plumbing.
Rather, quite the opposite: we hadn’t tested a model so small and light that, at the same time, it conveyed so much safety in the curved passage, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles in a short gait for the necessary time, until we order him to sprint, to brake, to recover and to repress his motor...
Thanks to your address, both communicative and accurate, what we indicate with our hands at the wheel is what the car will do.
And it will do so with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is very well achieved and can be enhanced with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the roar of the engine, already released previously in the Panamera.
The ability to accelerate is brutal, either from standstill or in recoveries.
Suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we crossed with the Boxster Spyder was quite punished, but the car digested the bumps well.
The electronic aids barely acted of presence throughout the journey; and that in some of the curves we find ice at sunrise and gravel, well into the morning.
In short, an ultra-lightweight car, one of the most fun to drive on the market and that is more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010 at a price of 70,831 euros.
'Bag Girl'
Intimate Karl Lagerfeld, image of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional 'starlette' of the 'maison' parades, the singer lavished her bag face as stubbornly as her Chanel bags.
More than “Bad Girl” or “It Girl,” it’s a “Bag Girl.”
Baskonia wins a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral achieved a brilliant victory by 82-91 in their visit to the complicated court of Maccabi Electra, despite the numerous casualties that the team of Dusko Ivanovic had, and in this way is placed in the leadership of his group, after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who with eight triples scored was the best of his team (29 rating).
The Victorian team was able to replace the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work although it had to suffer until the end to take the victory.
In addition, the big hit from the perimeter, with 16 triples scored had a lot to do with the final win.
The match started face-to-face with the bluegrains, who got up from the start on the scoreboard.
That the first four baskets of the Victorians were from the perimeter already foreshadowed that they had jumped on the Israeli court with hot dolls.
English and Teletovic were the main architects of the 18-20 at the end of the first partial.
The second quarter was more of the same, but the Alava team opted for Barac's indoor play and Eliyahu's work, which was greeted with chins and applause on the return to his home, to continue expanding his advantage at rest (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although the 'minus six' rating of Splitter already foreshadowed that this was not going to be the best night of the Brazilian.
But the match, despite being on track for the rest, was not decided much less and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Victorians that on their court not anyone wins, and with 'the hand of Elijah' pressing they managed to get into the match.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the 'yellows' turning the luminous (50-49).
More inconveniences
Ivanovic’s wounded but dead a lot, they needed to spin a couple of plays with success to catch air, and in those came Mirza Teletovic’s machine gun, which with three almost consecutive triples and the help of English and Ribas returned the score to a reassuring rent (54-67), which managed to makeup the premises at the end of the third- (57).
The Alaveses left their skins in the last partial and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they would not let anyone take away what had been deserved for the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team did not resign themselves and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated by fouls, Ivanovic did not rush, they defended well, and although the Israelis approached in the final minute (80-85), the match already had ownership and the victory was escaping from Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from fighting
Unicaja lost in Greece to Olympiacos and gave them the lead of Group B of the Euroleague, in a match marked by the losses of the drawers, especially in the indoor game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the pavilion of Peace and Friendship nor by the entity of the rival, perhaps of the most powerful in Europe and on a large budget.
The game shown in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two from base Omar Cook and one from Guillem Rubio, dazzled the locals 12-18, 9 minute.
The Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the locals' arsenal in the indoor game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, flipped the scoreboard 22-20, minute 13, at which point an action, fighting conato, between the two U.S. bases Beverley and Williams, involved disqualification of both players.
The Greek ensemble began to function by showing its superiority within both zones, where the injury loss of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal fouls of Carlos Jiménez, were stressing the cajistas.
Between the indoor players and Lithuanian forward Linas Kleizas, with their triples, they increased the 44-32 lead, 19th minute.
An Impossible Rise
The third period was very offensive with Olympiacos, who despite the 19 losses, proved superior and even came to equal the difference of the match played in Malaga 66-48, minute 27, which made the leadership of the group rock.
The Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last loss of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the match.
Despite all the drawbacks the Unicaja for the direction and triples of Cook, and the contribution of Lewis, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because the Olympiacos when it pressed and given its superiority in centimeters within the area proved unstoppable.
Croatian forward Nikola Vujcic managed to pick up basketball average 81-62, minute 37, and Unicaja turned off, handing the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application of Trovit, the search engine with the highest number of classifieds of real estate, employment and engine in Spain.
The tool How much should you collect? calculates the salaries of users from the more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where they must enter their profession, years of experience, age and city where they want to work.
In the week that the application is in operation, the search engine has detected that in general the Spanish worker "feel underpaid", explained in a statement the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to the data available to Trovit from its search engines in the UK and France, Spaniards are the worst paid.
A British computer programmer charges 45,226 euros gross annually and a French one, 31,059, against the 24,000 that a Spanish one receives.
Similarly, a driver charges €34,247 net annually in England, €25,751 in France and €16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid job in Spain is that of a waiter, with 11,592 euros net annual; followed by that of a dependent, with 14,725 euros; and that of an operator, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the net in the last three months are the driver, the part-time jobs and the social worker.
Brazil sets date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian government has put an end to the stay of Manuel Zelaya in his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must leave the diplomatic legation no later than 27 January 2010, when he would officially end his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, business manager of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave before that date of the embassy, where he remains a refugee since September 21.
“He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, at the end of his term, he has to look for another destination.”
The station also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the established deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by phone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
This week, however, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was ultimately thwarted by Zelaya's rejection of the status of political asylum sought by the "de facto" government headed by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After the days of wine and roses since last spring when asset inflation has been the dominant tonic in the markets, once again uncertainty reappears in the markets, which should not be surprising since it is its natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about the future by nature uncertain.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize debt with direct asset purchases and indirectly giving liquidity-free bar at near-zero rates for financial institutions to buy assets to discount.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases are almost over and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, they are starting to throw some sand in the gears as the ECB did with its year-over-year auction next week.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the global economy to sustain economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of risk premium reduction.
Stock market volatility and corporate bond spreads have rebounded, although they remain far from the paranormal levels they reached earlier this year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt is again affected.
Once again there is a flight to quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the refuge of choice for investors, causing a widening of the differentials of the eurozone countries with respect to Germany.
Spain had hardly been affected by this episode of instability but Standard & Poor's arrived and threatened with a further downward revision of the rating of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty isn’t wrong in silencing moral risk advocates who were trying to re-emerge a conscience on those responsible for world economic policy for curbing the destructive effects of credit restriction on job destruction, when what would have to be done is to enact a new Thanksgiving.
However, what Dubai paints is a tribal struggle between the emirs to recompose power in the emirates and what Greece has seen before.
A government that hides public deficits, elections and a new government that pulls the blanket.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for ECOFIN to save Hungary from defaulting on its external payments at the beginning of the year and to allow one euro member country to default.
What makes sense is that the ECOFIN has forced the Greek government to be transparent and make its citizens accountable for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of their public finances.
If, as we expect, we are faced with an episode of normalization of transient risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, it would be within the expected range.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt spreads grow as European corporate bonds do we need not worry.
If European spreads decline and ours continue to expand, then it would be idiosyncratic Spanish risk.
When our advanced indicators are forcing most study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to revise their scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not augur much life expectancy to their warning.
Again, it has all the pint that will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although at the moment "prudence, driver friend".

Iberdrola’s president, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies in which Spain’s energy strategy is being debated these days over the next two decades.
After his speech, followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some brushstrokes of what he had proposed in the subcommittee behind closed doors.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and another 60 billion between that date and 2030, provided that the nuclear power plants are kept open today.
If not, the necessary investments will not be $60 billion, but up to $95 billion.
Of course, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade investments should not be used to increase capacity in generation, but in distribution networks and international interconnections
Starting in 2020, the issue will change and the power will have to be increased.
Its focus is on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energy.
In this case, it considers that 18,000 MW are needed, yes, with other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the Sustainable Economy Bill that the government has just approved is in line with what his company has been claiming, did not want to make blood with the royal decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts policies to fight climate change.
In his opinion, there is "a clear long-term commitment" in this regard, despite the "point-to-point" measures, as the president of Iberdrola called them.
In any case, Galán believes that investment decisions, although they are long-term, must begin to be made as they take time to mature and a stable remunerative framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus handling at 10 airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for ground-based airport services, Swissport, will play the role of preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services at ten European airports where it has a presence.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the highlights.
The agreement, which has not transcended the economic terms, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a collaboration protocol to create the Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation Center
The alliance foresees an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% corresponds to Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the center will be to investigate energy efficiency in highways and airports.
Acciona disputes its first highway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concession highway in Australia, a market in which it already works as an energy company and water manager.
The work at stake is that of a tunnel valued at 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 million euros).
The French Bouygues and the sister Hochtief are their rivals.
A 5-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the East Coast has become the closest option for Acciona to settle in the country as a builder and motorway concessionaire.
City Council wants to get it ready by the end of 2014
After opting for public-private partnership (PPP) to carry out the project, in a business plan protected by Ernst & Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to get the work and exploit the toll.
Pending their bids next May, the planned investment amounts to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.047 billion euros) and in the last phase they compete with three consortiums with a notable presence of European manufacturers.
The group named Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish group in Liza, and their teammates are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian construction companies, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
The Northern Direct consortium plays against the Acciona team, with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and final consortium that has passed the screening is the so-called LBRJV, where the capital is shared by the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which is also part of ACS), the local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the gala firm specialized in civil works Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises major works and privatizations, but brings a clear difficulty of entry if not through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy that has followed the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger, as well as Asian references, and that continues to be a pending subject for the Spanish giants of the sector.
Just ACS has achieved a position in that market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Assets of Millionaires
Acciona is committed to a geographical area of the utmost importance for the sector, in which it already has a prominent presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination business.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies in charge of raising and managing the Adelaide desalination plant, with a budget of 700 million.
His intention now is to consolidate those two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the construction and operation fields of infrastructure.
The subterranean tollway, promoted by the Brisbane City Office of Infrastructure and called Northern Link, is called to link the Toowong Western Highway with the ring road at Kelvin Grove (see map) along 5 kilometers of tunnel. This is the biggest action to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The schedule set by the Administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of works in December of next year.
Although this payment step would be opened to traffic in the last months of 2014, the work is not expected to be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two lanes per direction, electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will contribute 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to its financing.
Brisbane offers business to Hochtief
Australia continues to bear significant fruit for Hochtief, who announced yesterday the award of a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
ACS will enable, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national broadband network with fiber optic cable.
This action will offer fast internet access to 400,000 people and will give work to the German for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has transferred the construction project of the King George Tower, 27 floors, in the Australian city of Brisbane. The works were still to begin and Hochtief has closed the sale at 129 million.
Already in the UK, specifically in Manchester, he will share with Laing O’Rourke the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.
FCC awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for $64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has been awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometre long tunnel for a Slovenian motorway amounting to 64.5 million euros.
The contract comes just days after the expansion of the Bosruck tunnel in Austria was completed by 130 million euros.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its expertise in tunnel construction.
Construction is scheduled to begin in early 2010 and will run for 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore wins Renfe's publicity
Renfe has awarded advertising and marketing services over the next two years to the agency Ms. Rushmore for an amount of approximately three million euros per year, the railway operator said.
The contract includes the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Mrs. Rushmore has been chosen from among the 16 agencies that submitted to the contest convened by Renfe, of which four were finalists, among them TBWA who was responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
France Télécom fined $63 million for curbing competition
The competition regulator in France has fined France Télécom €63 million for anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean regions belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition in fixed and mobile telephony with the signing of exclusive agreements, pricing plans and loyalty programs to consumers outside the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state company accumulates more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for hindering its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday, in fact, has been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore recidivist.
Application Store
On the other hand, the French company’s mobile subsidiary has followed in the footsteps of other operators and has opened an application store on the internet, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
In principle, Orange’s app store will be active in France and the UK.
We will have to wait until 2010 for it to reach other countries, such as Spain.
Playing the Champions League has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça since its inception
The Champions League has become a source of revenue for clubs since it was born in 1992.
Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth club to earn the most money in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only provides glory, it is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
So much so, that the competition has distributed 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) that have participated in the event since the tournament was created in the 1992/93 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have done well in this game.
The white club has been the third on the continent to pocket the most money for participating, and the only one, along with AC Milan, to have won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the current champion and the last winner of the extinct European Cup in 1992, is the fifth in the standings.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that also invoiced more money for participation in the last Champions League.
And that, despite losing both in front of the barracks.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has achieved the most money through the Champions League, despite having achieved more titles than any other (five, by the four of Italy, the three of England and the two of Germany).
Distribution:
This apparent paradox is explained by UEFA’s complicated money-sharing procedure.
For this year, the body that chairs Michel Platini expects to earn $1.09 billion from the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA will dedicate 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the previous qualifying round (including Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just to be there, in addition to another 550,000 euros for each game they compete in.
There are also bonuses for winning (800,000 euros) and for tying (400,000 for each team). The eight-finalists will receive three million each; the eight-quarter-finalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will pocket 4 million each.
The champion will win 9 million, compared to the finalist’s 5.2 million.
Thus, in terms of fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
Barca, on the other hand, pocketed 2.5 million to win the European Super Cup in August.
But there are also variable payments, for which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main languages, and has four assigned places.
The previous year’s champion gets 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of matches played in this year’s edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group yesterday unraveled the details of the share purchase offer with which it aims to acquire a cap of between 25% and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not require you to launch a public takeover offer (opa) for all securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers 1.5025 euros per share that would be disbursed in 10 years and that would be repaid with an interest for such a postponement of 1% annually.
Yesterday the shares of Sos closed at 1.85 euros; therefore, the offer of Nueva Rumasa values the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerez group gives shareholders a 15-day period to communicate their interest in selling securities.
The CNMV said it had not been informed of the offer, even though the Ruiz Mateos company said it had contacted the regulator.
If done, the disbursement would reach 611.7 million when the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure his management.
In an attempt to stay away from possible purchase offers and the judicial changes of their former managers, the Jesús brothers and Jaime Salazar, announced the election of Maria Luisa Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a senior position in the food company.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the group president.
And it is not without controversy, as the company remains immersed in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million from Sos to Salazar societies.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that over the next few months Sos will reveal new diversions of funds.
Regarding the credit to the Salazars, yesterday they declared in the National Audience the former councilors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) and affirmed that they approved the diversion of 212 million without knowing their fate.
The CNMV authorizes the opa of exclusion of Paternina presented by Inversa Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the opa of exclusion presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on October 9.
The supervisory body has explained that it authorizes this operation because it understands that its terms comply with current rules and considers "sufficient" the content of the explanatory leaflet presented after the amendments introduced on December 2.
The CNMV has specified that the offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which represents 8.95% of its share capital, which is composed of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao Stock Exchanges.
He also explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been immobilized, which will not be transmitted in any way until the end of the offer, of which he has specified that the price has been fixed by Federico Paterina, in accordance with the provisions of current regulations.
New tools for periting cars
In these days of storms and accidents, not only car workshops win.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered a disaster are towed to a workshop, where an expert must evaluate the damage suffered and what the cost of repair will be.
No accident is the same, and calculating parts costs and labor time can be a lengthy and complicated task.
Manually calculate the cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and labor, can take two or three hours.
Instead, with the support of the latest computer tools it would be a matter of minutes.
That’s why almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Service providers and solutions for claims valuation and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information supplied by manufacturers, then processing it and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the American group Solera, is the leading firm; 80% of the valuations are made with its products.
The other firms competing in the field of appraisal tools and information processing on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data that manufacturers provide is far from straightforward.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, in Spain they work with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with the information in different formats.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, to the point that in the last five years more versions, variants and engines have been released than in the previous fifteen.
As soon as a new car comes out, these companies get to work.
It is a very difficult task, because you have to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and enter its price.
In addition, each model is made a "smart" graphic image where you can "pin" different parts of tourism.
If it’s a windy model, the job can be ready in a week if the process goes very fast.
If it is a minority car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of the cars marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models are information about Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the mobile park that circulates, they exceed 99%.
To carry out the documentation work and the elaboration of the databases, Audatex has eight centers spread around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in developing these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million pieces of data are included, and customers receive updates every other day.
The elaboration of that huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer various products.
The most frequent use focuses on repair and maintenance, but in which countries there are also tools for managing scrap parts or for calculating the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that reports on the value of used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support they can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard solution for the assessment of claims, aimed at experts.
Includes cars, motorcycles and light or heavy commercial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint bars.
This tool is paid according to use, for each valuation.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which performs thousands of expert reviews, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow full identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it left the assembly line only with its frame number.
AudaGlass focuses on the moons of vehicles, and AudaSubastas is a service open to the professional sector on the internet that allows bidding for vehicles declared total sinister.
Its statistics service is very useful to identify trends, perform geodemographic analysis or know deviations by model brands.
You can study, for example, how many models of a certain brand have passed through the workshop due to breakdowns or how many have suffered serious accidents in a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It markets, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also aimed at experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or official prices and times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damages, breakdowns or maintenance of the automobile.
The Gt Rating Guide is your historical benchmark product in the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has grown at a rate of 20% per year in the last three years, and in 2008 it invoiced 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year they began their process of internationalization, with the installation of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and was established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company’s sources, 62% of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
Solera’s global turnover (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, up 3.3% from 2008.
In our country the company will enter 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera group was worth $1 billion, and now its shares are trading at a total value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007 it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Internet auction of accidental cars
Last October, the Solera group bought Autoonline, an online platform for the sale of cars such as motorcycles or special vehicles.
The transaction involved a disbursement of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company’s capital, which could be extended next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing an immense international market.
This valuation and sales service is exclusively aimed at professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, workshops, scrap shops and professional sellers who must register before starting operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Its main markets include Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
3,000 ads are managed daily and about 100 new ads are included in the Spanish market every day.
Under Spanish law, a car whose frame number has been dropped cannot be recirculated, but certain parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Cars with historical value can be discharged even if they have been discharged after some mischievous efforts.
Workshop budget in four steps
With the Auda-Workshop tool, the Audatex company ensures that the user gets a budget in just four steps: identify the vehicle, find the replacement, create a budget and generate a budget.
Ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, who to a greater or lesser extent are usually more reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 cars, 109 off-roaders, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, to use it requires a computer with internet connection.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its frame number, a real graphical image of the model in question appears and then the necessary replacement is selected.
The user can include variables such as labor price, surcharges or discounts, and then can print the budget to deliver to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an appraisal tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented system does not include estimated manpower times.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the client can finance.
Currently the company Audatex is working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with very good eyes, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it around to see the inner face.
