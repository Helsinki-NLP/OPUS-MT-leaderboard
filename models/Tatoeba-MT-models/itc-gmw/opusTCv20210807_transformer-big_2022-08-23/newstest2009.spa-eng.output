The Prague Stock Exchange finished with fewer points at the end of the day.
After the rapid fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
Transactions of the shares reached about half the value they have on a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, at the beginning of Tuesday trade, reacted immediately to Monday's fall when it fell to about 6%.
The drop this time is due to the fall in stocks on Wall Street.
Here too, the reaction of the market to the outcome of the vote of the American Assembly of Representatives that refused to support the stabilization plan of the secretary of the financial sector is expressed.
Decline in stocks in Asia
Stocks on the Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic drop on Tuesday, though the index eventually softened some of the losses over the course of the day.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng stock market index over its financial day was nearly four percent, although it later softened its losses by reducing the decline by nearly 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index that tracks Chinese stock movements on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange fell 3.8 percent, in Shanghai markets were closed.
Shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent but, in the end, losses dropped to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange, according to the Index secretary, fell to 3.6 percent.
“The rescue actions scheduled in the U.S. are insecure and this influences the financial market around the world,” said Hong Kong’s Chief Currency Officer Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it only determines its monetary policy, that is, without dependence on the Central Bank of China.
Hong Kong’s interest rates are at the same level as those of the United States.
U.S. lawmakers should meet again as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens that the falls will be felt in other countries.
Bloody Bathing of American Stocks
On Monday, the American Assembly of Representatives rejected the plan to help the financial system to which it should devote $700 billion (almost 12 trillion kronor).
Lawmakers, in that way, ignored President George Bush’s invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would solve the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. stocks experienced a bloody bath and mainly the stock index picked up the biggest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index dropped to nearly seven percent, with a similar volume drop last recorded in 1987.
The index went down before it was announced but as soon as it was shown that the proposal of the assembly did not go forward, the index began to fall freely.
Congress Withdraws: U.S. Government May Inject $700 Billion into Banking
The highest representatives of Congress and the government, President George W. Bush, agreed on a broad-based pact of financial aid to the American financial system.
The vote will take place early next week.
U.S. lawmakers have caused a gap in talks about approving the bailout plan in its form of aid to the U.S. financial system with the amount of $700 billion (approximately 12 trillion kronor).
However, it is not yet won.
Congress must fine-tune some details of the contract before they can make the final form of the law public and get it voted on.
The plan to help the financial system will be discussed Monday in the Assembly of Representatives.
He told Reuters on Sunday, Barney Frank, chairman of the Assembly’s Committee on Financial Services and Banking.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be held in the Senate no earlier than Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of the rescue plan ratification should represent the announcement of a psychologically significant first factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
Then, however, “disenchantment” will be achieved thanks to the complex mechanisms whose aid to the market will also reach in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made a great breakthrough.
We have resolved our disagreeing views on how the package of measures for stabilizing the market should be done,” Democrat Nancy Pelosiá told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still be held on Sunday.
Representatives of lawmakers met Sunday night with Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give a definitive shape to the government fund.
It should buy from financial corporations the unsold mortgage assets that take financial firms to hard losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
“We are about to close the agreement on the plan, which will work and should also be effective in the market.
We still need to continue with the sanitation plan, but I think we’re already in it,” Paulson said.
A Sign for Asian Business
The global financial crisis has an explicit impact on the rapidly falling stock market.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are doing everything they can to get Congress to definitively pass a deal this Sunday.
They want to reassure investors of the Asian financial market as these are the ones in the first time zone and where Congress could influence Monday’s trade.
However, for now there is nothing clear about when the two chambers of Congress will vote and, not even, if they will not stall at the last moment with some problem.
Lawmakers expect it to be passed in the coming days.
The law, however, will undergo a number of changes.
The total amount intended to help the system must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion needs to be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush has requested.
However, Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it has the impression that the program does not fulfill its function, which would be another $100 billion and, later, the last $350 billion.
Bush praised the progress of the meetings.
On the other hand, the president can veto this decision but Congress can overcome his veto by a majority of votes.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program of earning financial resources for the repurchase of bad mortgage bonds was preserved, the value of which fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to finish paying off their mortgages.
“We have worked everything.
The Assembly of Representatives would have to be prepared to vote on the bill on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday,” said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
U.S. President Bush is also pleased with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is pleased with Saturday’s move and that he values “the commitment of both sides to stabilizing our financial market and protecting our economy.”
Limitation of the armored contract
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, said lawmakers decided on the responsibility of program money for protecting taxpayers’ taxes from their losses, a soothing closure of the planned finance plan.
The new law should also limit so-called armoured contracts for directors of participating companies, and create a committee that will have control of the Fund.
This would have to be directed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We’ve worked very hard on it, and we’ve made a major breakthrough toward the agreement that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also includes helping homeowners who have problems with their payments.
The government would have to agree to the new mortgage payments it buys in order to lower the monthly charges on debtors’ installments and enable them to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological help
The proposed plan is, according to Patria Finance chief economist David Marek, a good idea that will be realized but quite difficult.
“And that’s why it’s not known by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be bought.
This will be decisive for the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government,” Marek said this week, for the iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week is not, according to Marek, as relevant.
“Much more important is that already this week the congressmen agree on their support and give them their approval as soon as possible.
This important and psychological agreement that this approval is reached is, at the moment, the most important thing,” Marek insisted.
Armed hand fight: the MP3 player against the mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost every mobile phone plays MP3 files, no MP3 player gets to make calls.
It seems clear that it is better to buy only the phone.
There are still enough reasons for man to acquire only the breeder.
The choice depends practically on the manner of its use and the requirement of the future owner.
It will probably be difficult for him to acquire the most modern record player to listen to Maxim Turbulenc’s latest album on it.
On the other hand, this type of musical products such as LP records no longer come out, and as far as their quality is concerned, there is not a single objective reason to continue buying them.
If vinyl records with art rock, jazz or blues music are cluttered on their shelves, you’re probably dreaming, at least, of this type of record player.
This is the same with music that is on the way, that is, compressed, simplified music - music in MP3.
And here there are price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, the same as for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly taste the market helmets of twenty crowns.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for each.
The choice is wide.
It also determines the battery life.
Some of the best players get much more than just playing music and even that than even most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
Faced with the most basic functions such as calling, sending messages, you can play music and video, record both, you have a better or worse camera and you can even get to browse.
And when we take into account the Smartphone and the PDAs will also have in your pocket a small computer.
This is a small miracle as no refrigerator knows how to grill and no television can photograph.
The universality of mobile also brings us disadvantages.
The more functions you use on the mobile before the display indicator will light up asking to be recharged.
And music playback is one of the biggest energy drags.
Few mobile phones can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, most of them much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest ones) clearly perform better.
So keep in mind that cheap mobile phones won’t play for more than two hours.
If, on top of this, they constantly call themselves still, for more safety, a charger for the job - this applies also for the most expensive devices.
With the MP3 player this problem is not going to have it, because even the worst ones endure at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a charge.
Another problem occurs when recording music on mobile.
Unfortunately only a part of the devices has the universal USB connector and, moreover, not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course it is possible to record music directly on the memory card but only on some unreduced drives can connect the small memory cards that are used on mobiles.
On players, with some exception (iPod), no special software is needed.
Just fill the device with music through the USB of the computer.
Most mobiles and players create their own order in the music library according to the performer's name, album title, genre or also according to user rating.
Some devices only show a directory with a tree structure similar to a Windows Finder and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
The player tries to serve, the mobile knows more
For the choice of a specific equipment you are interested in the resistance of the accumulator, the capacity of the memory, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of its handling.
If you listen, above all, to the music as background and you will listen to it every day only for a while, as in the tram, then enough with any mobile you play.
What practically gets any mobile.
You should not even be interested in the format in which the mobile or player plays the music.
The MP3 will be played by everyone and almost all the music that comes to it will be in this format.
It is among the most widespread and with the exception of it the absolute majority of devices play music in WMA format.
The least includes the AAC format (format used by the Apple company and its iPod).
The best mobile phones also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
It is enough through the mobile internet to visit the competent pages of the operator (or any other service provider) and buy a song or an album.
This service could by itself be a weighty argument for acquiring a mobile for music.
Unfortunately the offer of the operators is miserable and most is limited only to the topics of fleeting success of the radios.
Prices are not the lowest either.
However, in general, it is assumed that precisely this way of selling music (whether by GSM, internet or wireless internet) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people always carry a mobile phone.
Whenever you feel like hearing something, you will find the phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry headphones or, at least, handsfree.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has virtually every mobile even at least one MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage for many mobiles with music will be its price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than 3,000.
Between three and four thousand crowns you can already buy a good walkman.
Most of you will limit the absence of an input for classic headphones.
The best, even when it comes to the technical part, such as phones equipped with a 3.5 mm input for a classic headset, cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of the players is nothing more than their easy service.
The simplest players - by no means necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - are actually handled by anyone.
The minimal functions, their handling similar to the previous ordinary cassettes or also the record players is evident.
It does not pose a threat in the sense that we mistakenly connect to the internet with the mobile and, consequently, gigantic account for data downloads.
by which device to decide
Even the cheapest phones (e.g., the Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for changing the memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a suitable card you will reach the two thousand crowns.
However, be careful.
Basic models are usually only equipped with a 2 GB maximum capacity card.
Only the most expensive ones have a memory of 8 GB.
If you already have a mobile and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, have a look at Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (maximum 2 GB) no more than 1,100 crowns need be spent.
If you consider yourself among the most demanding lovers of music, take the hand of the most specialized mobile-walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for the MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as that of the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose walkman line phones have almost identical use as that of a standalone MP3 player.
The same service and the same category in terms of price, over the four thousand crowns, but with a greater capacity of memory (up to 16 GB) and accumulator (usually 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the brand cited more aria brings them MP3 players.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Probably
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
However, here we still lack something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
It probably won't be long before he arrives.
That Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe, we have already written it on mobile.cz.
The rest was also confirmed by the Czech Telecommunication Office (TB), which warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is among the most expensive in the whole Union.
After the latest steps by the European Commission in the field of roaming fee regulation, a paradoxical situation is likely to arise - for some customers of Czech mobile operators the SMS they send from abroad will be cheaper than if they send it from home.
How is it possible for prices in the Czech Republic to remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, lacking competition that really wants to fight.
This probably seems paradoxical, as we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that there is extreme competition in the Czech market.
The Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunication Bureau (TBT), Pavel Dvosak, has already said that there is no place in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It is perhaps true that for a classic operator with his own network he no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be very difficult to find some frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
Precisely the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market brought a marked decline in prices to which the classic operators must have reacted as well.
At the same time, even before the entry of sharks such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile into the UK market, similar voices were heard both here and there.
It has been shown that there is room for such operators and that they can succeed.
There is no need to look for examples too far.
In February of this year we informed you about the premiere of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
After only half a year, this operator managed to obtain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighboring country.
On the other hand, behind Mobilking is the Penta group which, apart from that, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators lies in the possibility of concentrating on many more specific target groups.
In addition, for them to function effectively, they have far fewer customers than a classic operator.
They do not carry relatively large expenses in the construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world, these types of virtual operators are usually low-cost - they offer cheap calls and SMS messages which, however, is often countered by the offer of tighter services.
For example, Tesco mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than the competition.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a good blow to bet on a trivial goal group.
This operator specifically targets man.
“The right man chooses Mobilking – he’s the operator he likes and can be trusted,” says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which works with this virtual operator.
It’s hard to say if such a concept as that of Poland could hook on our country.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav ?epick? said: "The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, from the point of view of the offer of services it is relatively saturated"
In the Czech Republic there are no possibilities, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if in the Czech Republic there will be some virtual operator that will not be Mobilking.
“We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech Republic it does not seem too hopeful.
Rather, it’s about launching Mobilking in other countries in our region,” Jana Studniková, a spokesman for the financial group Penta, said in a telephone conversation on mobile.cz.
He indirectly assured that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic definitely do not bow to this idea.
Rather, they try to do everything possible so that no potential competition arises.
Interest in the launch of a virtual mobile operator is already shown by the GTS Novera group that would like to take a step further to become a real Telefónica O2 competition in the field of corporate customers.
“We have a great interest in this, to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telephony services but also mobile telephony services.
And the sooner, the better.
With this possibility we have met repeatedly with all the Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we have made progress in the meetings,” said the group’s spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
Then maybe they sparkle better times.
It seems that, due to unofficial information, the first official operator would have to arrive possibly by the end of the year.
But for now his appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
“At the moment we believe that the situation is ideal for the emergence of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market.
So far no one has addressed us with any complex and serious project in this field," said Vlastimil Sr?e?, spokesman for Telefonica O2.
The specificity of the Czech market is referred to by other operators.
T-mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová, in exceptional accordance with O2’s opinion, adds: “Until today we have not registered any viable commercial project that, bilaterally profitable, can continue to develop.”
“On the T-Mobile network it will be difficult to find a virtual operator until the end of the year.
At this moment we should already have on the table some concrete contract that it was possible to study in such a short horizon.
Vodafone is focusing on meeting the requirements of a 3G license.
Miroslav Sepick adds: “We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this is when it comes to spending and infrastructure sharing.
We see it as the biggest contribution from the point of view of customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this field is to partner with a partner to establish a shared network for fast internet on mobile.”
Responsible offices - with nail and meat operators
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increasing competition which would lead to a fall in prices and thus to a decrease in profits.
So why make it easier to enter the competition?
When operators want to achieve something, they are able to pull from the same rope, proof of this is the grip when U:fon emerged.
Perhaps the biggest pressure on the T was at the time of U:fon’s entry by the T-Mobile company.
This is attested by the public information accessible on the T’s web pages.
But precisely now U:fon serves as an argument for why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds to this: “Furthermore, not long ago the competitive environment in the mobile phone market was opened to a fourth operator.
As far as the character of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is concerned, it is natural that another player’s entry into the market would mean great requirements for him and, above all, for his services.”
That is why this access to mobile operators is tremendously discouraging due to the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
It is not just about the position of the TU, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in commercial tenders, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Bidding (OHS).
However, she expressed her typical stance on this issue.
“The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile phone market would be possible after an agreement on renting the necessary infrastructure between a mobile operator and a virtual operator was closed.
To date, no agreement has been concluded as the offer of potential stakeholders was not interesting enough for the classic operators," Kristián Chalupa, from the foreign affairs department of the OHS, added to our question.
These statements do not surprise the representatives of the operators.
For offices that must represent the interests of consumers it is more than a consideration, apart from that they must note that no one takes advantage of their position in the market.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Overseas where virtual operators operate normally we can see that their entry into the market contributed to the drop in prices of mobile phone services"
Of course, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and the fall in prices are not in the interest of OHS.
What is truly shocking about all of this is the dissonant reactions that result from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it is really a coincidence, is offered on its own.
It is the same as with the price of gasoline at the gas stations because it is clear that it is the work of chance and a hard fight for competition.
“The Office has found no signs of unfair competition in this regard and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position therefore do not have a corresponding rise in responsibility in their market actions.
The tools needed to open the mobile phone market to virtual operators, rather, are lacking, as well as telecom regulators,” Chalupa added.
Interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many points of conflict.
There is, of course, a relevant market analysis prepared by the IOT according to which telecommunications are from the point of view of commercial tendering a single market.
In this type of market, of course, none of the Czech traders has a dominant position.
However some of the legal experts offer another vision - for a virtual operator to emerge it is always necessary to agree with the network administrator.
And the mobile operator – with all its logic – has a monopoly on its network.
Therefore, in a particular segment it must necessarily be dominant.
And if this argument were not accepted, at least for OHS it should be a warning that three mobile operators rise strikingly alike.
The current complaints from interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that in all negotiations with the operators they face many similar impediments.
Carrying the responsibility in the IT is a fairly common trick in the field of telecommunications from which the OHS washes its hands in all this matter.
We have met him already in some similar cases.
Unfortunately recently a new amendment was introduced to the telecommunications law for the expansion of the competition of the TB in the field of commercial tenders that was not carried out, even though a number of specialists promised that the situation would improve.
The representatives of OHS must know this well, but it is clear that their interests lie elsewhere.
Everything is fine when no one is watching
At the same time, something like a pseudo-virtual operator that already exists in Czech mobile phone networks remains unnoticed.
They are companies that put their own prices to mobile phone services that, however, only a part are public.
Usually these are companies that are engaged in multilevel marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Usually only a select few get the price list of these companies.
The magic is that the company, with respect to the carrier, acts as a classic business customer of the same ordering a large number of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will then receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that the trade conditions in all Czech mobile operators prohibit this type of resale.
"If cases such as those cited were discovered, we could talk about breaches of contract conditions that could result in the end of the collaboration with the given society," Martina Kemrová replied to the question about this problem.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity carried out by mobile operators would reach responsible people.
It is precisely in the case of the three companies mentioned that it can be thousands of customers.
None of the operators are against this procedure.
With the activities of these companies they make not negligible profits and, at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav ?epick? warns us of the possible problems: "the law allows such speculation, however, the services of this company are used only by a negligible both percent of customers.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card of their phone is not in their name so they cannot absolutely dispose of it as a normal customer of the carriers.
This is exactly what should seem to you minimally strange.
There is also a new question for OHS.
If mobile carriers turn their eyes on this type of procedure, why do they block the virtual carrier’s entry?
It is necessary to add that the OHS has sufficient competence to discover this type of activities and if you do not want to, you should not be satisfied with the explanations of the operators that they have no idea of this story and that their commercial conditions do not allow it.
When will we stop being the most expensive?
As already made clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market brought a significant decrease in the prices of services.
At the same time, in virtually every country where the virtual operator emerged, classical operators tried more or less to protect themselves from this outbreak.
The arguments used by these were virtually all identical - too small, a market eventually too saturated, problems with the quality of service, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, regulatory bodies have now intervened and in none of the cases did they defend the operators but their customers.
Whether it was through formal measures or informal pressure, the first virtual operator emerged and more began to emerge.
Unfortunately, the Czech Regulatory Body all this case goes through as if it were a burning nail.
From our experience we cannot help but be impressed that the confusion of the attributions in these cases suits them.
But let us not despair.
If this behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator actually reaches these lands, then the Czech mobile phone market is likely to start moving again.
If one of the carriers lets in a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult for the OHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And perhaps we will stop calling it more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the Czech official anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of Czech official celebrations presented the new official recording of the hymn Where, My Home.
The new anthem was recorded by the National Theatre orchestra under the direction of Ji? B?lohlávek.
There are four versions available - two versions that are Solos, one to male voice and one to female voice, one with Chorus and another instrumental.
The singing is handled by Katerina Kninková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the anthem arrangements are Otakar Jeremia and Jaroslav Krcek.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
Belohlávek considers this national Czech chant as one of the most beautiful hymns.
Czech Radio said earlier that it intentionally chose for the Solos singers with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
“From the beginning I have tried with the two and then, too, with the Choir to look at the diction so that the text is well understood, so that it has consonance,” he said.
The Czech official anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where, My Home first played in 1834 on the tables of the State Theatre in Josef Kajetán Tyl's original Czech play Fidlova?ka and arranged with Franti?ek ?kroup's music.
It gained popularity and people made it their own.
The first stanza of the song after the rise of Czechoslovakia in 1918 became, naturally, a part of the official anthem.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" anthem sound?
The MHD of Prague takes us Wednesday for the first time with the chip
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, the history of the Prague Transport Company records the date on which the first passengers enter the metro, tram and bus with an electronic voucher in their pockets instead of a paper ticket.
This can be purchased right now by almost 100,000 people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase the 30-day, 90-day and annual voucher (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously charge it on their chip card at the transport company's infocenters and stations at the Metro, Muzeum, M?stek, Nádra? Hole?ovice, And?l, Rozty?l, Let?k?a??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
The vouchers can be purchased online today at the transport company’s website, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until the afternoon, was used by more than 400 people.
Those who start using the internet as a form of commerce can definitely start to forget about ticket sales stalls at metro stations, where until now they had to regularly queue up to get a normal ticket.
The voucher is purchased online, and the Opencard is recharged at one of the thirteen branches of the Municipal Library.
“In these places there is a ready-made staff window that helps those interested with online purchases and also with the reloading of the voucher purchased on their card,” said project spokesman Martin Opatrn.
In addition to the library, it will also be possible to recharge the electronic voucher on the Opencard at the vending machines found in some subway halls.
What are these vending machines like?
They are red, they remind us of a banknote chopping machine and travelers will probably have already noticed them at the metro stations of Roztyly, Budzjovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavska.
“There are now five in the city but by the end of the year there would have to be eighty,” Opartrno said.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Simply enter the Opencard chip card and the previously paid bonus will be charged only on it.
Electronic bonds from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, on ring-road trains and bus lines from numbers 300 to 499 that mainly use the inhabitants of the towns of central Bohemia.
“On trains attached to Prague’s integrated transport there are reviewers equipped with a reading card that will help confirm the validity of the time and the bonus zone,” explained Filip Drapal of the organization Ropid, which sets the schedules of public transport in Prague.
Bypass buses have their reading cards mounted at the driver’s locker.
Upon entering it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also it is necessary to accompany him with the Opencard in the place intended for it on the side of the Box.
With this, the driver controls the validity of the bonus.
“If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the vouchers, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information,” Drapal added.
Passengers who do not travel on ring buses and do not remember when the voucher is expired can go to the vending machines where the cards are recharged.
Here, on the machine screen, you will be shown information about the validity of your document.
The South East wanted to be part of the U.S. in a referendum.
The German Sudetenland asked in 1945 that Smoke be part of the United States.
This is what is extracted from the letter that is stored in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to at least live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With this desire, some groups of Sudeten Germans were presumably addressed to the President of the United States in 1945.
It results from the letters that are kept in a particular archive and that today are kept in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
In a letter to the U.S. president, the Germans asked that he not allow the return of the "Umava Land" - occupied by Hitler under the Munich Pact - back to Czechoslovakia.
“We have correctly understood the situation and we really want your word that American units are coming to German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators,” the letter reads, signed with a “people who carry the fate of Umava in their hearts.”
In view of the fact that the union of Czechoslovakia with the southeastern Germans presumably represents - according to their Czech national character - a hope only in brutality, disregard, incomprehension, pressure and slavery, the authors plead in the letter to the American president that he should assume, for today and forever, the Umava under a protectorate.
“We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of four million people, we surrender ourselves to a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that in no way contributes to the victory of the Allies,” the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is presumably the fear of retaliation from the “Czech oppressors.”
If the president of the United States presumably doubted this idea of the Germans, it would suffice to organize a referendum on the lands of the United States on whether its inhabitants want to be part of the United States or live under its patronage.
Although the text of the letter, with the current knowledge of post-war history, may sound a little childish, according to some specialists paints closely the expectations of the Germans of the southeast at the time.
Although the Czech Germans must have intuited minimally that it was going to be about their expulsion from the republic, only a few admitted this possibility.
Some hoped that the United States and Britain would negotiate for the Sudetenland some clear form of autonomy.
Others thought they would stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed even by Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who was born in Cheské Budajovice.
He was in the war, as a German from Budajovice, enlisted in the Baltic navy.
When at the end of the war the British seized him and placed him in the prison camp of Holstein dozens of Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
“They thought that when they came home, the Czech would be good for them,” Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, expected that on the basis of Bene's decrees they would be removed from the Republic.
Don't think - you pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
In this way one could characterize the emotional campaign that the Ministry of Transport decided to launch on Wednesday in the media.
The minister’s office, Alești Ebișek, promises to deter drivers from dangerous driving behavior.
The 150-million-dollar campaign will be heard on television, radio, film, the internet and in pamphlets.
It would have to deter the driver from high speed and alcohol driving.
And also to remind them that before starting to go, the belts are tied.
It wants to raise the awareness of young drivers, motorists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what can we see in the ads?
Basically human stories that ramble to emotions.
And this is witnessed by the "blood" ads throughout the campaign:
Don't think - you pay!
The word "Don't think" is written with large letters on the license plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word "payas."
This should symbolize that the man in a moment of desperation can come to pay with his own life.
Advertisements will "brighten" viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign carried out in Anglo-Saxon lands where strong images of accident victims can be seen.
It promises that that way it will reduce accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The announcements were made by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and Whip for Drivers
“For drivers, the sugar and whip system is worth it.
Sugar is for him when, for example, he passes a red light and thus saves time.
The whip is a threat of fine or accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risks,” says Na Homolce hospital transport psychologist Martin Ko?n.
And that is why an information campaign is needed in the press and mainly negative advertising, the psychologist specifies.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of the dangers.
"If there is any panel installed warning of any danger it will likely soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay any more attention to it," he said.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The president of Israel’s provisional government, Ehud Olmert, ruled on the restitution of virtually all the lands occupied in 1967, namely the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He proposed in the interview that on Monday he appeared in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
“We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians which means we will necessarily have to return almost all (occupied) lands if not all,” Olmert told the newspaper.
"I'm sure we'll keep a little bit of this land, but we'll have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of Israel's land) because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that in case of restitution East Jerusalem would also be included.
"He who wants safety in Jerusalem and therefore does not want the tractors or excavators to pass over his legs as happened to one of my best friends, then he will have to deliver a part of Jerusalem," Olmert said in reference to the two July attacks in the city in which several people were killed and dozens were injured.
According to the president, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Hill, a sacred and historical place" that is located inside the ancient city.
“He who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won’t work,” he insisted later.
Retreat from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke out for Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which in his view is an inherent condition for concluding a peace deal with Syria.
But this would also involve concrete efforts on the part of Damascus.
“I do not propose to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal of the Golan,” he said.
“The Syrians know well what they will have to detach to win the Golan.
They will have to abandon their current relations with Iran, they will have to abandon their relations with Hezbollah (the cheetah movement), they will have to detach themselves from the permanent support provoked by the terrorism of Hamas (the cheetah movement), Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq.
Questions After the Accident: Are Hostesses Illegal on Buses?
The law is unknown, you can't walk on a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency company near the Italian city of Padua, we are asked if the flight attendants and passengers can move around the bus during the trip.
“If we wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the stewardess is opposed to road traffic law,” said Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which the 22-year-old hostess died last week was evidently caused by the driver of the truck only the bus crossed the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the less safe place of the vehicle despite having reserved two other places.
However, the bus may have an accident or suddenly brake, and at the exact moment the steward delivers the coffee or newspapers.
Here what plays the role is whether the bus is equipped, according to the technical permission, with walking places.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must be seated.
The long-distance buses of the Student Agency have no places to stand, which was confirmed by the director of the company, Radim Jancura, to Aktuáln.cz.
“We have solved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally this was removed and we reached the agreement that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus is running if they have a seat,” he said.
The hostess does not know the law.
“There is no obvious legal interpretation of the hostess’ role – no legal provision clarifies this function.
Not even any legal provision prohibits transport agents from performing any service.
The road transport law only knows the term Vehicle Reviewer, whose rights and obligations are not defined," Hanzelka said.
The director of the Department of Road Vehicle Traffic of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorn, believes, on the contrary, that the law sufficiently addresses this problem.
"It depends on whether the bus has the approval allowed to have walking places.
That's all," he says.
Buses are divided between urban, where there are places to stand and of limited maximum speed, interurban with places to stand with a greater permit of speed and those of long distances without places to stand, with the greater permit of speed and with seats equipped with seat belts.
Just like on the plane, says the expert.
BESIP’s expert on Transport Safety, Jaroslav Hocín, sees no major problems regarding the movement of the steward on the bus.
"During the development of the trip there is not much danger, the situation can be compared to the service in the planes.
Even here you are not sure that the turbulence is coming and that the hostess can be hit on the head.”
“However, if the bus suddenly brakes, obviously the physical laws are valid.
Same as on a city bus or on the tram.
The safety of the hostess must be solved by the internal regulations of the carrier," he says and also thinks that from the point of view of law this problem is unresolved.
Jancura is prepared to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only carrier offering the flight attendant service.
He employs two hundred.
The director, not even after the accident, considers that work risky.
“However, the moment I get the impression that the hostess job is risky, then I will suppress it.
Coffee and newspapers can receive it, passengers, upon entering.
It would even save expenses,” he says.
In the interest of safety is why Asiana lacks stewardesses in her vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, who runs a small line compared to SA.
“We don’t have hostesses, we’re against them from the beginning.
Sooner or later this will end in a deadly accident," he told T?den.cz less than a year ago.
There was a huge tragedy
In the accident of the line that connects Naples died a young stewardess of Pilsen who had worked for the company two years.
A Slovenian truck that probably turned from the parking lane blocking the passage to the bus.
His driver tried a quick maneuver to avoid it, however, he collided with the right front.
Janura denies that the two sites that are reserved for the flight attendant’s rest were sold.
"These sites cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company intends to sue the driver of the truck.
The agency will not wait for the verdict of the trial on the compensation of the girl's family but expects the financial expenses also on the part of the culprit.
Reform of the law?
No, for now
The reform of the law could bring greater precision on the movement of the stewardess on the bus in which for a year thirty expert members of a group of the Ministry of Transport have been working.
"However, they have not reached any concrete conclusions.
They are not too dedicated to buses, but rather to the points system, maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile during the ride,” says expert Hosin.
“The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewardesses something that threatens the safety of passengers in a significant way,” Hanzelka said, concluding that the control of safety on buses is the responsibility of the police and the Office of Safety at Work.
The hope of Dusseldorf is based in Frankfurt
The letter from the board of directors of West LB Bank to its collaborators does not lack great words.
By merging the units of the Dusseldorf bank with the DEKA bank, a central capital market of the Sparkassen financial group can be formed, as the letter says, published on Monday.
Bank West LB, breaking the ‘competition block’ with sustainable profit capacity would enter such a business.
In addition, such a merger may be a start for subsequent mergers in the area of regional banks.
This is how the text comes to understand, when a board of directors wants to show the ability to act in hard times.
Because like before, the West LB is under enormous pressure.
Not only on the part of the European Union, but also from the federal institute for the surveillance of financial services that has recently made clear to the government of North Rhine-Westphalia that there is little time left to find a solution.
For some time now, also from Frankfurt, there has been a lot of talk about such a union between the DEKA bank, which Sparkasse customers know for its investment funds, and the West LB.
Frank Waas, the head of the DEKA bank, presented the data after half a year in late August and said he saw no meaning in the bank’s merger, located on Mainzer Straße, with a regional bank such as Helaba or West LB.
But the DEKA board, which is now made up of regional banks and Sparkassen associations, instructed the board to begin negotiations with the West LB on common business activities.
In this it could be a business in the capital market or parts of it.
Of course, the negotiations have just begun, so it says on the financial site.
It is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the Sparkassen field that the name of the DEKA bank with its 3000 employees is among the most important entrepreneurs on the Frankfurt financial site.
In 2003 at one point the situation seemed so that the DEKA bank could merge with the Rhineland-Palatinate regional bank and Helaba.
This initiative to create a three-party union was left without results.
As soon as the plans were made public, the Hessian government spoke out against Helaba’s participation in this project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
Instead, the Rhineland-Palatinate regional bank began dialogue with the Baden-Württemberg regional bank.
But the idea of merging the DEKA bank with other regional banks was always played out again.
But finally Günther Merl, the chairman of Helaba’s board, said he was against plans for coexistence with his bank.
Independent of that it seems to be clearer that the union of the different banks in the field of public law is necessary.
When the Bavarian parliament elections are to take place, the union of the BayernLB with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg could make progress.
For Helaba, this is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure to continue merging increases, Helaba will lack the partners to do that.
In the south the bank could only be a young partner, although so far it stood out much better from the financial crisis than the properties of Stuttgart and Munich did.
On the other hand, the Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Thuringia, which owns 85 percent of the Helaba, earlier this year avoided plans for coexistence with the West LB.
In any case, only the Nord LB remains.
But such geostrategic reflections form only one part.
On the other hand, it is about the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June, Merl asked a fundamental question about a business model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, to which the German Sparkassen- und Giro-Verband has so far given no answer.
In the end you can break down the West LB, but that, of course, is not the bank’s own desire.
Thus, also in the letter of the board of directors of the bank it is said that it would try to find a complete solution for the entire bank
As you can combine the coexistence of singular parts of the bank with the DEKA, that will show time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
For Elena it is the first time, for Luca it is the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena is attending as his girlfriend, and that’s why everything looks different, he says.
Behind them, next to a 5-liter barrel of Kaiser brand beer is built a huge bear tiger showing almost 200 Oktoberfest participants that low sounds know how to produce in their throat.
First Elena gives Luca a spanking, then a kiss.
From Bologna they arrived in Verona.
From there, from the parking lot next to the Porta Nuova train station, tonight at 11:45 p.m., three buses leave, "direction Munich, the beer party", expected to arrive at 6:30 a.m.
Three buses are planned mainly for Italians, one bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the corners of the parking lot next to their flag are singing South Americans, they had already begun to party at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with an artificial leather lining and glasses with silver-colored pins, owns these buses.
For five years they have been coming to the Oktoberfest, considering that only this year there are three excursions.
At night on the road there, during the day on the meadow, at 22.30 round.
Spending the night there means only unnecessary expenses, Marco says.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome reception with a Kaiser beer that was made according to Bavarian purity law, sickness insurance and the guide in German- Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night the buses are already on the road on the highway with the direction "Brenner"
No beer, not yet.
Quickly tranquility reigns on the bus, travelers are sleeping.
That's right, they'll still need the strength.
It stops at Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian license plates take another break on Highway 8 shortly before Munich.
Finally, when Marco’s group arrives at 6:30 a.m. in the parking lot next to the Prado de Teresa, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others meet, Marco has his last speech on how to proceed.
First, put on a yellow cap.
There, on the left is written "Oktoberfest", next in Gothic letter is the page of Marco's travel office on the internet: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: “When the doors of the tent of the campaign are opened, that means ‘going!’” Marco shouts in the early morning.
"Go!" March and occupy the back sites in the tent of the campaign.
"Don't take the places in front, because we're going to block it, and everyone with yellow caps don't sit on the same bench, scattered all over the space!"
A liter of beer, roars Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
Don't forget the tip.
Show the security people that we have a good tone!
As soon as he leaves his place, he will be occupied!"
Third, "This afternoon at exactly ten-and-a-half you have to get here!"
And now everyone is going to the Oktoberfest.
One, to mark the way, binds the yellow caps on the trees, traffic signs and even on a poster of the elections of a large Bavarian People’s Party.
You want to be able to recognize the way back.
It is the second weekend of Oktoberfest that is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
There are no exact data on the number of people; these are 50,000 people who make the trip over the Alps and stormily enter the tents, 10 percent of them all came especially this weekend from Italy.
The Munich police receive help from seven policemen from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross which makes a statistic of the nations present, where the Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, ahead of the English (about 60 assistances) and the Austrians occupy the first place.
The favorite tent of the Italian campaign is so called Hofbräuzelt.
Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
Germany’s banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peter Steinbrück said last week.
Good thing the politician used the word “relatively” and added that the German banking arena will also be affected by the critical trends.
And that happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), the Munich real estate financier who is listed on the DAX index, receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to withstand market turbulence.
On Monday a person who knows the situation very well told Reuters: credit aid amounted to 35 billion euros.
The part of the capital that the Hypo Real Estate will use has to throw interest.
The money comes from private banks as well as from public law banks.
The cause of this is the losses of the subsidiary Depfa.
According to one report, state financiers with the money that was borrowed for the long-term projects financed them only for a brief period – which now, due to mistrust in the markets, is no longer possible.
In the first half of the year the bank’s cash capital reserve fell by 95 percent, 2.37 million euros, also the share of equity lags slightly from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Compared to the same period last year, continued financial investment revenues and net profits from financial operations fell to zero, imputation revenues for debtors and some securities also those from the dissolution of provisions of credit businesses tended to fall by more than 70 percent, by 5 million euros.
Only thanks to the high and many revenues from the repayments of the restructuring compensation expenses of the former Depfa group as well as the repayment of interest under the federal tax code and the organized businesses for the consortium companies, the negative balance could have a deficit of about 16 percent more.
After his privatization in 1990 the former state financier was initially lost in speculation with industrial loans for real estate, which served as a reason for the founding of the Aareal bank.
Since much money could not be earned from financing state projects, the Defa began to devote itself intensively to projects in the area of infrastructure and the financing of community projects by private and state-owned investors (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and diversified.
Now the Hypo Real Estate has to make amortizations on the value of the subsidiary that will have an “essential material effect” on the consolidated profit and loss account of the group, it is said very inaccurately.
It is a fact that the dividends have been cancelled.
By 2007, they had been canceled by two-thirds.
After the acquisition of Depfa, the Hypo Real Estate became an important state and financial institution in the field of infrastructure.
As the bank does not own customer deposits, it, compared to other banks, turns out to be more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market.
With the bankruptcy of US investment bank Lehman Brothers, which happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank loans went down essentially because the banks were saving their liquidity.
Every year the Hypo Real Estate needs almost 50 billion euros to finance a portion of the Defa’s credit portfolios for its short-term refinancing measures.
According to the Hypo Real Estate report, the bank covers with a credit the need for group financing for a brief time and the company is assured of “the influence of international money markets that are now essentially not fit to function.”
Other sources say that thanks to this money refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, chairman of the board of Hypo Real Estate, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not need money markets for the foreseeable time.
The German central bank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Surveillance (BaFin) start from the basis that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now assured.
That’s what the bank’s shareholders and creditors have to expect.
But because of the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis there is no constancy.
It’s even conceivable that you don’t need funding in its full volume.
But the opposite cannot be excluded.
There was a rumor that at the last hour of Sunday the bank was still almost bankrupt, so temporary salvation can’t at least reassure worried people either.
The share price fell to 75 percent, 3.30 euros.
Loan courses, on the other hand, are really good.
While priority debts hardly change, borrowing rates according to the position on the property registry tend clearly down.
Mostly the loans of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo are affected, and with good reason the loans whose maturities exceed 2009.
After the remarkable growth of the banking crisis and the acquisition of Depfa that affected the Hypo Real Estate, the current value of its loans that were once an investment for speculation must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While issuing banks, governments and banks that are little affected are still ready to support the system, in the meantime it can start from amortization of pensions within the term.
Or something is going to happen, which no one can imagine – the financial crisis is going to get over in the next 15 months.
But seeing the crossed news about partial nationalization, now the security that is already at its limit has become a justified hope.
That’s going to be a reason, because creditors will spend nights without sleep, breaking their heads over the decision about their isolation from enthusiasm.
Still short-term investors can put the end point and use transportation to account for new losses for upcoming exchange benefit compensation tax payments in the future.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bent?-Box
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to show up at Tachibana Highschool the girls started laughing: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word Mangas - in a report on exchanges she tells about Japan.
“The first day at a school in Japan.
I felt nervous.
Before I went to school, I was scared.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and go by train for 40 minutes to Tachibana Highschool.
I just had to find my way, thankfully I didn’t get lost.
It seems that the beginning of classes is not set as rigorously as in my home in Lower Saxony.
From eight in the morning the students come, at nine minus twenty starts a small meeting with the teachers, the 'home room'.
Before the class started, I had to introduce myself.
I am also not a person who speaks with pleasure in the public, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform I put on an old skirt from the mother of my host family and also a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Well, so dressed I put myself on the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I am from Germany and in a week it will be my birthday.
At this point I was very happy because I had already started to study this language for two years.
All 31 girls in the class have squirted, laughed and made signs and all the time I've heard the word "kawaii"
I already knew her from my sleeves.
That belongs to the survival vocabulary of Japanese girls and means "sweet, cute"
Then I quickly slipped into my place.
The girl next door had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was pretty quiet, but when the gong sounded, I felt really assaulted.
Everyone spoke at the same time, laughed and asked a lot of questions – at the same time it was very difficult to understand Japanese English.
Then in the playground everyone took out their benches.
My host family's mother also made a lunchbox for me - it's something other than boring pieces of German bread.
It had rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and something like tofu mass meat.
In most cases I have no idea what I like here in Japan.
Things are rare and have a new taste.
What is certain is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe except for plums marinated in salt, bufff!
In Japanese schools Bentos is not just a lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a bento made in a very artistic way for a boy and gives it to him in the hope of being able to get to know him better during a recess.
That’s what I read in my Manga-Comics.
I’m curious to see if I can see it here too.
“Why Japan?” my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend a year’s school.
Then he always answered:
"Well, because it fascinates me."
I have been reading Mangas for years.
In order to better understand comics and culture, one day I started to study some Japanese.
For me it was absolutely certain that one day I will travel there.
Also because I have a faint for tradition and customs.
They have great value here.
On the one hand Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand it is a harsh, disciplined and traditional country.
As everything is well organized, I still didn’t feel lost here even though Tokyo is the largest city I’ve ever seen in my life.”
Rats also have feelings.
It is said that a rat or a cockroach feeling danger flees, why is it also afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, a scientist in the field of neurology, is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can you control whether they, behaving in a similar way to us, feel the same way?
An internet magazine called "Edge" has been publishing contributions from famous scientists for many years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the chosen answers to the question What do you think is true without being able to prove it?
I think animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it so far, although we can’t even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case at least we can expect it because all human brains have the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we devote ourselves to other species and include questions about sensation and consciousness in general, we enter the unknown realm because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as other animals: it becomes dead, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, of which some scientists make conclusions about comparable subjective experience.
Of course I don't think so.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to infect our subjective experience with that of animals.
First, they almost always include the circuits associated by the human consciousness of the lateral prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex (because of their participation in short memory and executive functions that direct behavior).
This broad part is much more developed in the case of people than that of other primates and seems to be absolutely missing in other creatures.
Considering at least the aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex, including knowledge about who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to assume that even man differs from other primates.
Another peculiarity lies in the linguistic nature of man: Since most of his experience is linked to the language, that often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals may be excluded.
But even though consciousness would not depend on language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of animals, created as it is, in many cases would differ from most of our states of consciousness.
This is why it is difficult to explain how the consciousness of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, is not measured because it has the special hardware, nor is it analyzed through our experiences, then your research presents us with big problems.
Most of my interventions relate to the content of the conscious experience, but at the same time there is also another aspect of consciousness that would have to be easier for scientific research.
One could investigate the consciousness processes of animals without taking into account their contents, and that is what happens during the studies of short memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, the essential passes to the neutral correlates of consciousness rather than to causal mechanisms: The two may or may not be alike.
Interestingly, this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex for visualization formation.
And what happens to the sensations?
I owe it to the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain is activated that is responsible for that, as is the case with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a state of mind in which we are when the activity of the brain occupies a space of the defense system (or its consequences such as body reactions).
Seen from this point of view the sensations are very attached to part of the cerebral cortex which distinguishes primates and especially man.
From the point of view of linguistic nature they follow classifications of fine sensations because we can differentiate and classify states with the help of words and grammar to be able to describe the states of others apart from ourselves.
For example, Antonio Damascus, on the other hand, thinks that the sensations are derived from the simple activities of the parts of the cerebral cortex responsible for the body and brainstem feelings, the same thinks Jaak Pankseep, but he focuses more on the brainstem.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can absolutely refer to different types and their sensations.
For theoretical reasons I cannot go against that, but I consider it unlikely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel as fear, possibly that feels in two cases as well: But how can you control if rats and men behaving in a similar way feel the same way?
Seeing the danger a cockroach runs away, why is it afraid?
I am of the opinion that the similarity of behavior does not yet prove the similarity of experience.
It is true that neuronal comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain stems, while cockroaches do not have at least one brain.
Is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
Even if it is possible to test it for men: How can it be tested in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly also cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how you can prove it.
I prefer to investigate the emotional behavior of rats than emotional sensations because their sensations are supposed to be fundamentally distinguished from us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and the tongue).
In any case, progress in the field of neurology is expected here as long as the same is measured for rats and men.
Since I don’t research the language and consciousness of rats, as well as sensations, I don’t know if they exist.
It can be said that I do not see beyond my nose, but I prefer to move forward than to work permanently without results.
Well, I'm a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: deadline for Poland and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the deputy prime minister, said preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of the president and the prime minister.
“The government sees UEFA’s decision in Bordeaux as a test of confidence in Ukraine’s ability to host the European championship together with Poland,” Wasjunik said.
“But that’s not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to begin and in both countries there is a lot to do.”
The schedule of construction and reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in the host countries is lame.
Possibly the number of stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
Now we have to do work with great speed,” said Ukrainian association president Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA is not going to take our eyes off us."
In Poland, a more radical step was taken.
After numerous scandals, the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish association PZPN and replaced it with independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The commission met at the request of sports minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is “a serious danger that the PZPN is not able to follow the rules,” Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we assured UEFA President Platini that preparation for the 2012 European Championship is not going to suffer from that."
Only in the last season many clubs in the first division were convicted because of downward manipulation to the lower category, finally also the division council had to be postponed.
Dennis Quaid indignant
She wanted to promote a new film, she was talking in an interview about private life – and she has problems with her ex-husband: Hollywood star Meg Ryan appointed her ex-husband as an adulterer.
He gets angry and counterattacks.
The Late War of the Two Roses on Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid's ex-partner: Eight years after their divorce the two Hollywood actors publicly show an unpleasant fight between them.
Last week in an interview with American magazine InStyle Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for the marriage failure: “Dennis was a long time unfaithful to me, and that was very painful.”
She knew the size of her infidelity only after divorce.
The reason for the revelation of private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - a story of the failure of a marriage is told.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to the designation of him as an unfaithful husband was clear: This is “unheard of that Meg tells the stories of our relationship in another version,” the 54-year-old told “New York Daily News.”
Among other things it is very “sad” that Jack, his 16-year-old son, will again “remember in public the pain and changes, all of which means a divorce for a child.”
While Ryan lives alone after a divorce, Quaid is remarried and is recently the father of twins.
And so ends his statements highlighting: "Whatever my life goes on.
I’m happy because I have a wonderful family that’s fine.”
Airline and hotel ticket prices are falling
In the first half of 2008 air tickets and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper compared to last year’s.
According to a current study, airfares in Germany became cheap up to 50 percent.
Airline tickets and hotel overnights became cheap again – this is a study by American Express’s travel and financial services provider.
The company has analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter saw a big change in the second half.
After prices in the hotel market continued to rise for many years, overnight stays in many places became cheap.
Compared to last year, between January and March prices in 41 of Europe’s 48 different cities rose on average to 6.9 percent.
From April to June prices have already fallen to 3.6 percent compared to last year.
Trends were more noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay less than the year before.
According to American Express, the reason for that was the weakened dollar rate, which was the cause that “the interests of American tourists in travel diminished.”
The decrease in hotel prices is also much more noticeable in financial centers such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial concentration points such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices have risen to 26.3 percent and thus break a record in Europe.
In the first quarter, airfare prices also showed upward trends:
Because of rising kerosene prices, Economy class travelers had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-haul flights became even more expensive up to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, airfare prices in the Economy class, compared to the previous quarter, dropped on average to 12.5 percent, but price changes for the Businessclass and Firstclass were small.
In Germany the price change was more noticeable than in other European countries:
From January to February prices rose to 11.9, in the second half they fell to 23.6 percent.
According to one study, prices for domestic flights in Germany even halved.
The cause of the price change is partly the rise of the weak economy, the company explains.
In many parts of the airline travel market, demand is falling.
On the other hand, there is great competition for the Open-Skies treaty that liberalizes aircraft traffic between the US and Europe.
The signal of the tense situation is the cancellation of flights of non-profit distances on airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 declared bankruptcy - in Europe alone there were 24 airlines.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With one goal and simple methods the SV Hamburg becomes the leader.
Luhukay from Borussia to him still does not go out to make the goal eleventh.
Kristoffer Klein presented the forced landing of national team player Marko Martin very well.
Gladbach's player started playing late and failed by making a goal.
Everything he meant by reacting to what happened, he could read clearly from his lips.
I just knew he was right.
“We need a second goal,” Hermann Rieger whistled at the cockpit entrance of the Hamburg stadium.
Nothing special happened in the catacombs, the rest time was over and most of those present were back in their places.
Rieger was nearly three decades of HSV physiotherapist, enjoying a very high reputation as one of those who were part of the group.
That is why his request was noted by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach nodded and raised his fingers as a sign of assent.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, Hamburg’s head coach.
His order was the same: wow, the second goal!
But that was not done.
“Not everything was nice to see today,” added Marcell Jansen.
Bastian Reinhard had also wanted to have him “more relaxed”.
The 1:0 result (1:0) Hamburg have to thank Mladen Petric (11) with their header impact; and also to the situation that the very weak Gladbach team could not show all their strength to the weak Hamburg team.
“That was a dirty win,” Martin Jol said.
This Monday the SV Hamburg is going to be 121 years old.
On Saturday evening the spectators had already celebrated themselves, the blue sky over the stadium and the change of table on the video screen.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
“We know how to play it,” said Marcell Jansen.
He expects the table's partial ratings to correspond more to the league's velocity than to the dominance of his HSV.
The team with their late-compulsory players like Brazilians Neves and Silva, goal scorer Petric as well as Jansen who was removed from FC Bayern need time to reunite, but the team still can’t shine with their successes.
“We need more of the feeling and more of the dribble,” Jol demands.
After the Voting Defeat
On Wall Street, fear is spreading.
Early news of the failure of the banks’ bailout package dropped Down Jones for a period of time to 700 points.
That was the biggest loss of points during a day in its history.
Then the Dow Jones recovered a little.
Around 8:30 p.m., one of the world’s largest barometers traded a deficit of 5 percent at 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, lost more than seven percent and fell to 1548 points.
At this time the biggest loser on the Dow Jones was American Express which lost nearly 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of almost 12 percent.
No title could win in value.
Goldmann Sachs shares lost nearly 10 percent.
Only a few days ago a major investor Warren Buffett had financially participated in the company.
The bailout plan plans to make resources available to buy so-called “rotten” mortgage stocks.
But the sum will be paid out of the way but step by step.
As compensation for that, the state has to receive stock option receipts for financial associations that during course development can be charged to reduce the financial burden of the state’s cashier.
Stock prices in Europe and the US continue to fall
The billion-dollar aid to banks in Europe and the U.S. does not reassure investors.
The stock price of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is down and negatively affects the Dax.
Despite the state-projected bailout of the financial market, the U.S. Dow Jones Index continues to fall.
Losses on speculated shares of the Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank caused the German index (Dax) to fall into a large deficit.
Despite salvage actions by the federal government and private banks, the Munich real estate financier’s action a period of time lost two-thirds of its value, the Comerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax fell clearly below the 6,000-point psychological limit and listed a 3.7 percent deficit at 5,839 units.
All over the world, financial markets have fallen.
The opening of Wall Street Day in New York began with notable losses.
Investors fear the US government’s $700 billion bailout package isn’t enough to boost financial markets.
In the first hour after the opening, the Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the salvation project, the vote in the Senate may be on October 1.
The other European balls also knew only one trend: at first the FTSE index in London lost 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan’s top Nikkei after-profit index fell to 1.26 percent by 11,743.61 units.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell to 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the main Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75.
After the announcement of the capital expansion, Arcandor’s shares lost in the MDax.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim has signed up 23 million new shares.
In addition, the commercial and tourism consortium announced that the stakes in Thoms Cook will not be sold.
Dark matter influences the trajectory of space probes
For many years now, a mysterious phenomenon has caused confusion to researchers: Dark Matter influences the speed of space probes during the so-called gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity may not be as correct.
The space probe "Ulysses" spent almost 18 years flying in the universe.
Because the fuel pipes are freezing now threatens a death in the cold.
For years a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during the gravitational assistance to the maneuver, causes confusion among researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a maneuver of the trajectory of space probes during which they obtain an acceleration using the energy of the gravitational field of a planet, for example of the Earth.
That allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space probe used this physical trick as did the Ulysses Sun probe.
But what surprises researchers for many years: Missiles do not behave 100 percent as expected under the venerable law of gravitation.
Rather, they frequent speed irregularities.
Suddenly the probes have higher or lower speed.
Physicists could not explain this effect until now.
They called it the anomaly during the gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity describing the force of attraction of matter by the curvature of space may not be as correct.
Stephen Adler, the American physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, solemnly believes now as before that Einstein did not confuse and tries to explain the anomaly during gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, in what astronomers were left in the universe.
“The reason for the anomaly may be Dark Matter that may also be very close to Earth,” he writes.
Researchers in the universe have known about the existence of Dark Matter for only ten years.
Supposedly she possesses the force of attraction and her influence can be observed on other planets.
Dark Matter, on the contrary, is completely invisible which means that it does not send and does not reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially any visible light.
According to the calculations of the scientists, Dark Matter makes up at least one fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
As confirmed by the Italian foreign minister, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt must be released.
The Sudanese kidnappers had demanded millions of ransoms.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shootout during release.
Five Germans are kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations on the rescue have already begun.
The Germans always fall back into the spotlight of the kidnappers.
The newspaper WELT ONLINE reports on the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are apparently released.
The same information is presented by Egyptian state television, Arab television broadcaster Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
After the news about the release on the Italian broadcaster Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, the Italian foreign minister, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages are released.
"We now control his health," Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian escorts are well and are in security, state-run Egyptian television reports.
The 19 participants of the desert expedition are on their way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shooting before the hostages are released: According to descriptions by an Egyptian security guard, the hijackers were ready to end the abduction, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six hijackers.
"The problem has been solved.
They agreed with the rescue,” the guard said.
It was all about “receiving the hostages” when suddenly “this surprise” came.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers killed six kidnappers and detained two of them in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money had to hand over the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper El Masri El Jom, referring to a German mediator, reported that the release was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of his safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to release the female hostages after having received the ransom.
The men had to be detained until the kidnappers had a safe route to flee.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on this report.
Abuse of stepfather "led to suicide"
According to the court, years of abuse by her stepfather led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after he admitted eight counts of indecent assaults.
The Royal Court of Truro, through an investigative study, learned that he had regularly tied up his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote on a confessional paper: “I feel responsible for his death.”
The court learned that Ms. Randle committed suicide at her Mutley home in Plymouth on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
In the season when the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to tie her and blindfold her before performing her sexual acts, while her mother was working in a pub.
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to Cornwall.
Her stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms. Randle, who spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court what some of Ms. Rande’s friends had said about her, who after being a great surfer and cyclist, now seemed “emotionally dead,” as if she had “renounced life.”
In April 2007, his real father, Terrace Randle, found the woman dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
Mrs. Rande is supposed to have killed herself by suffocating herself through a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter’s stepfather, who wrote a confession letter ending with, “I used to tie her up and blow her eyes.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Trerise: “You are a very strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been a horrific experience, especially when you were only seven years old.
This nasty saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even clearer, if she hadn’t, the issue probably wouldn’t have ended in the courts.”
“I’ve noticed the effect that according to the description made by Stephanie’s father and mother the abuse had on her daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have had a promising, successful and happy future.”
An officer charged with data loss
The BBC has been informed that a Cabinet officer who forgot some secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a business trip by the Ministry of Defense, left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before being handed over to police.
This is probably the least serious charge under the law and does not imply any indication of intent to commit a crime.
BBC Defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the conviction had come as a surprise to many in the English administration.
“They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet,” he said.
The employee, who cannot be named, is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause that relates to the safeguarding of information.
The Royal Law Service noted that the officer must be charged by the Metropolitan Police, because of the highly sensitive entity of his work on the Secret Services Committee.
The forgotten documents contained secret information about al-Qaeda and the security forces’ capabilities in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision Monday morning and immediately moved from his home to a secret place.
Construction companies face the price of B&B
In Britain, construction companies could face a price tag of more than 80,000 pounds sterling after the bailout of Bradford and Bingley.
The government, in effect, provided GBP 14 billion to protect the deposits of the bank’s 2.6 million savers.
Interest on the loan will be paid by all companies that use the money of the savers, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director General of the Association of Construction Companies (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers it "humiliating" that companies and their members have to pay
Eventually, the $14 billion loan should be repaid after Bradford and Bingley’s mortgages are redeemed.
However, the interest that is earned in the meantime is assumed to be charged each year to the 700 financial companies that have deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that all 59 construction companies are included in that number.
It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently ... are called to pay today the price of institutions that have been far less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
That is, each company had to pay in proportion to bank deposits, and mediation companies had to pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to GBP 450,000 in 2009.
This means that companies will have to recover 81,000 pounds sterling to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the Commercial Association of Construction Societies, told the BBC that this situation is unfair.
“It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently in the growth of the real estate market are called upon to pay the price produced by those that were far less cautious.”
According to the BSA, there is no data to indicate the failure of any society since 1945.
“We will need to look into every aspect of this issue in the coming weeks to find out what options exist to protect construction companies and their members in the face of what could be a relevant price.”
The interest earned in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year until March.
In 2010, it will be a full year of interest payable, which can be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are mutual organizations and there are no shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interest rates on their savings.
Milk price rises by five pence per liter
Residents of the Jersey Plateau will have to pay more for their milk.
The Jersey Dairy newspaper has announced that the highest price of dairy products will rise by an extra fivepence per liter as of next Monday.
This is the second price increase this year, following a two-pence increase in February and subsequent research by a consulting firm.
Traders can decide for themselves whether they want to apply the price increases for their customers.
The last time the highest milk price had risen before February was in 2002.
Ex-Prime Minister of Bangladesh denied bail
A Bangladeshi court has rejected the request for bail for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, meaning she can be taken to jail when she returns to her country.
His advocates said the court did not grant him bail, accusing him of extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) from an entrepreneur when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of several corruption allegations against him.
His longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina’s return to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the coming weeks, but his party, the Awami League, has demanded that the country’s military-backed government first grant him full freedom.
Correspondents say that while she was given parole to go abroad and receive medical treatment, it is unclear now what the terms of her release are or whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say they will appeal to the Supreme Court against the High Court’s order.
“The Supreme Court rejected the bail petition for Sheikh Hasina arguing that he could not obtain bail because he was already being treated abroad on probation,” his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
"We're going to file an appeal against the order of the Supreme Court."
Her supporters argued that she needed bail to return to her country from abroad and prepare for the December election.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to his homeland after Oct. 17, an Awami League leader said Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the army-backed provisional government took power but was released in June to go abroad and receive medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all charges they are charged with.
Fears for the campaign against polio in Afghanistan
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan have not been able to take advantage of a recent polio vaccination campaign because of Taliban violence.
Last week, the United Nations carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that it was unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for safety reasons.
A U.N. spokesman said it happened despite promises by the Taliban that they would not have attacked or hindered thousands of officials while carrying out vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge on ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge in the Competition Commission following the decision that forced the company to reduce its stake in rival broadcasting ITV.
BSkyB has been informed by the Competition Appeals Court that it will have to reduce its stake in ITV by 17.9% below 7.5 percent.
Previously, the Commission said that BSkyB’s interests hamper competition and allow its unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its share package in 2006 in a deal that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti-Monopoly Office reported that BSkyB's acquisition of the ITV stake raised doubts about ITV's independence, and prompted the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
Everyone, including Virgin chief Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and regulator Ofcom, objected to the purchase.
BSkyB, commented that the obligation to reduce its package on ITV was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy, particularly because, BSkyB said, it would have surrendered its voting rights.
New Investigation into the Assumption of U.S. Lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the firing of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the inspector general of the Department of Justice criticized the action by administration officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Produrator General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by fears that lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Counsel Nora Dannehy is investigating whether officials questioned during the investigation have lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
“Serious allegations of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved,” Attorney General Glenn Bellas said in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine U.S. attorneys were removed from their positions by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At the time, the department motivated the decision by suggesting that lawyers had been fired for underperforming.
But it was later learned that lawyers had not rated themselves worse than their peers, and many observers concluded that layoffs would be motivated by political reasons.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked to prosecute some Republicans, high-profile members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of electoral fraud against Democrats.
These Lawyers Investigate and Prosecute Court Cases for the Government
They can be fired at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The next head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure from the layoffs, resigned his position.
A number of other Justice Department officials did the same.
The Attorney General's report is highly critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in the matter, and stresses how he had a "primary responsibility" for layoffs, who "abdicated" his leadership position and was "remarkably non-collaborative" in the process.
Other officials, including former Bush aide Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The Epic of Meat Loaf
Rock star Meat Loaf will be honored at the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will pick up the special award next week at the ceremony in London, said getting this recognition will be "an honor."
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album Meat Loaf won in 1977.
The Coldplay group are taking the nominations for this year’s awards and ranking all four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: “There are some songs that transcend time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them.”
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires an excellent vocal capability like that used by Meat Loaf.
An instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the hymn.
The song was first known as a single in the UK in 1979 and became number 15 on the chart.
However, Meat Loaf’s Bat Out Of Hell remained about nine years in the rankings and went on to sell more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including a surgical operation for his heart arrhythmia in 2003, after a collapse during a concert.
In 2007, an acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
Later it emerged that he had a cyst in his vocal cord.
Dark city street, often forgotten and perhaps ready for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, others simply serviced.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and long-time local residents, find it hard to pinpoint the location of the Extra Place, especially since many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and extends north of First Street – before I found Second Street – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
This little alley, more or less 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, resembles a dusty alley more than one active lane.
There's no sign.
It is practically impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that recently built luxury buildings on Primera Calle
who wants to replenish Extra Place and create a clean hallway to the shops and boutiques that are expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include old-fashioned neighbors who commented that they are delighted by the truncated lane simply because it is one of the last remnants of the block’s past before the appropriation of buildings.
However, the City’s Housing, Preservation and Development Department, which has control of the street, has no interest in owning it.
At this month’s Community Reach for Land Use Committee meeting, representatives of the Avalon agency outlined a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, preferring the street to remain in the city, called for a new plan to be presented next month, as Susan Stetzer, Community District Manager n.3 said.
"The city owns very few spaces today and we would like it to continue to own Extra Place," said Ms.
“We can consider Avalon’s proposals to solve the problem and manage the space, but we also want to ensure public access to the street.”
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that it wanted to repair the small street and install some seats, including some to be used as coffee, waiting to rent the spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street first emerged during this month’s meeting
But Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the street, it didn’t necessarily want to own it.
“Avalon Bay’s primary concern is the renovation of this abandoned alley and the possibility of turning it into a public area,” he said, adding that the sale proposal came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Preservation Committee, confirmed that it was a desire of the city to sell the street and noted that the agency’s mission is the development of the property rather than the management of that.
Compared to its more colourful surroundings, those of the Bowery, Extra Place has left a mark on history.
Some believe it got its name in 1802, when the large estate owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his sons and this narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The CBGB's back door, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened in Extra Place, but the street is perhaps best known for the photograph of the establishment that comes out on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
“The setting was magnificent,” said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the picture in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, pieces of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who write about the East Village bourgeoisization, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, however modest, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare, virtually unchanged piece, a stripe of the city that should be guarded.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made available part of a City History talk on Extra Place, published by The New Yorker newspaper in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a somewhat narrow and dead end alley, dark also by day and marked by rusty iron warehouse doors and window sills, with weeks old newspapers blown along the gutters."
With few exceptions, the street looked more or less the same on a recent afternoon.
A rat healed through the back of the street and stood near the door that was used to enter the CBGB and that now houses a luxury clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and an empty bottle of beer about 22-oz were near a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some interns said they rarely paid attention to Extra Place, but suggested it could be cleaned up.
Mr. Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in its current state.
"I spent the best years of my life," he said, "in dark, wet, disgusting places."
The bilingualism debate: immersion in the English language
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidates’ positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former associate in California studies and director of studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
Effectively calling Hispanic voters is a difficult business.
The education proposals made by Barack Obama are an example of that.
Mr. Obama’s campaign notes that “African Americans and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” and this is a very true consideration.
To combat such differences in learning events, Obama’s education plan specifically advocates, among other things, “two-lingual transitional education” for English learners.
However, the open question for Mr. Obama is whether the commitment of bilingual education, which prefers classroom instruction in languages other than English, is effective in overriding the distance in the final results.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized elementary school in the eastern Los Angeles County region.
In this school the vast majority of students are Hispanic and low-income families:
More than a third of students, many of them newcomers, are learning the English language.
However, an incredible 100 percent of fourth-year students have been rated positively in the 2008 math exam.
and almost an equally astonishing 93 percent have mastered the English language and arts test.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient than that favored by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street School emphasizes review and practice, constant assessment of competencies, and does not tolerate any attitude of excuses.
Also, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the principal of Sixth Street, the school’s approach to English instruction to students is in “total immersion.”
Immersion in English means the almost exclusive use of the language in the treatment of the contents of the instruction.
Ms. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, “We’ve had extraordinary success with students like this one who came in from Mexico and that if you walked into the classroom 12 months later you wouldn’t be able to pick up what it was.”
“It works,” he said, “we think it works.”
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model to replicate by other schools with large populations of Hispanic-English students?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubts about the answer, but the idea of the politicians of his party on the issue of education (the National Education Associations have long been advocates of bilingual education) and his own constant support for bilingual education obscures the prediction of Mr. Obama’s answer.
While immigrants must learn English, Mr. Obama has recently trivialized the issue by letting people stop worrying about legislation that is only written in English.
and instead, he said, "you should make sure that your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close gaps, he should carefully consider the models of education that work well, rather than scorn or trivialize them.
Oil prices fall sharply after renewed economic fears
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday because of concerns that the U.S. bailout plan for financial markets may not be able to revive the economy.
Crude oil stocks fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel in the morning trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has fallen by more than $20 per barrel since Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by the financial crisis on Wall Street and a pair of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.29 per barrel in July, prices had dropped to nearly $90 per barrel earlier this month, before falling back, once again, due to huge uncertainty in financial markets.
The anxiety grabbed investors once again on Monday, despite congressional leaders saying they had reached an agreement over the weekend on the bailout plan, the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far from over.
The evolution that occurred in the last episode of the merger process confirms that Citigroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, according to what the government said on Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that, over the frantic weekend, the negotiations that led to the bailout deal “seem to have been unable to revive market sentiment.”
As the economic situation deteriorates, a downturn in demand for commodities, including oil, is expected.
“The outlook for global equity, interest rates and exchange rates will be increasingly uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
“We believe that commodities will not be able to escape this contagion.
From the product perspective, our most pressing concern is the assessment of whether the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China.”
Analysts at the bank have lowered their expectations for next year, as oil consumption drops due to the economic growth crisis and the forecast for oil and gas price reductions is 20 percent for 2009.
Second quarter of madness: team sets record
Having spent more time than anyone in Jets uniform playing defense over the last eight seasons, Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he saw how things unfold in the second quarter this Sunday, when the Jets turned a non-scoring game into a deflating game.
“I’ve never seen anything like that,” Ellis said.
The second quarter started after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played lazily under the shadows of the clouds.
At this point it happened that quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles achieving a 12-yard goal and suggesting the perfect omen for an afternoon, in which the evolution of the relationship between the players took a big leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the fourth, one of these when one cornerback crashed and another arrived with 10 seconds in the middle.
“I didn’t get out of my way,” Favre said of all the steps going to Coles.
"He's a one-player devil.
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people may think.”
While Favre and Coles were employed at the dam, the Cardinals' defense mistreated quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a walking shot and returned 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith pointed at another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was fouled by Warner Bros.
In the last turnover, the fouls forced by Bowens, could have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets regained the ball, Jay Feely kicked him 20 yards to win a final 34-0.
These are the biggest points the Jets have ever made in a quarter.
The team coach, Eric Mangini, asked him to describe the madness of this moment, he said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When both were answered - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can say I liked the second quarter a lot more than the third quarter.
They’ve earned a lot of points in a very short period of time.”
Rested Gebrselassie leads his world record
Once again, Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has demonstrated why many consider him the greatest racer in history, breaking his own world record at the Berlin Marathon this Sunday and becoming the first person capable of running the 26.2 mile race in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After the win in the accommodating flat race at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie shattered his previous record of 2:04:26, achieved last year in Berlin, by 27 seconds.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has set the 26th world record in a race of impressive length so he has set a world championship or world record for any distance, from time trial to marathon.
Last month Gebrselassie did not take part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in hindsight - that air pollution would aggravate his asthma problems.
Instead, he set out to run in Berlin.
In virtually perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, employing an average of 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners such as Gebrselassie and Kenya’s Paul Tergat have converted over long distances, the marathon record has shrunk by more than two minutes in the past decade, as Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After last Sunday’s victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that he had suffered calf cramps two weeks earlier and had lost a week of training.
It is evident that the suspension left him fresh, not oxidized.
“I’m very happy,” Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I had some doubts, but in the end everything went well.”
The athlete has been the subject of some criticism – especially in Kenya, Ethiopia’s Afro-Eastern rival – for the style of over-orchestrating his careers, generally avoiding encounters with many world marathon stars, relying on pacemakers as if it were a race track, and putting records ahead of the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the grandeur of Gebrselassie’s skills as a runner.
This Sunday, at the march of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached halfway through the race at 1:02:04.
Two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began challenging Gebrselassie after their pacemakers declined.
But just before three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie took one last push to break away from Kwambai, who finished second at 2:05:36, improving his personal best by nearly five minutes.
Kamathi reached third place at 2:07:48.
In the women’s race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, was a surprise and won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She also didn’t take part in the Beijing Games for what was described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and set her personal best record in nearly five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
He did a clever calculus race, leaving a quartet of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners to head off and then recovering them after 18 1/2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won second place at 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya finished third at 2:25:01.
In a separate city, the pride and trials of colored life
Hidden by the expansion of the theme park of the great Orlando, a few kilometers from the bright, noisy and colossal city, there is a quiet town, where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are very evident.
Eatonville, the first fully black-inhabited city incorporated into the country and home of Zora Neale Hurston’s childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: “the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 men of color, 300 good swimmers, many guavas, two schools and not a prison.”
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Fair in Eatonville to pay tribute to Mrs. Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, in many ways, the city she described – making it also a tourist stage by including it in the Florida travel guide produced by the Depression Season Federal Writers Project – remains a stand-alone place.
The city remains as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Mrs. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their true ideas with the white man, who “knows so little about us and doesn’t know what’s missing.”
Even now, in the year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has called attention to starting a dialogue on the issue of race, many remain cautious in front of the outsider.
“We are very cautious about the way our story is told,” said Jones Hortense, 59, a lifelong resident and a member of the city’s oldest church.
"It has to be right."
Eatonville has always been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is at the same time a historical model of black affirmation and a community of nearly 2,400 people living under a level of poverty twice the national average.
It is a literary center, but also a repaired example of the rural culture of the black South – sometimes disdained, sometimes praised – that was born out of slavery in America.
Not surprisingly, those who reside here are both proud and reserved.
And the preoccupation with the image of Eatonville really started with Zora, as no one here calls her Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her profound dialect books such as Mules and Men (1935) and Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed the city, just off Route 17, a road that runs through downtown Florida often forgotten in the history of blacks and human drama.
Having a concrete face in both life and literature, Mrs. Hurston took her readers to the store owned by the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then into more private areas.
“Out of the road to the left,” he wrote, “there is the modern public brown school with its white finishes, its well-maintained gardens and playgrounds, cared for by Howard Miller, as he can barely read and write.”
She also mentions widow Dash's new husband and writes that Glenn Lee "sells drinks of all kinds and anything goes with transient rooms."
So, in just a few hundred words, Mrs Hurston links Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Obviously, this Fodor didn't do it.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
"Zora described it as it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the Johnson girls Mrs. Hurston immortalized by quoting men who were singing colorless songs about their beauty.
He added: "Some people didn't like that."
Mrs. Hurston is still remembered here as a vivacious eccentric who returned frequently after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77, remembers that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in town, she did so without warning in a large Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that even today prides itself on dressing with dignity.
Most residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed sarcastically.
“People were always happy to see Zora,” Mr. Franklin continues.
But, he adds, swinging in his chair in a backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Mrs. Hurston was probably baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer in print.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten about her.
Although she was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only woman of color at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no great commemorative ceremonies, no great public readings.
“I don’t think her contribution to the world or her legacy was understood,” said Valerie Boyd, author of “Wrapped in Rainbows,” a 2003 biography of Mrs. Hurston.
A certain turn came in the '80s.
Orange County officials wanted to put a five-lane road through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the labor community’s main two-lane street.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to him relatively idyllic isolation from the community.
In the 1950s, the struggle for racial mixing brought hatred to the community.
“During that season, a bunch of white guys were going around the city throwing oranges and everything against the people sitting next door,” Mr. Franklin said.
“They also killed a girl once.
They threw him at a watermelon in the car.”
In a 1955 letter to Mrs Hurston he wrote to The Orlando Sentinel newspaper, criticizing the forced integration by the Supreme Court that, in Brown v. Board of Education "insulted rather than honored my race."
A Residents say today that the desegregation of schools, positive in some respects, had weakened Eatonville’s cohesion and undermined the confidence of its youth.
“Black kids used to be hugged – I remember this – they used to hug the teacher in the morning and at night,” said N.Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins’ daughter and CEO Preserve the Eatonville Community, a nonprofit organization.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students came from the same place.
"I wasn't embracing your teacher because he was white - there's a cultural gap there," Mrs. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped create the space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors, and artists who overcame prejudice, just like she did, with buoyant, confident, and lines like: “How can anyone deny himself the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Mrs. Hurston's anonymous tomb and began fighting to resurrect her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Mrs. Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in bookstores, reintroducing her into American canons.
The road project came just as Eatonville’s most famous daughter was once again in the spotlight.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Mrs. Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that road.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its road proposal.
“The resurrected idea of the five-way road would have been to put in what you would call curvature speed, a true civic pride,” Ms. Nathiri said.
Mrs. Boyd said it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road project has helped change the image of the city itself.
Outsiders like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to church from here in 1993, began appearing in large numbers, and residents began reviewing the past.
Eatonville entered the National Historical Register in 1998.
A new library (named Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a reappeared and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like a street of the past in a summer rain, in a city as small as the one that was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
Foreigners who come in search of Eatonville’s history, its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A permission in advance is needed to do most of the interviews, and some things - such as murals at Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the field - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs. Jones, a courageous and convinced teacher who has a soft spot for bright red, still fears that her island community may be misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, a higher level of native pride has also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville in the same way Mrs. Hurston saw her entire race: beauty, and all the problems, no better, no worse, and equally to the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, hardworking, silly, and mixed.
It is a sincere civic sense that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who is planning to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or by the Police Department, who said he might need some help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
“Most people, in case they dare to go down here, will have to think, ‘Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other,’” Kenon says after going to church on a recent Sunday.
“But if you really stop and take a moment to look at its history, it’s a very nice city.”
This way, in New York, everyone is talking about finance.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from kiosks and gigantic TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t realize they were in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that behind the glass facade of the honeycomb offices above their heads, the bankers and speculative fund managers that monopolise New York face daily the worst “bad day of the office” since the 1929 low.
Guys for home delivery keep ringing their metal tea carts through the sidewalks and carrying muffin trays for breakfast meetings.
Latino men continue to drag between loaded apartment buildings, just like human mules, with 50 eccentric print shirts hanging from a yoke across their shoulders. Office workers still wait in line for their morning take-away meal, and it remains impossible to take a taxi between 4 and 7 in the afternoon on working days.
Employees still wait to line up for their bagel to the sellers’ carts, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between four and five in the afternoon on weekdays.
It seemed to me like there was no crisis at all, until, this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts out there, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had calculated the time it took for the operation to coincide with the late afternoon calm at my local JP Morgan Chase branch, a queue of about 20 people was already waiting.
And not in front of the employee’s window, to withdraw cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer service bank, where lifelong customers order their checkbooks, tourists look for instructions to go to Macy’s department stores and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was later informed by Starr, my “personal banker of trust,” and they were in line for the same reason as me.
Unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks in places where they had been switched from, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They had drawn their money from so-called savings associations (a bit like a building society), credit unions and savings banks in their hometown whose whites only function within the state of membership, and who claim to treat customers as their family.
Over the past year, 15 of these banks have quietly failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went bankrupt, and as New Yorkers headed home Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion in savings deposits, was looking for a bailout buyer.
The office and store workers who stood in front of me, fearing another collapse, were moving their money to a bank in what is considered a safe haven, which is doing most of the bailouts on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have become financial experts in recent weeks.
A woman at my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, was referring to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and its grieving-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, was familiarly commenting on the matter as if they were complaining about a colleague’s inactivity.
And Lyn, fifty-something uniformed concierge of my apartment block, has changed the normal course of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my grocery shopping.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that "I now have all my savings in money market funds.
The switching is done, I’m not taking any risks.”
Muslim tombs desecrated as Austria approaches right
Heinz-Christian Strache, of the left wing of the far-right party for freedom of Austria and Filip Dewinter Belgian, affiliated with the far-right party Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present to the organization "Cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry traffic signs depicting mosques with a red line crossing them.
Police are blaming far-right extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that far-right political parties made huge gains in the country’s general election.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at the Traun cemetery near Linz sometime between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organized action.
Criminals sprayed Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David, over some of the tombs, but investigators think this may have happened because of an attempt to hide the real motives of hate-driven extremists against Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident was in any way related to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which came to Muslim religious when the month of Ramadan was over.
Meanwhile, Austria is preparing for a round of introspection after turning right in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that seized nearly 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had conducted a campaign focused on anti-immigration vehemence and some of their slogans were considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the Freedom Party leader who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against head scarves and burqas, and also voiced his opposition to foods considered related to Islam.
At his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a “European brotherhood” to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties intend to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of the ongoing Islamization policy in Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out immediately after the election, which have confirmed the far right as the strongest political bloc in the country, indicate that the change came mainly from young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Prohibition of travel abroad for Gary Glitter
Courts have banned Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, from traveling to France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the surveillance authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
Kent police issued a travel ban Thursday after judges produced evidence of Glitter's previous convictions for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Magistrates’ Court in Kent, but was represented by attorney Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: “On Thursday, September 25, at the Ashford Magistrates Court in Kent, police requested a provision to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd’s trips abroad as well as to France and Spain until March 25.
"Paul Gadd did not attend in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that he wished to travel abroad because he was under the sex offender registry.
He has to inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days
and it is also necessary to inform the police of the planned date seven days in advance of your departure.
Kent police said they would not discuss the individual case or Glitter's possible whereabouts in the county.
A Kent police spokesman said: “Kent police will do everything they can to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A Kent police spokesman said: “Kent police will do everything they can to protect children in this country, or abroad.
“From our point of view, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because here we have the systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
“Protecting the people of Kent is the main concern of Kent police and we work closely together to monitor the behavior of registered sex offenders in the county and minimize any risk that may exist to the public.”
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls, aged 10 to 11.
When Glitter was released he flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and he eventually flew to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted he return to Britain.
He probably arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on August 22 and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Magistrates’ Court in west London after Scotland Yard had successfully enforced the order to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had been jailed in the UK for four months in 1999 for possession of child abuse images.
A source at the Interior Ministry reported that Jacqui Smith, the Interior Minister, was reassured and glad to learn that Glitter had been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
"I catch the master off-stage to extract his character" Günther Bauer_Photographer
No heels, no ruffles, no premiere costumes.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of concentration in the interpretation to get the relaxed look of the man or woman.
On one side the artist.
The other, the person.
Inseparable except in privacy, in those moments outside the public, when finding the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of a hands, carefree because they are not going out on stage.
The German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatricality of some stagings with singers, dancers and guitarists with that lesser-known side of these masters.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of flamenco from different fields.
Included in the program of Flamenco Photography Month, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, growing every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco-people" "can be anyone people but, on seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on stage.
These people portrayed "on the street" are artists capable of conveying on stage passion, sadness, joy... captivating the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists you do not have to take pictures of the stage.
They carry their personality and character within.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the greats of flamenco.
With the flavor of the "Sing of the Mines" festival, Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to portray singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
They are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and the material, recall classical photography.
The application of different stylistic means breaks with the classical basis of the image, conferring it modernity, an idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, which evolves and surprises every day".
It is not the action of the dance, the singing or the touch itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, that captivates with his art the public.
The search for an encounter with the essential, with the goblin that becomes visible in a way of feeling, of being and of being are and have been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the gallery El Fotómata.
Famous flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, make up this selection of almost seventy photographed artists.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited in the exhibition.
Bauer’s passion for portraiture led him to repeat the idea two years ago with “SportARTproject.”
Although the concepts are different in “Flamenco-people”, the photographer admits that “I love to portray people, meet them and be able to enter a moment in their life, be it a long or short moment.
I think in photography portraiture is the hardest genre.
You meet or face people, characters, that sometimes you don’t even know, or that leave you only a few minutes to be able to take the photo.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true.”
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco bearing the title "Flamenco-people" is on display at the Galería El Fotómata, located at number 20 in Calle de la Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hercules, where it can be visited until next October 16.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "a recklessness"
It’s set in places he doesn’t know yet and talks about unknown issues, but still, Mario Vargas Llosa is committed to bringing forward the new project he works on, a novel starring Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and went through the Amazon.
The always-favorite Nobel laureate of literature confessed yesterday in his passage through the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that today occupies him "is a recklessness" and that "everything indicates that he should not write" the novel.
“If it were sensible, I wouldn’t do it, but I will do it and I hope to finish it sometime,” he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas, thought and words that for four days has seen a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people pass through the city of the Aqueduct.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the outstanding figures of the third edition of the party of the word and fulfilled the forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the Hay Festival award for being the writer most voted for by the participants - an old edition of Dickens' "Our mutual friend" - filled the capacity of the Juan Bravo theater.
Presented by Félix Romeo, he found before him a dedicated audience who was made very short the time in which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, revisited how his literary vocation was born, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of "pleasure to read" and "live more than he lived"; how he wrote with "his intense manner of discipline"
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people more unconformed", so he asked the writers "not to give up on their frivolity" and "take responsibility."
The climatology diminishes the fair of Pozoblanco that also runs out of regions
The festival of districts that closed the compost of the fair of Pozoblanco was suspended yesterday morning, after checking the announced rejoinders that the floor of the square was not in the best condition.
In this way, the company, according to Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
Weather inclementities have been primed with this fair, as finally two of its three festivities have not been able to be celebrated.
Saturday was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second bullfight planned.
The poster was composed by José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a lockdown of Castilblanco
Only on Friday was there a celebration.
In it, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and went out on his shoulders, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talavante saluted his two antados with greetings and an ear, which granted more tendos than his bullfight.
Even worse was El Juli, who passed through the coso of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
In his second bull, after an effort of relief, he won the bruise of a large part of the public.
They jump a control in Álava in a van with 2,000 kilos of hashish
Five minus ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Ertzaintza in the municipality of Armiñón (Álava).
The officers stop the two occupants of a van and they begin the flight.
His cargo, more than two tons of hashish, was not like to stop.
The officers chased them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old male, identified as A.A.J., the Basque government’s Interior Department said in a statement.
The arrested individual has been charged with drug trafficking and falsifying public documents.
The incident was recorded when several officials of the Álava Traffic Unit were carrying out a transport control on the N-1, as it passed through the town of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver disobeyed orders, accelerated sharply and took control.
The agents began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped a couple of kilometers later in the arcene, at which point its two occupants pitched to flee for the race through a forested area.
The Ertzainas finally reached one of them and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hash they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The back of the vehicle was loaded with hash bales, so they moved it to police stations for a thorough inspection and weighing of the drug.
In addition, officials verified that the registration had been "doubled" as it did not coincide with the collection in the van documentation, so the arrest has also been charged with a crime of falsification of public document.
The Ertzaintza continues the investigation to proceed with the arrest of the other suspect, who managed to escape the race as has been said, and to determine the origin of the drug seized.
The detainee, 28-year-old A. A. J., was transferred to police units to carry out the corresponding proceedings and will go to court in the coming hours.
Actress Heather Locklear Arrested for Driving on Drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda from the Melrose Place series, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the effects of some medication.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers while trying to get out of her parking lot in Montecito, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol told People magazine.
The witness detailed that at about 4.30 p.m., Locklear “was stepping deep on the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the parking lot back and forth, and going backwards he passed several times over his sunglasses.”
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who had apparently not initially recognized the actress, saw Locklear stop on a nearby highway and get out of the vehicle.
This person was the one who alerted the emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When police arrived, they found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"She seemed disoriented," so the agents took her to the specialized drug and alcohol center for a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and excess alcohol was discarded from the outset, although "as officers observed at first glance, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some medication."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the effects of some unspecified substance and entered the local prison at about 7 p.m., although she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left an Arizona treatment clinic where he was recovering from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian UI federation to assume its powers in the Silva case
Gaspar Llamazares, the general coordinator of the IU and deputy of the United Left, said today that it will be the regional federation of the formation that will have to make a decision on the case of the former councilor of Youth and Sports of the City of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after he was accused of performing favor deals to family members.
“I am very federalist for these things, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its competences,” Llamazares said of the performance that the party will have to adopt with which until now councilor in the Seville Consistory.
However, the leader of the UI argued that the need for “transparency” is present in the possible investigations into the irregularities that Silva may have committed: “IU has always advocated that such matters have the maximum degree of transparency.”
In the same vein, he stressed that the training has “strict ethical codes for all public offices.”
'May Blood', Garci's epic bet
Inspired by the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous uprising of the Spaniards against the French in Sangre de Mayo, the most ambitious film in his filmography with about 15 million euros in budget.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of a wide cast of performers.
Blood of May, with a footage of more than two and a half hours, premieres this Friday in cinemas, to become the future in a miniseries for Telemadrid of more than four hours in length.
A great admirer of Galdós' literature, José Luis Garci says he fulfilled this filming "a childhood dream", which should be thanked to Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid three years ago commissioned him to shoot a commemorative tape for the second centenary of May 2, Madrid, something he accepted as long as the story was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budget that the Community of Madrid has contributed in its entirety constitutes for Garci a "unique opportunity" to decorate with the decorations and the appropriate costumes the portrait of "a stunned Spain that was mistaken as the boss to fight for, since the struggle for independence led the people to enormous delay with the reign of Ferdinand VII", he pointed out.
But the filmmaker regrets not having had funding like Alatriste or Los phantoms de Goya - more than twice that of Sangre de Mayo -, so he has not been able to shoot some scenes shot in a script signed with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has collaborated for almost his entire career.
For this reason, the director of Back to Start, has focused on what is his usual way of working, the staging with the actors, with whom he usually rehears before starting shooting and to whom he does not cast, to seem "humiliating" and consider that "part of the director's job is to go to the theater and cinema to know what happens in the industry in which he works".
Many of the performers with whom he coincides in Sangre de Mayo repeat before his camera, as is the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Oscar nominee on four occasions - of which he won one - Garci considers that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the Blood of May itself, Seven French pool tables and the finally selected one, The blind sunflowers, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "which is the one that must be made known", he said.
With this film Garci does not expect any awards.
“In the beginning you think you work for posterity, then you realize you’re just working for prosperity, and now you’re just making one more movie,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabel Bayón recovers the essence of the Sevillan dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Sevillan dancer will pay homage to a Sevillan dancer as well.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana neighborhood and when she was three years old she moved to London with her family.
She was a free dancer and specialist in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, pioneering the liberation of women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated for the abolition of corsets that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe between wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me and I found it incredible.”
According to the dancer, "we do not intend to tell his life but to collect his spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested me flamenco clubs.
Thus, "the butterfly dance" suggested me a guajira, or "the snake dance" some tangos.
His dance was sensual and I was told that my dance is also within this aesthetic.”
The montage has two exceptional collaborations: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing Isabel again in one of his shows, as he did in the one of "The open door"; and with the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with who was his student.
"Matilde plays Tortola of Major, the character of maturity.
I am happy that I have accepted to perform in my work and I am very honored for it.”
The montage also features the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this type of artists who were always in love with them, and in all their extension.
The work also tells the life of this woman who developed in places as far away, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, as well as all over Europe, since she habitually resided in London.
“I wanted to remember her because I think she’s one of those women who have a huge influence at a given time and now nobody knows, let alone values her work,” Bayón says.
The show will start today at 8.30 pm at the Lope de Vega theater.
The publication of the "Diary of a newlywed poet" also closes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Recicençado" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities scheduled by the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía to celebrate the "Trienio Zenobia and Juan Ramón's 50th anniversary" (2006-2008)
In this way, the "Trienio Zenobia y Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the reissue of this work, with the International Congress that has been held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel House Museum and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That jewel of light", which was inaugurated last May and that, after traveling through the different provinces of Andalusia.
Likewise, the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Recicensado", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America likes itself less without Paul Newman.
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "Absence of Malice," and gives the idea of the helplessness of American cinema, and all of America, to the shocking idea that Newman is gone.
It was hard for them to give him an Oscar.
It has been retired since 2007.
And it was known that he was very sick.
It's still been a mess for everyone.
“Sometimes what one feels is beyond expression, and I have now lost a great friend,” Robert Redford cried, “my life and my country were better because of their existence.”
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
A father of cinema and homeland had died at a particularly dark time, fearful of terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem on the ground, desperately searching for motives for dignity.
When time is so hard and without virtue the men and very few beings you have left to admire, you don’t have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
It embodied for everyone an almost Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and advocate for lost and won causes, from the drug-fighting foundation created in honor of his firstborn dead from overdose to his homemade, organic food brand.
It’s a gift to a country that has had a hard time overcoming a suicidal food culture.
The expansive wave of admiration sweeps through Hollywood without attending to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that not a man has died but an age.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was nothing short of the pinnacle of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
“He has left the bar very high for us all,” said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dares to try to live as Paul Newman lived: keeping the demand for probity high and to have a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today’s media jungle.
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is his example.
He divorced once but was then married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, whom he was faithful to when he surely had the chances not to be.
"But why am I going to eat hamburger outside the house, if I have steak inside?" he used to joke himself.
In heaven he is proud that on earth his daughters coincide with his fans, something not so common in America.
“Of all the great roles he played, none were as proud as devoted husband, loving father, caring grandfather and dedicated philanthropist,” they say.
The Imperfect Race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that some Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the 2012 failure, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday’s race, I say no!
The perfect race they called it, and in my opinion it’s been the worst race I’ve been in a lot.
A plethora of misconceptions that, of course, if taken into account as an assessment and I examined it, would be a very clear suspension.
But let’s go in parts and from the beginning.
Mistakes begin with the collection of the backbone, which makes you have to go before.
Which doesn’t seem bad, but if they already make you go give it all (including the chip to avoid queues in the race).
Well, no.
Here they only made you go to pick up the back (first purposeless, go only for that) and (after the relevant queue), surprise!, there was only size 'S' for the shirt (second purposeless, because I need a size XL)
In what world do we live?
Or is it because of the crisis that they have decided to buy only small t-shirts with fewer fabrics and cheaper?
Well, things like this are a minutia compared to the day of the race.
Apart from having to go very early to pick up the chip, the queue on arrival is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, something incomprehensible for a race where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, as expected, the race started and we had not yet left the backpack, although once it was done, the pickup was worse.
In addition, the rain lit the wait for more than 40 minutes, which was joined by conates of popular rebellion and assault on the cottage.
I think about 500 people will surely have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me won’t even show up with the right time in qualifying, because of the chip they gave me that, I guess, didn’t mark my exit properly.
Of course, if I were asked about the perfect race, it wouldn’t get into my thoughts.
So I think we will continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft seeks receptionist (virtual)
At MIT’s Emerging Technologies conference, Microsoft showed an advance of a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence without much intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as asking for a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move around the company’s campus) attending to what you hear in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the room, who they are - even remember what they wear - and listen to and understand the keywords of their conversations.
Also group those present by conversation groups.
In the sample video the receptionist detects a third person but understands that he does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks if he is there to visit someone and tells him that he will attend soon.
All without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week has been talked about far above a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and won’t have as many programs associated with it.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers came with the essentials instead of loaded with commercial bassoon, they would go five times faster – man, Steve, it’ll be for less.
Microsoft, version after version, has added features and "extras" to Windows.
The change of direction is appreciated.
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing importance, and also the software.
When Google Chrome came online, I was one of those who joined the theory that it was Google’s first step to competing with Windows.
Many rightly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential layer for the Hardware and Software to understand each other.
It performs the same function as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
It's true.
It will never disappear but one must think of the “death” of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but as relative.
What Ballmer has said this week is confirmation of this idea.
People are paying less attention to the operating system, and more attention to the web browser.
The computer boots just to run Firefox or Explorer – or Chrome – and every day we spend more time browsing than in the window environment.
What are half of the applications that come into the system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less recharged, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and that they are finally an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I bring a small example.
The photo from this post was taken in one of the Microsoft employee break rooms in Redmond earlier this month.
On the soda machine a sign asks them to use their search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the network.
Last week, by the way, a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was also confirmed.
It will not come in early 2009 but in the end, rather by pulling to 2010.
In Microsoft they will surely look for the joint release of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is becoming more and more computerized.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the street, will pass bill.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Côte d’Azur, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick’s Blood Diamond, as did Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola’s The Godfather and is part of the uniform of the muscular gay parish.
And if we start to enumerate stellar appearances, we can go back to the image of that forged pointed moustache that lifted weights in a walking circus.
In essence, it’s nothing more than the typical men’s underwear in cotton, tight and sleeveless.
The 'tank', which the English speakers call, but le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles stands out above all the others.
First, by its rumbling name - although familiarly known as 'Marcel' - it has to do with the sport because it gets its name, according to legend, from boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' stands out above the others for its excellent cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive shield and for the small Belgian flag (only recognizable) that the most emblematic T-shirt models wear as a detail on the neck.
And attention, because the Belgian firm’s production is not only focused on its tank tops.
It also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, navy t-shirts, babyies, mini shorts...
Clothing designed for underwear comfort.
It’s a shame to leave them as underwear.
They have too much charm.
“I want to be a young mom; the candidate doesn’t worry me.”
Her enormous resemblance to her sister hasn’t stopped her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Today, the Cruz sisters take their new fashion business very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
He has been in Paris in the promotion that the firm Mango makes in its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Warm and timid, win on short distances.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have devised for Mango in this new autumn-winter season, in addition to attending the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner of the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense but, at the same time, exciting day.
What is your new collection for Mango based on this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I love the cinema of the 50s and 60s; from there we draw many references.
Then, I really like to get lost in a city and watch the women go dressed, how they combine and mix their clothes, I do it a lot.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, everything comes together and they have a lot of ties in common.
Since I was a child, I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to go into my aunt’s closets and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to take care of how I dressed.
You know that dancers really like to make our styles for classes and rehearsals, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress when they give you the dressing room is when you really find the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for the designers and professionalism.
You turned 30 not so long ago, did you get into a crisis?
What's up?
I feel better than ever, I like 30.
I find that the woman is made, has experience and savors life with fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn’t scare me.
I have done the things I wanted since I was a child and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, are you thinking about being a mother or not?
Of course, I know I’m going to be a mother because my body asks for it and, besides, I want to be a young mother; I don’t want to miss it.
As for the candidate, I’m not worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the movie, you’re looking forward to several premieres you shot last year.
That’s right, and I want you to see the light.
I, who am a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, I want everything for now and of course, it cannot be.
I’m looking forward to ‘The Last Hour’ and ‘In Search of the Tomb of Christ’.
See what they look like...
A few days ago you debuted on a runway with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not like I went on a runway to model.
He simply called me Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, to invite me to go to London to participate in a charity parade for his organization 'Women for a Better World' and the clothes we exhibited - I took two pieces from our collection for Mango - was auctioning to raise money for this Naomi NGO.
People don't know that tender heart of Naomi.
So many things are said about her that, I know, I would tell you that many are not true.
Plus, I'm stuck with that good part she's involved in.
He asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if he comes to ask me to do the pine, then so too.
To benefit the women of the third world, whatever it takes.
Alcoholic drivers must install the ‘alcolock’
Interior wants the driver with three administrative penalties for alcoholemia, to have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents starting the vehicle drunk, or if it does not blow.
The initiative was already announced last June and is now included in the annual memo of the Attorney General of the State, according to which it is a pilot project that will last one year.
Its purpose is the reinsertion of the driver, so he will also receive a road re-education course.
In addition to the General Prosecutor’s Office of Segurida Vial, the General Directorate of Traffic (DGT) and the Technological Institute for Automotive Safety Foundation (FITSA) will participate.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once for drunk driving again take the car.
The alcoholock would avoid it as it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in exhaled air and prevents starting the car if the driver does not blow abtes; or when an alcohol concentration is detected is higher than allowed.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and would be at the expense of the sanctioned.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce violations by up to 65% during the first year of deployment.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people each year.
The measure adheres to administrative sanctions for two reasons: addressing those behaviors before they result in criminal offenses.
And facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done by ordinary means, and yet the necessary reform by criminal means requires a reform in an organic law.
The device is not yet available in the Spanish market in any commercial modality, although it has already been implemented experimentally in some commercial and public service vehicles.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote tomorrow on an initiative of the PSOE in which it proposes to install this system in school buses, as it has been carried out in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
At 5.40 p.m., the scheduled time of the program, the Spanish Air Force plane in which the Princes of Asturias were travelling was landing in the presidential hangar of Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was receding, but its rays still forced it to use its hand as a visor to see the real couple descending from the plane.
At the foot of the escalator, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours earlier he had asked the taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish princes were visiting the city to formalize an official trip.
- Oh, very good, then you won't be able to go to the airport to load at that time...
- No, no sir, she's Spanish but lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, very good...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the trip.
There are many waiting in the airport hangar glued to the red carpet and a military fence formed by 27 marines who play the salvo of honors.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, mane in the wind, very sober, does not use her usual peep-toes, perhaps she had been informed that in the DF threatened storm.
They give a smile and a short stop to the photographers before moving on to the room where the official entourage awaits.
At the door of the hotel in which they are staying, one of the four greats of the city, awaits them a reporter said Mexican television.
The best-endowed prize in fashion
Perhaps there is no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion award, that Paris and possibly there is no more exquisite and bont living designer than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of The Button-Mango Fashion Awards, to enhance the international projection of new fashion talents.
It has a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her designs in the Mango window at number 54 of Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried of excitement.
By the way, it is the second largest store of the firm in Europe and has just opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first is in London.
So many events, combined with the desire to thank the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the competition, caused us to end up with a luxurious dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
With the proximity of the most exquisite Chagals, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango, looked even more spectacular.
Nati, heartbroken and heartbroken, for the recent passing of his brother, put on a House suit and a few breath-taking props, and from the arm of his son Luis - a cannon nearly two meters long - accompanied Valentino in the presidency of his tribute dinner.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honors and is so gentleman that he ended up, next to the baron of Rotchil, without a jacket, because he had both lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who came to the store with trousers and shirt - of her own design - and for dinner was transformed in a sexy black long dress, was thrilled when on the night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, we were taught the ballet rehearsal room and she, remembering other times, clung to one of the bars and made a hide of 'grand plie'.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the walk through the palace’s outbuildings, but she showed us pictures of her son on her mobile phone beforehand.
The next morning we were able to rejoice the view with the presence of Olivier Martínez - another cannon that travels on a motorcycle - and by John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having asked previously, that there were no odors in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There is no 1000 but 1000 more ways to forget the chaotic and frantic everyday life.
And if that weren’t enough, they’re all gathered in a book that will bring relaxation to bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock almost hits when it rings every morning at 7 a.m., but it’s even worse to imagine getting wrapped up in the hectic pace that current life imposes.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are no one or two methods to combat daily burnout and disconnection problems with the world of work.
No, the number goes up to, nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Apart from yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of possibilities adapted to the taste and minutes of each.
The anti-stress work is called ‘1001 Ways to Relax’ and its calm will reach the bookstores by the hand of the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to achieve tranquility in areas such as work or through personal relationships, this ‘manual’ denies such a belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore body balance and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, disconnect your mind and focus on reading.
Speak asleep
Some kids talk at night.
I don’t mean those who wake up very spabulous telling us something that happened the day before, but children who talk while sleeping.
The first time it happens, you get scared, but it doesn’t really matter.
It is a benign sleep disorder called somnillochios.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one has been told that he spoke at night.
This phenomenon can appear very sporadically (once in a lifetime for example associated with a high fever episode), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a monthS...), the next day the child remembers nothing.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often related to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, nocturnal enuresis (fall asleep) or sleepwalking, but it doesn’t have to be.
As we have already mentioned above, they can also be associated with very high fever, stress or overexcitement situations.
However, it is a poorly studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
He may speak in a quiet tone of voice, loose words, a whisper or quite the opposite (crying, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where the manifestation is very intense it would be advisable to observe the child and consult with a specialist, to check if there is any issue that is generating a lot of anxiety and gives you exit in this way.
We have said that it is a benign disorder, so it has no treatment, unless it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with sleep apnea or a stress chart).
What you can do is take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child too much before going to sleep.
So look for quiet games and avoid programs or TV shows that are scary or a little violent.
With children who are very nervous and have a hard time relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire a certain inner calm.
This will allow the child to have a quieter sleep.
Once the sleeping pills appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember anything that happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him up.
It is useless, because he is not conscious, and you will break his sleep.
Even though he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's resting.
Remember that if you are very distressed during several episodes, it would be advisable to consult or find out what is causing so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the usual thing), do not fall into the temptation to question him for information.
You will not achieve anything, because when you are asleep you are not aware of how to organize your thinking.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming to say that, so be very careful in how you interpret the information and with the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child that you can question him at night to know his secrets.
Not even a joke.
That generates a lot of anxiety.
In short, don’t worry, it’s not a bad thing, it’s an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern at last!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found the way to victory on their field after a long period of scarcity.
Without having made a good match, the team created many goals and was able to make a goal to win the match.
The pace was not very constant during this encounter in which the aggressors had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann, who scoured the squadron one shot away, Illhaeusern was almost going to take the "power" and turn Fonderflick away, then with Hirn up, Romain with the tip of his foot or also Diebold would come to prevent Dannemarie's defense.
In front, we didn’t let the midfielder pass and left only Riahi in attacking position.
The start of the second half was crucial, first with two chances of goal from Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the scoreboard opening for the Illhousiens with the goal from Marais, well placed to pick up the ball rejected in a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the Illousiens scorer will not be able to savor his happiness for long and will be forced to return to the wardrobes a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not take the opportunity and will not be a problem for the eleven illousiens who backed down a bit to "compress" their defense, except in the last seconds of the game during which, after a major farfie, the ball passed very close to the transverse field.
Sarkozy Finds Angry Fishers
Before taking off to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will give a roundup for Brittany.
Faced with the demonstration of resistance by fishermen that strongly disturbed the entrances of several Breton and Norman ports last Monday, the president of the Republic decided to go last Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, to find their representatives there.
They promised to welcome him “in a constructive spirit” and hoped that he would “come with concrete proposals”.
This presidential visit coincides with the general meeting of the "committee of crisis" created by the Breton fishermen to achieve measures in the face of the increase in the prices of diesel, which marks a record when reaching 1.14 euros per liter.
According to Elysee spokesman David Martinon, the president “will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies to become competitive again and to save the conditions of jobs and remuneration of sailors.”
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy on their feet.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to reduce circulation in the Morbihan and Calvados, which have resulted in traffic jams of almost 10 km.
The marina of Quiberon has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-île have not been stopped.
“A filter barrier” has been placed on the Quiberon Peninsula.
Sailors on Monday showed their determination by burning tyres and wooden pallets in front of fuel tanks in the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as at Les Sables d'Olonne, in Vandea, where the oxen stayed in the port, or at Le Havre, where some twenty ships blocked the movements of commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantic region, stopped in the afternoon the blockade of the important Total refinery of Donges.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until this Wednesday’s meeting that will take place at the ministry to think about possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the “crisis committee” will have to think on Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the scheduled meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the national fishing committee, which did not sustain their movement.
"The strike will continue " because " the fishermen did not give up " and " they do not want to move to Paris ", announced for example Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the Lorient fishing committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per liter but consider that the financial equilibrium point of a boat can be reached only with a diesel with a price of less than 0.30 euros per liter.
The magnificent Paul Newman
The unforgettable performer of "Two Men and One Fate" has died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes greeted the film legend and committed actor, Paul Newman, who has passed away at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecast for 2008
The Brazilian aeronautical company has 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession that weigh on the world economy.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, maintains its 2008 delivery forecasts with 215 aircraft delivered, Embraer President Fredrico Fleury Curado said.
During the first half, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer relies heavily on the Chinese market particularly to sell planes ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG plans to sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group insurer, which has been in trouble thanks to U.S. monetary authorities, aims to sell more than 15% of its assets with the aim of repaying its $85 billion loan, according to Sunday’s edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is willing to study the sale of most of its services beyond its international life insurance and retirement insurance in the United States.
AIG’s board of directors met last Sunday afternoon to examine possible sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets AIG intends to separate from include its air leasing subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the insurer Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the Financial Times adds.
No final decision has been made on these sales, The Financial Times chases.
AIG must quickly make liquidity to repay its $85 billion loan granted by the Federal Reserve at the risk of the U.S. authorities taking 80% of its capital, diluting it with the proper proportion among current shareholders.
Analysis of the historic session of the Paris Stock Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange reported a historic drop on Monday after the House rejected Paulson’s plan to save the banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a never-before-seen loss of nearly 800 points, and the Nasdaq by 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Index fell from 777.68 to 10,365.45 points.
In terms of points, the largest drop in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded in the past on 17 September 2001, the day on which exchanges began again after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The technology-dominant Nasdaq index fell 199.61 points to 1,983.73 units and the expanded Standard & Poor’s 500 index by 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1,106.55 units, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed by the crisis at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the House unexpected rejection of the plan to save the banks that would have allowed it to regain some stability in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favor, representatives denied U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the media he called for.
Nearly two in three Republicans rejected his plan.
“That’s not a good signal sent to the market that Congress is unable to adopt a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of the FTN Financial.
“This shows how far the market had this plan,” added Lindsey Piegza, fearing that a project adopted within several days would come “too late.”
“If the project is really dying... the Fed and other central banks will quickly take over to manage the crisis, which would tighten credit conditions more,” Brian Bethune, head of economics and finance at Global Insight, said in a statement.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, “every day that passes is announced the fall of a financial institution” in the United States, stressed Ms. Piegza.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual last Friday, authorities arranged for the purchase of Wachovia’s banking activities by rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis dramatically accelerated, prompting emergency interventions for the benefit of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which shows that markets are facing “not just a crisis in the US but a global crisis,” the FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market has risen drastically.
The yield on the 10-year treasury bond fell by 3.632 percent, compared with 3.827 percent on Friday afternoon, and the 30-year treasury bond fell by 4.161 percent, compared with 4.357 percent the day before.
Obama wins the first televised duel
Friday’s first debate between the two candidates in the White House followed by another to find out who has triumphed between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
Unsurprisingly, Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel that has been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen says McCain’s performance, while honorable, was “not bright enough” to allow him to curb his decline in polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll published last Saturday gives Obama five points ahead (49% vs. 44% for McCain), judges that it is the Democrat who did well.
Among the undecided voters, who are the ones who count, Obama came out victorious with 39% of the respondents, while 25% of them awarded the victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama could confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected from his own candidacy member, José Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
He has good instincts,” Clinton said.
Seventy-year-old McCain highlighted his indisputable foreign policy experience, emphasizing his adversary’s “naivety” on these issues that were at the heart of this first run.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that...” he accused on several occasions.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president,” he said.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in Republican television advertisements.
Obama said it represented the future.
Without being baffled, he was concise and precise.
He emphasized his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
“McCain has not yet understood, while Obama has already understood,” he retorted, this weekend, a Democratic television commercial blaming the Republican for failing to consider the significance of the crisis’ impact on Americans.
“During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama denounced yesterday in front of 20,000 people who had gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina in heavy rain.
“Financial defeat clearly favors Obama, who is considered by Americans as the most capable character to save the economy on the brink.
“Next week could be a decisive episode,” said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the Democratic candidate, the current financial disaster “is the final consequence of eight years of poor economic policy implemented by George Bush and sustained by Senator McCain.”
Reaffirming that he would still cut taxes for 95% of Americans despite the Wall Street upheavals, the Illinois senator also pointed out that the realization of eventual energy independence of the country thanks to the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the creation of a safety and health system.
McCain wants to build a park of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudently, both candidates sidestepped issues that pertained to the $700 billion ($470 billion) bailout plan adopted yesterday afternoon by Congress and extremely unpopular.
" In Minsk, " Have you noticed the elections in Minsk? "
Young people and opponents were demonstrating last Sunday in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject in advance the results of the legislative elections.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered Sunday afternoon from the closure of the polling stations in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislative ones.
While no result had yet been announced, numerous young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: “the dictator has to resign.”
Some admit not having voted: “for what, since they will do what they want with my vote,” says one young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has put foreign observers in good shape in order to renew contact with the European Union is ready to effect a democratic change.
Sanctions, including visa bans for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections are considered clean for observers.
They were not according to the opposition.
“We have been placed next to the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the counting of the votes,” said Yuri Potemkine, the spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous regroupment of twelve parties.
“It’s a cosmetic change,” said Alexandre Milinkievitch, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, “because what matters is who counts the votes, and in our house, it’s the executive branch.
If some opposition MPs enter parliament, it is because they will have been appointed but not elected.
“But his entry into parliament may mean television appearances, meetings in the regions, and bills.”
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which has many debts in front of Russia, goes into crisis, and if we do not reform, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process would not recognize the validity of the vote.
He stresses that the turnout figures seem too high, and that the generalization of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) favoured manipulations.
“Have you noticed the election?” asks Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be at most five members of the opposition to parliament, those who are better suited to power.”
The silence of the night returns again in the square of October.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
The interview - Blood is safe again
Héma-Québec was celebrating its 10th anniversary yesterday, and its president, Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has once again become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, it regained the confidence of the public that had been seriously faltered by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood supplies administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
Faced with this drama and public discontent, the Government of Canada conducted a public survey in February 1994, presided over by Judge Horacio Krever, to clarify the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations to prevent such a disaster from happening again.
While Judge Krever was slow to present their relationship, certain provinces then created a committee that aimed to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee fulfilled this mission.
As a result of the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Héma-Québec to supply Quebec and the Canadian Society of Blood to supply all other provinces and both territories.
“In 1998, when Héma-Québec began its activities, almost 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec,” recalls Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
After making a lot of efforts to improve the safety of blood products and a lot of work during the years that followed, we have regained the trust of the public,” he says before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the Quebec population had confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary recalls, however, that “trust is extremely fragile.”
Since its creation on September 28, 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we witnessed in Europe the birth of numerous cases of the human variant of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Décary says.
And we didn’t know if this disease could be spread through the blood.
Then we rely on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which when we do not know and when a serious disease can emanate from that, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, we institute measures of exclusion.
In April 1999, we denied the blood of people who had been in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
But, a few years ago, it has been proven beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted through the blood.
This episode thus showed us that the precautionary principle that was applied made sense.”
In 1999, a much more sensitive HIV detection technique appeared on the market: nucleid acid tests that allow to detect directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus and not that of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used until now were based.
Nucleid acid testing shortened the period between when the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
We were able to reduce this period by less than a week.
This substantially reduces the risk that certain donors are unknowingly infected and that we cannot detect them.
These improvements significantly reduced the risk of getting AIDS from a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
“That means we’ll have to distribute 12 million blood products before someone is infected with HIV.
Thus, since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will be more than 24 years before a case of transmission of HIV by a blood product occurs.
I think you can now receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to restore health without worry,” said the head of management of Héma-Québec.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
It is never known which pathogen might emerge in the system.
Last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
You have to be constantly vigilant,” Dr. Décary pursues before stressing that in addition to a secure supply, Héma-Québec must also provide for a sufficient supply.
“The needs increase as the population ages.
Since anti-cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need an injection of red blood cells or platelets.
The aging of the population also has consequences on the blood donor network which brings together on average only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation.”
All people in good health, 18 years old and who meet the admissibility criteria, can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who propose their blood are not accepted, because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they traveled to a country where malaria reigns, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
“With this 3%, we managed to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
The shortages are very rare.
But members of this donor network must be renewed as they age and can no longer donate their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to retain it and incite it to be a regular donor.
Since current life is very unbridled, we rarely find time to spend an hour donating her blood,” says Francine Décary.
With a budget of $297 million annually, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public umbilical cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered biomedical waste is filled with blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
“We celebrated a few weeks ago, the placing on the bank of our thousandth sample of umbilical cord blood and it is expected to take out more than a thousand of these per year.
We would have to start proposing it for grafts early next year,” says Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood-taking program as very popular.
“Many mothers are disappointed that they can’t enjoy this,” because Héma-Québec doesn’t have the resources to propose this complex and costly program in every hospital in Quebec.
Softball - The Impact in the Semifinals
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semi-finals of the USL first division, thanks to a 3-1 (4-3 in short) win at the expense of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive game of the quarterfinal series, at the Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After the first half without a goal on any side, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many goals.
Roger Levesque was the only one who beat Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Recall that during the first game of the round-trip series on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 loss at Starfire Complex in Tukwila, suburban Seattle.
The impact will be measured to the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
On Saturday afternoon in Minnesota, the Thunder lost 3-1 in the return game to take it 4-3, but the Whitecaps agreed however in the semifinals 5-4.
The Impact is expected to face Whitecaps next Friday and Sunday, but details of the series will be confirmed today.
In brief – Kovalev’s victorious goal
Canada’s No. 1 team is ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn encouraged the attack in a 3-2 Canadian free throw barrier win against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec racked up two assists, and Kovalev picked up a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolor in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal.
“I’m not ready yet, the Russian warned.
"I need another game to feel comfortable."
He tried to play as hard as he could in the first half, Guido Carbonneau scored.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a beautiful ovation.”
Charest takes care of the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out launching elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party ends, Jean Charest was yesterday in Juan-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), tries to get elected during today’s by-election.
Rejecting the Boundaries of Our Last Great Northern Frontier: Such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force by staying on the big lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
They were parading, on three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric reservoirs, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Big media like during the election period.
The prime minister thinks the election will take place this fall, although he made it clear that his schedule was very full.
The "Northern Plan" is the fourth side of a "vision" that the prime minister intends to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes an agreement on labor with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmonies with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the speeches of the prime minister recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory to the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was “a jewel to the immense potential,” but gave no term, investment amounts, or precise priority in future projects.
What could especially be more developed are: particularly hydroelectricity, the forest, but especially the mining sector, doped by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond," according to Mr. Charest's enumeration.
This "twice as big a territory as France," is our home, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it home to us, but it is in us,” he insisted, as if to show that he solicited a national founding myth.
Quebec was greatly built thanks to its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold rush at Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
“It belongs to us, it’s our future,” he added, after taking a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map behind it.
The North, 70 percent of Quebec’s territory, comprises a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said at the press conference.
“It’s a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line in which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the occasion presents itself, I reiterate that position on the part of the government,” he said.
In addition, “with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North,” he said, referring to the Northwest Passage, which will open each year due to melting ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers it a duty to occupy the territory.
And the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The prime minister said the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former deputy of Ungava’s Quebec party), have already begun consultations with about 30 communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) plays an important role began some work.
The prime minister does not rule out an important meeting, “not necessarily a summit,” but a meeting in which “a common vision will be given.”
The development of the North would be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan “will be concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this “vision” as one that is in continuity with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
“Like the liberals who preceded us, we have thought otherwise to transform challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a large cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s rise to power.
One of the adopted resolutions proposes to rename the Beauharnois Plant in Adélard-Godbout Reservoir.
“From Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, in Lesage who made the Quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Bourassa who made James Bay our party knew how to forge the future,” said Juan Charest.
In the press conference, he invoked another reference, that conservative, the "Roads to the North" program of John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
Touching on the topic of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr. Charest stressed that its commissioning is scheduled for 2012.
“This stays among us, but I plan to be there,” he confided to his militants, eliciting applause.
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April that elections would not take place in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of a vote this fall, which the law allows him.
He points out that his schedule is nonetheless full, particularly because of a federation council mission to China and a Quebec-New York City summit.
The weekend general council provided the liberal chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly "constitutional aspirations" that had no problems to be accepted: the Liberal Party of Quebec in particular calls for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also hoped that Quebec would appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they would have a veto over the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the opposition side, we welcome the broad lines of the Northern Plan with skepticism.
The head of the Quebec party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the North Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, coming to power in 2003, renounced its application.
If she had done so, “we would have made progress today,” said Ms. Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (vote that took place today), Françoise Mercure.
The Quebec Democratic Action seemed to support the government’s adoption of a Northern Plan.
“But what is desired is that this is not just a show,” said leader Sebastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns on vacation today.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former minister of "Justice" (oh irony!) in the Harper cabinet, who was allowed last summer to say that Luisa Arbour was a "shame" for Canada.
To dishonor this woman who has waged an incessant fight for justice and who deserves our admiration for what she says all about the relations of the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are facing a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its national who is locked up in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
It is a government that in no way takes into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the facts that are blamed on him happened.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, renounces its promise and lets a child soldier live in inhumane conditions.
He's the only one who hangs out with a fake justice to assess the guilt of the defendant.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, support the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order for him to enjoy the benefit of a fair process in Canada.
It is this government that closes its eyes to torture: it cares little if a young adult is psychologically destroyed, no doubt forever after so many years of extortion.
We do not yet realize that, but we are witnessing at this moment an insidious erosion of our rights, of our freedom and of our “democracy,” that is the word that Harper continues to repeat and that makes no sense.
The time has come when no morals exist anymore: we can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen as the so far minority head of government wants (what will happen after October 14?).
Many voters believe they will find salvation in a party that praises Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government renounced what it did to the reputation and dignity of our country.
Mr. Toews, the shame is caused by this resignation and nothing else.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice president and director of Canadian mining firm Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold claims that the world’s largest gold company attempted a defamation lawsuit of six million euros against three authors and a small publishing house in order to provoke a “transparent public debate.”
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of defamation persecution, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to harm anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to their own?
The outcome of the lawsuit is of little importance, the authors and publisher of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defense and to fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of the miner.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly arrangement that will gag the opposition as well as scare anyone who dares to re-examine the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is in front of public opinion that he would have had to present his view of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in several of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually done by changing ideas and not by knocking.
It was enough for the miner to open her books, her files and establish a real debate, through the newspapers, the media, the publications and the funding of independent search teams that could have clarified the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to trust public opinion and rejects petitions and letters of support for the authors of Noir Canada.
Could Mr. Garver possibly explain how he can ask for a “public” debate disregarding his views?
According to the vice president, this word seems to designate only highly paid lawyers and not for all Canadians; that represents a very limited view of the concept.
In a democracy, critics also have the right to speak.
What he doesn’t understand – or what he doesn’t want to understand – is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does so mainly because it rejects the brutal way of mining.
This audience is willing to listen to Barrick and to judge him, but based on civilized changes of arguments, and not within the framework of what many people perceive as a gag-persecution (persecuting the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just filed a request with respect to the authors of Noir Canada urging them not to use this word anymore).
In addition to Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, Barrick Gold’s trial is a direct attack on the freedom of university search and truth, essential for all democratic societies.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and make a debate about facts and interpretations, which represent the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and argue about subjects that displease the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, under penalty of many persecutions, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have a right of reply.
The university world, to which we belong, has long known how to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s disproportionate persecution clearly shows that, contrary to what he purports, he has no desire to make a transparent debate.
It’s a loss for the university world, but also for public debate in Canada, and it’s time for governments to put devices in place that limit this kind of abusive persecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation: Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally came to an agreement yesterday on the most important economic bailout plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan that aims to curb the financial crisis that has shaken Wall Street for months has yet to be confirmed by both Houses of Congress.
It envisages in particular: better control by those elected to implement it, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money invested, new provisions to contain the number of houses embargoed for non-payment, as well as a right to control the salaries paid to the managers of the companies rescued.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Republican Representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday at the end of a two-day marathon of negotiations.
“We have made great progress toward an agreement that will be effective in the markets,” said Bush administration Representative Henry Paulson.
“Everything has been done to cover up the economy and ordinary Americans in the face of the current crisis on Wall Street,” she said.
“It’s the bottom line: If we don’t do this, the trauma, chaos and disruptions to Americans’ daily lives will be immense,” said Rep. Judd Gregg.
Negotiations had ended very quickly in the last few hours because they feared the effect would result in a further failure in the mood of investors.
The last hour they had set was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the U.S. presidential election, who have adhered late to the negotiations, were rather supportive of the agreement, not forgetting however to express their discontent with being forced to reach this extremity.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama was given certain provisions to reach the agreement, particularly the one that would allow owners to retain their domicile and over the salary of the leaders of the surviving companies by the state.
When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, they are not to be congratulated.
But these measures are necessary,” he said on American television.
His Republican adversary, John McCain, questioned on another network about whether he would vote for the proposed plan, replied that: “I’d like to see the details, but I hope to vote for it.”
“The important points I read [show] that it is something that we will have to digest and with which we will be able to advance.
He said the option of doing nothing is not acceptable.”
The $700 billion plan aims to buy from taxpayers’ money the dubious, risky, and unsold assets of American financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis caused by the bursting of a housing bubble that first led to the sinking of risky mortgage credits before spreading to other more common forms of credit bonds (PCAA) and causing a liquidity freeze and a break-up of banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of Republicans who had the first draft agreement changed last week.
We believe we’ve come out of stagnation since Democrats accepted that certain “toxic” assets of struggling companies are only government-insured, rather than purchased.
With the goal of curbing the toughness for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision that if the government had to assume losses for five years with this program, it could impose new rates that would aim to help it recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of $250 billion to which another $100 billion may be added if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of another $350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote by Congress.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get stakes in rescued companies that will earn him dividends in case of profits and that will be able to sell again when the storm is past.
The federal government will have the possibility to delay the embargo procedures concerning housing obtained with real estate loans under this plan, as well as set limits on the remuneration and on the cash compensation paid to the executives of the companies affected by the crisis.
The plan’s architects would like to see it submitted to the House of Representatives vote from today and the Senate vote next Wednesday.
Despite all your efforts, you are still not sure that your plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest yesterday against this bill, both from Republicans and Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told his constituents that “with all evidence, Washington doesn’t want to understand.”
“We have a very serious financial problem.
There are solutions.
But not that of profiting from taxpayers.”
Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman, who is an animator for a small group in Congress, presents the problems differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred professors of economics, including three Nobel laureates, wrote to us to tell us: We ask Congress not to rush and carefully examine the path that must be taken,” he said.
At this very moment, in Europe, we again had proof of the global nature of the crisis.
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it had given up buying its bankruptcy competitor since losing 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) during the U.S. risky real estate lending crisis.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of Europe’s twenty largest banks and ten largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
Instead, we regained a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It’s just something that savers and families will appreciate now that times are uncertain.”
During this time, across the English Channel, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank suffering from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all outstanding loans at Bradford and Bringley Bank and more than 41 billion euros ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it is the one that would buy the branches and bank accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a Committed Icon
His blue eyes represented his triumph for so long.
Did the American actor with a charming smile break free from his narcissistic side?
Yes and no.
His modesty, sensitivity, and a talent that was evident will also have taken him away from the power record of true sacred monsters.
What a great runner!
Paul Newman, who died Friday at age 83 from lung cancer on his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last American film icons of the fast years.
He is less phenomenal than Brando, whom he resembled a lot and who was long regarded as a rival in cinema, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the burst of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes magnificent children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
No excessive ego, the ultimate brand of quality.
Because in it was projected an entire country in love with the self-made man, the wounded Pacific War fighter, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art at Yale, then frequented the Actor's Studio in New York, before succeeding in theater, on television and soon in cinema.
This man who advocated for civil rights was also the car driver who ranked second at the Le Mans 24 Hours in 1979, dubbed by a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
Also disappears with him the secret sides of this secret star, discreet and committed, allergic to the scandals of the world of spectacle that we do not know very well.
He is an honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman’s death caused cinematic dizziness this weekend, as his big roles clash on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of American art in perpetual change parades through it.
Many memories come to mind as the charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on Tennessee Williams' adapted zinc roof in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we evoke his sensitive gentleman Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have gone down in the history of cinema.
This delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano in Robert Wise’s Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role destined for James Dean, repeated after his death, that truly cast Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic manga in the sumptuous movie The Sting, Oscar for Best Picture in 1973.
A bittersweet billiards player and avenger in Robert Rossen’s magnificent film The Hustler (1961), he will repeat the character in Martin Scorsese’s The Color of Money, which earned him his only Oscar out of nine nominations in 1987.
This face that changes with the years, it was him.
Still him.
The times change during his career.
Young people know him mostly thanks to George Roy Hill’s Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans saw him again in 1994 on The Hudsucker Proxy by the Coen brothers.
With one final Irish Mafia godfather role in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the curl was curled.
Contrary to several film legends who left the career quite early, Newman stayed very much in the film world, denouncing Hollywood, its golds, its splendors and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, with humor, "as a challenge that lives in " underplaying " and that judges its performances too supported.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the papers came for a long time without doing anything.
However, he played the role of a young gall less often than a marginal one: neurotic, alcoholic, bastard or desperate, whose traits reflected the rebellions.
As a director, Newman revealed sideways his true pudic sensibility not well known.
Her film Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (according to the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, described a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott to overdose dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son to him, a work of modesty and sadness.
“Among the many tributes that were unleashed yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (who had worked together on The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very sadly: ‘My life and my country were better thanks to their existence.’
Generosity, love of existence are important traits of the deceased actor.
On the other side of his legendary career, he also hides a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester against Hollywood excesses.
We will have seen much of his face reign over the jars of vinaigrette sauce, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, although it began as a gag.
The profits from these sales were given to their Foundation for Children in Difficulty.
Newman, rather than contenting himself with his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there.”
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of such a lucid and generous American artist.
In short, a model citizen.
What did they produce at the Zuschlag & Co. invoice factory?
Very soon, on October 8, the criminal trial against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of committing frauds of significant damage, in a business manner, continuously and in an organized form in addition to other crimes, including the falsification of documents.
According to the Prosecutor’s Office, they used the funds obtained in public tenders for their own purposes, often justifying the fulfillment of tasks with false invoices.
The public funds and that of the municipalities - in total about 65 million HUF - ended partly in the treasury of the organization Fiatal Baloldal and partly in the pocket of individuals.
The method, which was made known by the researchers as well, was to justify the collection of funds obtained in public tenders with false invoices behind which there was no actual execution, the different associations never fulfilled their obligations assumed.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were fake.
For this they obtained the notebooks in the market of the District of Józsefváros and the circular seals were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question of which company should be made the counterfeit invoice was decided among others on that tour of the Upper Region of the Balatón to which János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
The latter confessed that for this purpose he had to choose hostels and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for his consumption and these served as a model for making the invoices that he presented, among others, in the competitions of the Ministry of Youth and Sports Affairs, in the Ministry of Social and Labor Affairs, as well as in the City Council of the Capital.
These invoices were mostly signed by István Lados and his accomplice András ?ri, who, according to our information, wrote the necessary reports to obtain the public grants.
During one of his "study trips" Sides chose a brewery.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and his accomplices, this gastronomic center provided food for a group of ninety people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However - according to the center manager - so many people do not fit in that place at once.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb Jövért Foundation – later called Együtt to Harmadik Evezredért – was full of formal and contextual errors.
For a hostel in the town of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there in one night, however the bill contained one hundred and thirty people.
But the manufacturers of fancy invoices also exaggerated when they pointed to the gastronomic center Pigal Kft. because in the bookkeeping of the same - according to information given to the Prosecutor's Office - there were no documents in the name of Jobb Jövért and Hoppa.
Gyoz Farkas, the manager of the company, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned by the prosecution and shown the invoices, he already knew it was fake documents.
"On the label the name of our company and the NIF appeared in the wrong place."
He added: in addition to the formal problems, he also did not agree that according to the invoice one hundred people were accommodated, since they have only eleven rooms in which not so many people can fit.
In addition, meals were also included in the bill, while the restaurant has not worked for a long time.
The enthusiastic invoice makers also did not know that the travel agency chosen in Budapest exclusively organizes trips abroad, so that on the cash payment invoice foolishly indicated as a service a trip inside Hungary, which also did not coincide with the practice of issuing invoices from the agency.
In addition - as was known during the investigation - VAT was also included in the document, even though travel outside the territory of the European Union was tax-exempt.
Among other things, the VAT measure was also incorrect in the four documents issued by the Hotel Revfülöp Kft. for the Jobb Jövèrt foundation, since the services of this company are not charged with a 25 but only with 15 percent VAT, in addition the hotel employees only issued machine-made invoices but the invoice was manual.
In addition, the "shippers" also made other mistakes, as in the case of a company in which they put in the invoice as an activity carried out the road transport to which - it was known during the investigations of the prosecution - does not perform the company founded as an investment consultant.
Also due to formal differences - inappropriate format of the invoice, false stamp - it was known that the invoices issued for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapitvány, for XXI.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives denied issuing those invoices.
The counterfeiters also did not pay attention to the fact that when the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in the process of liquidation, so the person in charge of the liquidation process - according to our information - denied having issued such a document.
They sent the bills consciously.
Another group of fake invoice makers are those who were aware that they had to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, issued an invoice worth about four million HUF on behalf of the Együtt Foundation to Harmadik Évezredért.
The manager of the Collab Kft. - according to the indictment - was convinced by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue fictitious invoices.
Biogate Kft., currently under liquidation, also collaborated with Zuschlag and its accomplices, which in 2003 supplied invoices worth approximately HUF 5 million to the Jobb Jövért Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület Association and the Vörösfeny-Egyesület Association for non-economic activity.
There was no movement of capital either, because they then cancelled the invoices prepared but forgot to include in their documents this entity.
The following group of fake invoice makers includes those who have some connection with the defendants.
Ivan Kubatov, for example, was the suitor for the Ukrainian manager of the Budapest-based Delta Trio SL, which dealt with the fuel and vehicle trade.
This company issued numerous invoices worth approximately HUF 18 million in the months of October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer media.
According to the data of the investigation, these invoices were purchased by the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which since September 14, 2005 is under liquidation.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov should have also dispatched the documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued on behalf of the company invoices for Atlasz, Hoppa and for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapitvány collecting the amount himself.
Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian masons at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies actually worked because, according to the defendant, they did not receive work.
But he took advantage of these companies, since at the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company’s registration documents, issued invoices on behalf of the companies for organizations linked to Zuschlag: for Atlasz and for the Y-Generation.
Kubatov on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave a total of 15 invoices to different entities worth 14.2 million HUF.
The Prosecutor's Office considered that Kubatov received VAT and 10% of the amount of the invoices.
That man even took advantage of the Szi-Beri commandita society to issue fictitious invoices used in the Biztos Pont contest.
The Y-Generation and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted a contest in January 2006 to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), a public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
They got 500,000 HUF respectively, but they didn’t use the money for the contest’s objectives.
In order not to be discovered, five fictitious invoices received from the Works Team Kft were submitted to TMA.
These were the invoices found during the registration of the office that Árpád Kemecsei had at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
Some of the defendants will probably report in the trial - as they did in the Prosecutor's Office - the course of falsifying the invoices.
The most interesting thing may be the confession of the main defendant himself János Zuschlag, if he decides to dismantle everything.
For his confessions so far have not been very detailed and although he has repeatedly promised to talk about everything, this has not been done so far.
The question is: what interest does it have?, for perhaps in exchange for the return of most of the money - fifty million HUF - the socialists came to an agreement with him to make Zusi assume all the responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, for these days could even be offended, since to alleviate his prison conditions he requested house arrest, but was repeatedly denied.
While the numerous perpetrators of far superior economic crimes, who never returned the money, roam freely or can at least wait in their own home for sentencing, he has no chance for that.
Psychology of Overlays: Why Do We Spend More Money?
Auction participants are likely to spend more money and overvalue the product.
Neurologists and economists at New York University have discovered the neurological-economic underpinnings of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to the study published in the journal Science, people do not want to lose in competitions such as eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
Scientists tried to establish the neurological scheme of this "game" through experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played lottery, the other participated in an auction, and in the meantime the active brain areas of the people participating in the experiment were examined by the functional magnetic resonance system (fMRI).
In both games participants could earn money, but during the auctions, where it is essential to bet more than the other, losing the game intensified the operation of the complex called the stratum located under the cerebral cortex.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the “self-reward” mechanism of the nervous system.
Thus, according to scientists, the increase in betting is explained as a prevention not to provoke an intense reaction of the stratum.
To substantiate their theory, the economists of the scientific group also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment three groups bet against a person under different circumstances.
The control group was simply told the actual value of the product in question, and its members bet.
Another group was promised that if they won, they would receive an additional $15 in prize money.
Instead, the third group received exactly $15 before the auction, but in case of losing the auction the members of the group even lost that money.
Thus the only difference between the two groups was that for one the triumph stood out and for the other the failure.
However, by checking the neurologists’ hypothesis, the members of the group who played “against failure” were willing to bet even more than the members of the control group and the “win” group.
“These results cannot be deduced from any previously existing economic theory.
For until now they explained the phenomena of auctions only with the joy of winning and with the prevention of risks.
Only visual neurological methods helped resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so we now come to a third explanation,” said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at New York University.
Hepatitis: When should you go to the doctor?
Around 500 million people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is considered one of the leading causes of death.
An estimated one hundred thousand people are infected in this country, but only seven thousand receive treatment because many of the patients do not know that they are infected.
The name of hepatitis is the common name of different liver diseases caused by viruses.
The symptoms are very similar; liver infection and jaundice are characteristic, but their pathogens and diseases are very different.
Hepatitis viruses depending on the pathogen are spread through two main forms: foodborne hepatitis A and E (for example with water or contaminated food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body moods (sperm, vagina mood, saliva).
Travelers are advised to protect themselves with vaccines against the A and B viruses, against C there are no vaccines.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating the infected food, manifested by poor general condition, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that, jaundice appears on the skin and on the white of the eyes, the excrement becomes clear, dark urine and healing can last as long as two to three weeks.
Every year one million people die in the world from cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that according to the calculations, only one in ten infected receives pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment it can produce liver cirrhosis and even cancer.
Most infected people do not know that they are sick because this disease agent gradually destroys liver cells and often the first symptoms only appear 20-30 years later.
Premature recognition, systematic medical check-up, is therefore very important.
This disease is much more common in three groups: people who had blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and those who wear tattoos.
There are currently about 200 million people in the world who suffer from chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can be discovered with routine laboratory control as well, it is worth consulting with the family doctor when experiencing some unknown symptoms.
The disease is cured if it is discovered in time, it is possible to exterminate the virus from the body, so that it can suppress the infection and prevent cancer.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized in 2004 by organizations representing the sick.
Its aim is to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and the importance of their premature recognition.
Does it hurt less who believes in God?
According to recent research, religious faith has a calming effect that also alleviated the death of the martyrs of Catholicism.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment: they analyzed that religious belief in how it influences human pain.
In this unique experiment they applied electric shock to 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists, while everyone was looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the human brain scanning technique, it was verified that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
This experiment is the first in the series of researches in which scientists, philosophers and theologians from the different departments of the University participate alongside the academics.
The analysis took place as follows; they fixed a flashing instrument to the patient’s left hand, which applied the electric shock.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to fix their gaze on two paintings; the Virgin Mary, the work of Sassoferrato of the 17th century and the Lady of the Arminian Leonardo da Vinci of the 15th century.
The researchers hoped that the Virgin Mary spectacle would provoke a certain religious mood among the faithful, while they chose Leonardo's oil because it was not too different from the other, and they thought it had a reassuring effect.
Patients spent half an hour on an MRI scanner, during which time they received 20 electric shocks in four successive parts while observing the religious-themed painting or the other.
Catholics said that when they looked at the Virgin Mary they felt “safe” as “protected” people, “they were reassured and peace reigned in their hearts.”
When they looked at the religious-themed picture, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo’s work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any image so shocking you can achieve a similar effect with atheists too, you just have to find the right image.
“We should find the portrait of a person they feel very positively about, like for a mother or a father,” the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright celebrated the outcome of the investigation.
“Exercising faith should and in many cases really changes our personality,” Wright said.
After these formidable results only one question remains: what effect would it have on the regulation of pain if the faithful were shown the Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of his size?
Would the vision of a high-quality Virgin Mary yield even better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On its tenth birthday, Google can say: it can be found both in people’s pockets, and in the sky above their head; it knows where they spent their holidays, which doctors they visit, and what they’re interested in.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s executives, this is still not enough.
On the other hand, skeptics who make a parallel with Orwelian vision do not see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main goal is to gather as much personal data as possible about its users, and this is necessary in order to meet the original goals of the Google founders: “Let’s gather in one system all the information in the world!”
According to the Google leader, the company, even after ten years of work that turned the world around, is still in the early stages of the effort to be able to process all the information.
Asked what is going to happen in five years, Schmidt said: I would like Google to be able to answer questions like “What to do tomorrow?” or “What job would be best for me?” – however, the software will not be able to answer seemingly simple questions as long as there is not enough user information.
Not all Internet users are aware that during their browsing on the Web, the search keywords, IP addresses and pages they passed through are accurately stored at the end of the search.
Thanks for example to Personalized Search that debuted two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, they can re-check what they were looking for before, what they opened and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized searches -in this same logic will be based on the Recommendations, on which the system will offer us products and services based on the preferences previously defined and stored.
What will happen if they take advantage of my data against me, if they collect information about my activities? - ask those users who worry by seeing the information monopoly of Google.
In most cases rather the potential represented by the company is what can be fearful and not remorse, fear of punishment, craving for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is a confirmed fact that they not only retain, but in justifiable cases also assign to third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing that protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most debated example of recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, when Google handed the Brazilian government information from its Web page, called Orkut, to identify the pedophiles.
Instead, Internet users who care about people’s rights were relieved in May when the company along with the EFF, the organization for the defense of electronic rights, successfully demonstrated in court that it was right in its dispute with the FBI: according to the sentence, Google will not be forced, by any of the points of the constitution, to provide any information requested by the FBI in secret.
(At the same time the federal government managed to get its pretext to enforce the Child Protection Act passed years ago, about fifty thousand web addresses and a thousand search phrases, but without getting the individual users’ search lists, or the complete lists of web pages and keywords of the last two months.)
This is how the opinion about Google is quite contradictory: criticized by those who fear providing their personal data because they think that their privacy, their private life, is harmed when they start using Google services, and they rebel against it as against multinational companies with a conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, netizens and users from other countries, see in them the future generation, the "vanguard corporation", not so its rival, Microsoft, cataloged by its Windows as conqueror of the World, however much they both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code or money for their applications, the code is open and the free program package is constantly updated and seems more youthful, more collaborative than the practice of the official software giant.
But it can also be because the geeks see precisely the very problematic relationship between people’s rights and the Internet that came about precisely because of one of the most mentioned keywords in recent years: the Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about collaboration, leaving intentional footprints behind us and taking advantage of the available communication channels, and while the measures of these vary individually, the essence remains the same: showing ourselves.
A normal young person can have a profile on numerous collective pages, from Facebook to Shanghai, and can even link them with other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm that offers a list of their music habits, after that they can include them in a tracking system such as the FriendFeed or the Blip.fm, you can also have a blog, on which automatically appear the latest photo galleries that are stored in the Pilickr or the Blip.fm.
We can know numerous cases from which it emerges that for example the bride, seeing the flow of photographs of the next morning from common friends, finds out who spent the night before her fraudulent boyfriend or they can fire the employee of a company because he writes his sincere opinion on his blog about the company’s direction: one thing is certain, the definition of private life was completely revalued.
A person’s “on-line” life is what they show of themselves – this is the definition that lurks behind the behavior of today’s youth.
And anyone who wants to hide something, or at least wants to dodge Google’s monopoly, can do it (starting with the Scroogle, for example, which uses Google’s search system, but leaves no footprints).
There are many people who do not want to register on the collective pages to prevent them from being found, but they can replace Google’s “online” applications, from word-writing software to image and newsreading applications with alternative versions that do not connect with giant servers or prepare the most perfect profile possible about us.
Public opinion almost openly expects the day Google shows its true face.
The company with its current value of $156 billion is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising surfaces threaten ad agencies’ revenues, while services that are being introduced more and more quickly cause serious headaches not only for other developers, but for Microsoft as well.
Critical observers, however, will find the contradictions alarming as well: for example, the top management flatly rejected employee protest after doubling the price of the company’s childcare center, considered the unlimited number of employees’ feeding too expensive, but all this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 Google yielded to pressure from the Chinese government and the company according to the agreement leaked all the good information from the regime.
One of the company’s internal regulations says that they will not announce any new service in advance, but only when it was already ready to work, which if it is certain is that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will be able to turn to the world: while some believe that Google’s scanning and archiving project of books and magazines will acquire such dimensions that the company will soon be cited by our own health system, others have it in our profile.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database, will be able to provide a good raw material for writers of science fiction works, the Scroogled, novel of the popular Cory Doctorow, describes in Orwelian form that future, in which a man only of Google data can be described alarmingly well.
Two minors helped erase the fingerprints of the perpetrator of the double murder of the city of Izd.
Police have questioned two minors about the double murder of Izd who, according to substantiated suspicion, helped to erase the traces of the crime, a spokesman for the Borsod Province’s General Police Office said Tuesday.
The girls acknowledged the crime they were charged with, and are currently being charged with the crime.
The two minors - according to information from the Hungarian News Agency they are two girls - will be able to defend themselves in freedom.
For complicity they can receive up to 5 years in prison.
The defendant in the double murder of a 23-year-old man has been in pre-trial detention since Sunday.
He is accused of murdering several people out of premeditation and greed.
During the investigations it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum to a 53-year-old man.
The defendant did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday last week he summoned his creditor to the headquarters of a company in Izd, where he killed him and then also killed the victim’s 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI information, the young man was prepared much earlier to commit the crime, because he committed the murder with a weapon previously hidden at the scene of the crime.
Police discuss with an expert the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange submitted an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros – about five billion Czech korunas – for one hundred percent of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles, despite the fact that the Czechs have previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
Ninety-nine percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which in a few months wants to sell 60 percent of the shares.
The Czech economic newspaper E15 reported that the offer of the Poles has been the highest among those offered by those interested in the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, so far they have offered the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the worst new owner among those interested would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and he did not rule out the possibility that the Prague Stock Exchange would disappear in the future.
Experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at about 5 to 10 billion kronor.
According to the shareholder agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is investment bank Patria Finance with a stake of approximately 25 percent, followed by Banco Ceská Sporitelna with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
Major European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday dedicated to the deepening international financial crisis speak of a "second 9/11".
The global financial catastrophe is due to the American president - says the Republic of Rome - the president has not even been able to get the support of his own party for the hastily made bill, which aims to solve this desperate situation...
Instead of a new “Pearl Habor,” which billionaire investor Warren Buffett was talking about, it’s more correct to talk about a “second 9/11.”
According to a part of the Madrid press, Washington is the scapegoat.
In the opinion of El Mundo, it was the mistake of the political leadership of the United States that brought the world economy to the edge of the abyss.
The danger of the collapse of the American monetary system is growing more and more, and this will then reverberate throughout the world.
Although Bush’s plan was not perfect, after the congressional vote the danger arises that Washington does not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air – precisely when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism takes place.
This threat cannot be ignored, says the Tages-Anzeiger in Geneva.
Some states today can still throw life belts at shaky financial institutions, thus saving them from bankruptcy with taxpayer money.
But if as the dominoes collapse even more banks, then neither the new funds nor the new improvisations will be enough.
Long-term need for EU member states to put aside their nationalist selfishness and centralize control over fragmented financial markets.
Financial institutions in crisis received more than 100 billion euros on Monday alone - recalls the Viennese Der Standard, adding that concerns are increasingly real that, as the Americans did, European taxpayers will also have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis.
The EU has so far not dealt seriously with the crisis that passes as a cuneiform across the Old Continent.
The “saviors” will not have to present hundreds of millions of euros immediately, but it would be good if they defined: in what cases is it justified to use taxpayer funds to avoid a greater evil?
The smart car mimics the flight of the bumblebee
What would be the best method to develop technologies in order to avoid collisions, if not the imitation of the obstacles sensors existing in nature?
For example, the bumblebees.
In a surprising project presented at the CEATEC in Japan, bumblebees provided the starting point for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of collision prevention systems.
Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the nature-imitating BR23C car robotic steering system, which was given the characteristics of bumblebees, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can dodge all collisions.
During the flight each bumblebee creates its own particular oval space that actually looks a lot like our safety protective capsule - explained Kazuhhiro Doi, chief technology officer of PR and development and research.
Composite bumblebee eyes play an important role that are able to see in all directions at an angle greater than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of composite eyes, the engineers used the laser-ray length measurement system.
It identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 meters, at a 180-degree angle, calculates its distance and sends a signal to the vehicle’s microprocessor that immediately transforms into a maneuver to avoid collision.
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the robot of the vehicle mimicking the movements of the bumblebees, modifying the direction by turning the wheels to the necessary extent.
Unlike any existing system today, this maneuver is totally instinctive.
“If not, the vehicle’s robot could not react quickly enough to dodge obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Lab and the vehicle robot project.
It must react immediately and instinctively, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the safety protective capsule, in a layer within which all types of collisions are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process should reflect what a bumblebee does to dodge other bumblebees.
This process should be done in a snap.
However, unlike bumblebees, the movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonally, but can only be two-dimensional and exclusively in the direction of rotation of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for bumblebees to dodge other bumblebees, here they only used as a possibility for the robot of the car the rotary movement and acceleration in addition to braking.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and their energy density is higher, meaning they have a longer lifespan than lithium-ion.
According to Andoh, the important thing is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the capacity for data processing, let alone storage.
This apparatus in every second should only process a few input signals and react as the case may be.
It is not necessary to store this data or react with instinctive logic based on the data of the previous maneuvers, so it uses only a few tens of kilobytes of memory.
You don’t need gigabytes or megabytes.
This is the first step in developing the technology to immediately dodge obstacles, which Nissan estimates will be able to incorporate into mass-produced models in ten years’ time.
Another possibility for its application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to their destination, dodging existing obstacles in their path.
You already have a name for this dear child.
The written version of the $700 billion bailout law has been prepared, which will be implemented in several phases in order to buy bad loans from banks.
In the first phase, half the money will be spent.
According to East Coast timetables during new consultations that lasted until after midnight on Saturday, congressional leaders reached an agreement on the $700 billion financial bailout package in total, after several days of discussion.
“We have made significant progress,” said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic president of the U.S. Congress, saying the agreement was only to be formalized in a document.
The compromise on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the Minister of Finance, speaking about the outcome of the compromise said: this program will work and be efficient but other measures are needed. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the car of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets, i.e. the Sunday before 8 p.m., according to Washington time (i.e. before 2 a.m. on Monday, according to Central European time), without causing a spectacular jump in the stock markets.
On the bill called the 2008 economic stabilization emergency law, the first U.S. Congress will vote on Monday and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also welcomed the news about the deal.
"We are pleased with the progress made overnight and highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
The program is different from the original Bush administration proposal to spend all of the $700 billion to buy bad-quality credit-fund securities.
Now only half of the $700 billion can be spent, using $250 billion immediately after Congress votes, likely on Monday, from this sum the Ministry of Finance will buy securities worth of bad credit, and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the president’s decision.
This program will be controlled by a special body, in which the president of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the $700 billion can be spent after a new congressional decision.
According to the law the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: it will be able to simultaneously buy bad loans, mortgages and securities of credit fund, in addition to other credits of the "poisonous" type as well.
The purchase can be made at auctions or directly - informed competent people of the ministry.
The law allows affected companies to participate in an insurance program where the finance portfolio guarantees the troubling elements, for which companies will pay the amount corresponding to the foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson said that the law ensures the necessary financial means, which can reach up to $700 billion to meet the urgent needs of the American financial system, whether it be the purchase of bad financial means, their insurance or the prevention of risks that could cause the collapse of some major financial institutions.
We do everything necessary to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it,” he added.
Instead, the heads of banks that are in trouble and await state aid will be able to count on the official limitation of their compensations, which the American slang simply calls parachutes of gold.
Only in certain cases will payments be limited, and the limitations depend on the form of aid from the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministry buys as part of an auction, an extra tax will be imposed on gold parachutes, unless the bank’s failed boss retires.
By buying bad credits directly, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that bosses’ compensations are not overstated.
In addition to the above, existing gold parachute contracts will not be changed, the limitations refer only to new contracts to stimulate participation in the program as well.
This is the first case in American history that will be in effect a legal limitation for the revenues of the CEOs - said the measure Democrat Barney Frank, president of the committee of Congress, responsible for financial services.
The state will also have the right to acquire shares of the banks participating in the program, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, as they will ultimately even be able to make profits with the transaction as soon as the economy recovers and with it the bank.
Under the bill, over the next five years, the president will have to submit a proposal to Congress on how to return the financial sector’s losses to taxpayers.
Of course there were those on both sides who expressed reservations about the project.
This is not what American citizens have entrusted us, that is, they are not protecting taxpayer dollars," California Republican Congressman Darrell Issa said.
His fellow Ohio Democrat, Mary Kaptur, said: The measures were urged by the same ones who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Domestic sales prices in the processing industry sectors rose minimally, up 0.1 percent from July.
The largest increase in the magnitude of prices occurred in August 2008 in the leather and footwear production sector (2.8 percent), primarily due to the 4.6 percent increase in bags and belts per month and the 2.5 percent increase in footwear.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical base materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical materials production branch (1.6 percent).
There was a decrease in price in the petrochemical sector (1.4 percent), in the production of electric machines and instruments (0.9 percent), as well as - to a small extent - in the wood processing sectors (0.1 percent).

In the supply of electricity, gas, heat and water that represent a significant weight within domestic trade, an increase of 0.3 percent was recorded in August, firstly as a result of the effect of the increase in official prices from July 1.
In a comparison of a twelve-month period – in domestic sales of the sectors of the processing industry – the highest price increase was recorded in the petrochemical sector (32.4 percent).
In the metalworking sector, there was a 13.2 percent increase, while in the food, beverage and tobacco industries, there was an 11 percent increase.
There was a decrease in prices in the textile industry (2.5 percent), as well as in the manufacture of electric machines and instruments (0.3 percent).

Will you no longer need a visa to go to the United States next year?
Kinga Göncz believes there is a good chance that around January 12 the U.S.-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will come into force - the foreign minister spoke about it in Chicago, before Hungarian residents there.
In his opinion, “virtually everything depends on the timely construction on the other side of the Atlantic of the electronic access and control system.”
At the same time, he warned that in the new system the premise of entry will disappear, but tourists before their departure from the country of origin will have to register.
As of today, the head of Hungarian diplomacy is holding talks in Washington.
He will meet with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, handing her the Middle Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and hold negotiations with the international policy advisers of presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favor of the banks’ bailout package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates for the presidency of the two major U.S. parties, on Sunday pledged their support for the administration’s $700-million banking aid program, while politicians are demanding the resignation of the finance minister.
Representatives of Congress and the administration, after several days of marathon-style negotiations, on Sunday morning announced: a principled agreement was reached on the bank bailout package.
The financial package aimed at resolving the Wall Street crisis and thawing the frozen credit market became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to show that they are more capable than their rival in pulling the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, as economic issues rose to the forefront, Obama regained some advantage and disappeared the McCain advantage he had gained after the Republicans’ convention with Sarah Palin’s candidacy for the vice presidency.
At a Detroit campaign rally last Sunday, Obama expressed hope that Congress will swiftly pass the $700 billion package bill.
He stressed that the proposal includes those points of consumer protection, which he himself supported.
“We have to act now and responsibly ... employment, savings from you are in danger, as well as entire industries and the stability of the entire economy,” he told a crowd of 35,000.
He did not waste the opportunity to label McCain’s economic concepts obsolete.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: “We will all swallow this hard... but doing nothing is simply not a viable path.”
The Republican senator said that the proposal included the establishment of a commission of control to the minister of fines and the limitation of the compensations of the executives, he was the one who insisted on that.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not play any major role in the consultations, instead he consulted daily with the minister.
Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that Congressmen will likely vote on the bill by Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking area
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group itself became the most conscious voters - states the Spiegel on the weak electoral result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a red-hot coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the electronic edition of the German left-wing magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution Devours its Parents" he discusses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
The social Christians for several decades were developing Bavaria - and now it is precisely these modern citizens who are turning their backs on it.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of the whole Christian democracy, as well as of Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Sunday a process that had been foreseen for almost ten years ended: the undisputed hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU scored 47.7 percent, for the first time below 50 percent since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago, in the 2005 Bundestag elections, i.e. still during the much-mentioned Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consequent modernization of the CSU in the devouring province of its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but at the same time they were very wrong, but the secularization, the results of education and the settlement of the North Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria had their negative consequences on the fidelity of the CSU voters.
With modernization, the possibilities are also increasing, and this also has political consequences.
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group itself became the most conscious, most critical and most stubborn voters.
It is surprising that in recent weeks it was the conventional groups of citizens who moved the most away from the CSU; the self-employed, the small industrialists, the high school graduates and the graduates.
Support for the CSU was reduced to less than 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The conservative newspaper in Vienna: "Who with whom? In its article entitled "Party presidents are very reserved on coalition issues" - it deals with the confused situation of domestic politics after the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open in all directions to negotiate, while the Greens still do not want to consult on the coalition.
Elections have already been held, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the party leaders have barely seen some of their decks.
SPÖ President Werner Faymann confirmed that he wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is possible - this already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left the question pending if he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current ÖVP president, in the post of vice chancellor.
He claimed that in any case they disapproved of the Schüssel-Molterer era.
It is not possible to follow this political trend.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
He said that cooperation would certainly not be successful if Faymann tried to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
It is still open in the party whether they will elect the opposition or join the coalition, these issues must undoubtedly be discussed within the ÖVP itself.
BZÖ President Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are willing to take responsibility for the government," Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious cycle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today the European Summit for Equal Opportunities was launched in Paris, its host being France, which this year is also the President of the European Union.
Livia Járóka, Member of the European People's Party for Fidesz, in her message addressed to the plenary, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, drew attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that plague Roma children and it is also the biggest obstacle to the prevalence of their interests.
This high-level conference was inaugurated - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner responsible for Jobs, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The meeting was attended by representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European social rights organisations.
Járóka - according to the press office of the group of Fidesz deputies in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to discrimination in employment, gypsies are left out of the labor market in the first place because of their low level of education.
“Most young Roma have not finished high school and because of the poor quality of basic education, only an insignificant part can earn a university degree.”
Járóka also stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, plays a decisive role in the predominance of other human rights as well.
Investing in the education of Roma children at an early age can strengthen the economy of EU member states.
According to the MEP, these issues need to be made widely known both among Roma and non-Gypsies.
For the earlier a gypsy student starts school, the more chances he will have to become an active member of the labor market; through income and consumption taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
“Gypsies, as citizens of the European Union, must be guaranteed the right to quality education and ensure the abolition of segregated and low-level education,” said Livia Járóka.
According to the MEP, the objective and active unity of the European Union is necessary to speed up immediately the processes of school desegregation, for which it is of fundamental importance to correctly comply with the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
“We must break the vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, we must offer Roma children the possibility of guaranteeing democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens,” he said.
The aim of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, held annually since last year’s Berlin meeting in the name of the “European Year of Equal Opportunities”, is to ensure a unique forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at European and national level in the Member States.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
At the end of October, a decision will be made on the fate of the failed Huber-Beckstein duo.
Despite the serious electoral defeat, heads have not yet been cut off at the peaks of the Bavarian CSU, so far the debate on personal issues has been postponed.
Erwin Huber, president of the party and Günther Beckstein, provincial prime minister still remain in their posts, but it is not known how long the grace will last.
The duo’s fate, which suffered a catastrophic 17 percent electoral defeat, will be decided at the party’s extraordinary congress to be held last weekend in October.
The members of the much criticized duo hinted: they do not hold on to their posts so much.
This meant reassuring the furious members of his parliamentary group and grassroots organization, who one day after the Bavarian tsunami demanded personal consequences due to the loss of an absolute majority.
Five years ago – although under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber who was at the top of his career – the Christian social union reached 60.7 percent, instead now, a year after the coup d’état against Stoiber, they achieved only 43.4 percent.
The CSU for 46 years had "monopoly" in Bavaria that gives 18 percent of German GDP.
Although in the southern province, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, conservatives continue to predominate, in the future they will no doubt have to make a coalition with someone.
As a first sign of the party’s restructuring, Vice President Horst Seehofer, Federal Minister of Agriculture, one of Huber’s possible successors, also holds a position in the small intelligence group that starts negotiations with the liberal FDP and the right-wing Free Voters on a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about fate is that in the list of Free Electors enters the parliament that Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was exploited for the coup of the Huber-Beckstein duo and then cruelly erased from the stage the ambitious local politics.
The top leaders of the CSU are now investing all their energies to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition he will also play an active role in Stoiber, who has so far been moving the ropes in the background, the former provincial head of government and former president of the CSU called September 28 the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday Huber made some critical remarks to the CDU, in his opinion they would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and to Angela Merkel herself as well.
After the September 2009 Bundestag elections, Merkel will not be able to be chancellor if they are not able to highlight together the CSU that played a significant role in the successes of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel, who could hardly hide her disappointment at the failure, the CSU’s losses will not have a negative impact on the Berlin grand coalition.
Which is of course relative: it will not be easier to treat the injured CSU and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent achieved its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Lukashenko's opposition: 110-0
After Sunday’s election, there will be no opposition MP in the Belarusian parliament.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability that Alexandr Lukashenko guarantees in the country, instead according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained rather by the violations of the law committed during the counting of the votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election result.
Although the legislature of the country of 10 million inhabitants, made up of percent and ten deputies, more than a decade ago has no opposition, before yesterday's elections the united opposition under the name of United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) expected that Lukashenko, who for the fourth time renewed his mandate after the 2006 elections of dubious legitimacy, as a result of the amendment of the Constitution dipermiti this time.
So the ODSZ suppressed the boycott it originally wanted to do.
At the bottom of the expectations of the opposition was that Belarus, which increasingly depends more economically on Russia - which took a credit to moderate the import of increasingly expensive natural gas from Russia and which contributed to the sale to Russia of Beltransgaz, owner of the gas pipeline that passes through the country - wanted to improve its relations with the European Union, which does not give Lukashenko high-level politicians a political antiochenko.
It was a sign of easing when the OSCE, in assessing the election campaign, placed emphasis on positive phenomena rather than mistakes – such as the ban on participation imposed on a third of opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE's primary report on Monday criticized even the campaign itself - in which opposition candidates could not appear in the press - and especially that the opposition could not be present in the vote count.
With all this in the opinion of the opposition there is an improvement in the political climate: the political prisoners have been released and Minsk is ready for a small confrontation with Moscow, denying recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a federal state - has been considering the two regions as independent for a month now.
"We have taken two steps forward and one step backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has begun," Milinkevich told the newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate of the presidential elections of 2006 it is desirable to maintain this situation, even though "the regime fears allowing even one opponent to enter that weightless parliament".
The opposition does not plan to organize protests as it sees the results, but rather tries to get its message to the voters about the need for economic reforms.
- This clearly causes us a lot of problems because we must print the opposition press in Russia, the local authorities put difficulties before their distribution, but even so I see that more and more are supporting the change among the elderly as well - said Milinkevich, alluding to that to the Lukashenko regime, which believes that its main result is the creation of social security, do not consider it suitable even the pensioners who are more officially subsidized.
Due to the country’s indebtedness and rising trade deficit, it is only a matter of time for the breakdown of social security that “looks like the silence of the cemeteries,” Milinkevich said.
Russian observers, unlike the opposition politician, called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told Russian news agency Ria Novosti: “people do not believe in words but in deeds,” so the lack of opposition is nothing more than testimony to the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on you get more breakfast before you start working"
It has never happened in the history of Chigi Palace that they put automatic doors to control the entry and exit of the staff.
But from today he starts with this measure against who signs and then goes to the bar to have a coffee during working hours.
This news has been presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"Automatic doors - says Brunetta - are an instrument to work better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services," says the minister.
“A new season of accountability and transparency is now opening up.
This is Reformism,” Brunetta stresses again.
With Chigi Palace the installation is completed in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi “the choice of automatic doors is also important from a symbolic point of view”.
No resistance has been found from employees, the secretary general says: "It has been a change shared by the workers and there was collaboration from them."
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee and half-moons.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7 a.m. is a holy hand."
During a convention at the Higher School of Public Administration
In Rome, the minister states that "in three months the absences from illness of public employees have been reduced by 50%, that is 60,000 more people to work in a year."
He added that public administration needs to be made more effective.
In Italy, which wage dynamics over the past 8-10 years have been doubling over the private sector and well above the inflation rate.
For now millions of public employees have joined together to oppose the rules of the Brunetta decree adhering to the petition supported by the Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service shows the numbers, the lowest absenteeism of work due to disease causes - writes the association of consumers - the people of 'vague workers' is constantly increasing.
In Italy, millions are effectively the right and productive employees of the public administration who have come together to declare war on the illegitimate rules of the decree.
In particular, the TAR will answer the exclusion of economic treatments added due to illness due to service; the extension of the time slots in which medical check-ups of the sick employee are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions wanted by the minister.
Work accidents, Napolitano: "Critical prevention"
Every day in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 are permanently disabled.
For 2007, the Inail data effectively confirm that white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures that testify to the severity of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th national day for the victims of workplace accidents, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data disseminated by the Anmil and the same tragic news these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," said the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the president of the Anmil, National Association mutilated and invalidated by work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "great appreciation for the constant associative efforts in favour of prevention in the workplace, protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of the victims and raising public awareness".
"It has manifested itself, a 'enough', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, due to their dimensions, provoke the clamor of the media and the participation of public opinion, on the other hand the daily reality proposes dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly a problem of resources: it is decisive to invest in training and information.
Particular significance is given to the numerous initiatives promoted in the school environment for a more direct awareness on the part of young people entering the world of work.
It is a duty to keep alive the attention to the phenomenon, not to curb the alarm about social gravity, to apply and improve the legislative norms.
For his part, the president of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini has emphasized "how the phenomenon of white deaths constitute an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all institutions a determined effort to urgently put an end".
“The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not mean that the number of white deaths is equally impressive,” said Anmil President Pietro Mercandelli.
We do not want this “decrease trend” to translate into less attention, because it is precisely when attention decreases that tragedy explodes.
“We believe that at the general level too little is done to counteract the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
They are necessary, at our discretion - it has emphasized Mercandelli - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the world of the school ".
"A further effort is needed - it has added - because it concerns the communication and the sensitization of public opinion.
But above all, there is a need for a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers regarding a phenomenon that represents a social emergency.”
Mercandelli denounced "the progressive deterioration of the level of subsidiary guardianship envisaged for the victims of work" and the "assistance diversion towards which the system is heading in recent years".
“The goal is to give back to the worker the guarantee of insurance because the fate of the person who is injured does not have to depend on the gift provided by the legislator each time.”
MP3 Players Charged With Hearing Risk
Listening to loud music over a long period of time using portable music devices such as MP3 players can cause permanent hearing injuries.
This is what the European Commission says, which in a statement released in Bruxel cites the opinion of the Scientific Commission on the emerging and recently identified health risk (Csrseri) of the EU, published today.
“From this scientific opinion, it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable music devices weekly for more than an hour a day having the device at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing ability.”
“I am concerned that such a high number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and high-acoustic cell phones can unconsciously ruin their ears in an irreparable way,” Kuneva said.
“From the scientific evidence a clear risk emerges and we must react quickly.
What counts is raising awareness among consumers and making this information public.
We must also re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion, so that they are broadly effective and have the pace with the new technology."
Bruxel had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the large use of portable music devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise that that causes.
“Scientists confirm that this is a cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine together with Member States and stakeholders what steps could eventually be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable music and related devices.”
Currently, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100 dB, but concern is increasing as the hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
It is possible to limit these damages very much by resorting to solutions such as reducing levels and the time of exposure to noise.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee notes that users of portable music devices listen to high volume (more than 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours a week exceed the limit currently in force relative to the maximum noise allowed in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing after a period of 5 years.
It means that it affects 5-10% of users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Germany paves the way for the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it starts, in March it closes, in June the accounts will be made.
This is the schedule set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the future of the capital of Rome", which has been established this morning in its new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will discuss the main points for Rome.
After closing the doors in March, the board and the municipal council will evaluate analyses and projects, in order to present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Municipality and its intendant Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas - it tends to underline Alemanno - It will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the board and the municipal council, can then endorse.
There is no superb position of roles, only the will to have a place where to elaborate a great project for Rome.
In March finished the works will disappear, because this experience must have a precise temporary end.
In June, we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome.
To those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since their opinions are not binding, Alemanno replies: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to carry out and the quality of its proposals.
If quality is present, as well as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am also sure in Rome, its contribution will be crucial.
Almost always politics is crushed in ordinary management and in emergencies that turn around.
We, on the contrary, want to look beyond and in the long term, in a deeper perspective, working seriously for the development of Rome and its future.
“This Commission is neither a useless entity nor a triviality: it is absolutely free, it will not cost Roman citizens a euro and will serve to involve and reason the best minds expressed by the capital.”
For Alemanno, indeed, "it is necessary to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or immobile, to allow our city to make a real leap of level, of which we have absolute need, thinking in a unified spirit to its future."
A future that, says the intendant of Rome, "would not be limited to the current communal boundaries but would look beyond" not only from the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal state of Capital but "also considering the role that Rome can and should play as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president.
A well-known American politician who is interested in calling himself independent has written: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the U.S. economy and formed relationships (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Attacks on Obama are on the rise as the election date approaches.
A Miami woman wrote on a website: “This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big stone face: he believes he will win the highest office in the nation that has had two governors and five black senators!
In reality, these are attacks that don’t say much; they are attacks that are clearly racial in nature and don’t answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? And there are also the polls; everyone says that Obama won and with a good advantage.
Also in this case there are those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the bowels of the southern United States, has written an editorial: once in the cockpit to vote we will know well who the American patriot will vote for.
One side of the American mindset is covered up to the last.
“Whatever you say, we’ll think about where to put the cross, whether it’s about Obama or McCain.”
There are people who swear that if Obama wins, we will leave America.
Things never said before, the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
Yet despite all these arguments, the winning weapon for Democrats is George Bush.
They have asked 1,500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his tenure? 89 percent have replied: Iraq.
It changes America.
In Vietnam, the nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was kicked home in the ass.
In Iraq there are 4,500 soldiers who have lost their lives and Americans have not been forced to pack their bags.
Similarly, Iraq for most has been Bush’s weak point.
Whoever assumes the post of George W will have a huge duty to develop.
In the United States, the economic collapse is also felt for journalists: in the newspapers it is time for cuts. Many blame the Internet, "murder" of the printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been asked by PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mind control for the future.
Today, however, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, journalists have not openly stated that they are less concerned about credibility.
They don’t feel as isolated as they once did.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model.
In addition to the cuts made in the room where the editors work to make the newspaper, it is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if you do not want traditional journalism as most of the public understands it to be substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pessimism now prevails over the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that national journalism is on the wrong track.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against emission.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses open a gap on the Internet, for many seen as the "murderer" of the printed letter.
The “economic pressure” journalists warn has risen to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that it will “do something good” for journalism.
The biggest rupture in American journalism today is between who runs the newspapers – that is, the directors – and the journalists who work for them.
56% of national executives are confident that their journalists share the same values, while locally the percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this has to do with “work safety.”
Executives who plan to lose their jobs in 3 years are 47% nationwide.
For the journalistic staff it is 30%.
The issue of “safe work” at the staff level (our editors, ed.) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In a nation as vast as the United States, with 300 million people and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want and it becomes a matter of “take it or leave it.”
Directors almost always get good salaries, while editors can earn up to $10,000 a month, plus retirement and social insurance.
For the holidays, reasoning becomes complicated: a total of days in the first year, another after the third to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by his admission, become "sick" followed throughout the year.
It's all a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: ROMA COURT, DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the instance of real estate agent Danilo Coppola who had asked to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is under investigation for bankruptcy in the field of investigation into the counter pact related to the Unipol-Bnl escalation.
In the course of the process of arrest at his expense, last week, he has obtained home release, transforming it into mandatory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate agent could travel the route of the city of the province to a room in the capital.
According to the court, these trips (for which the PM has voted against) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence accusing him.
Elites in Danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 million rescue plan launched by the White House: a significant portion of Americans were, and this one, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
Yesterday’s New York Times confirmed that the ongoing crisis is disarming the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old soul on the East Coast, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to “those in Washington” and the world of finance, especially strong in the Central and Southern states.
The soul, in fact, has become overpowering with the vote of whoever spoke at the beginning.
This is just one example of the mutations, of the great mutations, that the ongoing economic earthquake heralds: not only in the United States but in all the West and not only here.
Both in the United States and in Europe for a long time the crisis seems to function as an accelerator of incubation phenomena that with the new climate solidify and come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-upgrading, the extraordinary reactivation, of the double category state-sovereignty in relation to a type of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, indeed, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions which have, yes, strong financial relations with the outside world, but above all the balance sheets of families living in a single country and a single state are much more compromised.
He who immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who, on the other hand, are voters.
The crisis appears economically global but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of the question or they don’t have much to say: the crucial test is the European Union which, as always, divides between the different interests and the different state strategies cannot decide any common policy.
It is the government of each state that everyone expects intervention, rescue and reactivation plans, new rules and above all the granting of funds: from the moment the court is reached it is only the state that possesses the economic resources and the mass of financial resources to remedy things.
And they also possess the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of incalculable value, values in certain circumstances in which no market is likely and no organization can ever dispose of them to the same extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis places on the nation-state is in perfect harmony, with the greatest importance provided that the new development of the economy tends to attribute to a factor closely linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the network of ever more sophisticated technology, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future will instead have to do more and more with the immaterial things like water, crops and oil.
All things that, you see, can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth but are equally united in an absolute way in a circumscribed space, a territory.
So whoever finds himself sovereign certainly has many more letters about who he is not, and who has the misfortune of living in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I arrive at the second novelty that foreshadows a fracture.
Whoever says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics and Leadership.
In this sense the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand the objective awareness of the need for leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take charge of the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for the existing leaderships, of unsuitable economic species with many dark areas.
And together something deeper and in a certain sense disturbing: a discredit, an intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of Western countries in a growing number.
More and more, in various places of the population, seems to advance the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the social elites that have hitherto been booming, the same way of feeling and being, their culture in the understanding exception of the term, to have made time itself and to be more foreign to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in a nutshell, feeds underground a somewhat branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which manifest themselves in an electoral "revolt" or in the sudden changes of collective moods of recent times, from the conservative exit in Austria-Bavaria to the collapse of the social-democratic consensus that the Americans also see in the rebellion against the right-wing in Britain.
It seems that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, I would say some, make it ever more difficult to understand and then to represent, that which from today is taking shape are the deep strata of Western society and that the economic crisis renews, increases and potentially agitates in excess.
In the face of all this talking about a “mass rebellion” today is frankly exaggerated.
But having your eyes open is certainly not.
The super glue to walk on the walls
Overcome the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on walls like the spider man.
It is the target of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has come close enough.
With an adhesive of only 2.5 square centimetres, scientists have been able to have a body of 100 kilograms glued on a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of existing ones using a particular structure of carbon, called carbon nanotubes.
“The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered like a spaghetti pile,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of the geckos, coated with microscopic hairs that can ensure the animal a perfect adhesion.
Tests done on different materials, such as glass, teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the reptile’s legs and at the same time “is easily peeled off the walls,” explains Liming Dai, a research fellow at the University of Dayton’s Faculty of Engineering.
"This material could be useful as a transient adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Layers to walk through walls exactly like spider man? Layers do, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductive of heat and electric current.
Other applications may have to do with aerospace engineering.
No superheroes at the moment.
OTHER RESEARCH – The University of California, Berkeley, is also working on finding a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, Californian scholars have presented an adhesive made of microfibers like hair that self-clean from dust during movement on a surface to always maintain perfect adhesion.
Drugs: never with fruit juice
Attention to grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if taken simultaneously with some drugs its absorption is altered by amplifying or decreasing, depending on the case, efficiency with serious consequences for health.
To repeat the risk of fruit juices being packaged and fresh associated with the intake of some medicines David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who since the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in progress to Philadelphia sends a new alarm: just a glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice to reduce the absorption of some drugs and nullify the health of patients.
Grapefruit juice had already been charged because it was held responsible for increasing to toxic levels some anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine and neurological medicines.
The same Italian drug agency had given the news in a newsletter two years ago alarming doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger that came from this mixture and to pay attention to what you drink in case you are taking a drug such as Diasepam or Metadone.
NOT ONLY POPULATION – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology at the State University of Milan, said: “These findings are generally pointed out to the various international and national drug agencies that eventually provide to change the information notes of the same.
That is why we must always read the illustrative brochures of the medicines that are assumed and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not let ourselves be impressed, ask clearly the doctor or the pharmacist "stressed the expert of the agency Ansa.
The Economics novel by Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics has been awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies, his business models and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known New York Times columnist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy decisions.
A few months after the September 11, 2001, attack on Enron, Krugman had predicted in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in consequence for the United States.
A forecast that triggers a lot of controversy and that for several years came blamed to the economy, but that has now turned out to be accurate.
“I’m surprised and a little upset at how the memory of the Enron and Worldcom collapse scandal has quickly disappeared from public attention,” Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European central bank, Krugman is a “high-value economist” but also a “very aggressive publicist, particularly critical of the excesses of the liberalism of the Bush administration.”
Open Office, echo the third edition of the package"anti-Microsoft»
It is the launch day of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to attract more and more users, from home to the office to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office.
After nearly a year of work by volunteer developers, whose backs are guarded by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several novelties: to the welcome screen and less coarse revised interface, more consistent ones are added, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF(Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard.
Attention also paid to multi-function with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Some specific functions of some modules are interesting, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it via e-mail, or the possibility of importing the PDF file in the graphical processing module, while retaining the original appearance of the page.
Always on this front you can create "hybrid PDF" documents, which accumulate the typical graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text editor.
Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet they can intervene in different users, avoiding the conflicts of changes, in the drafting of texts, each contributor is given a color in the comment for better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the Web (on the cloud, over the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should give the ultimate result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and added to the English that was in the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can also be sent home or to work.
And if the topic of the free can be a hook for dissemination in the houses, it is in the business field that Open Office the suite tests, tries the big bet, already having several projects carried out in the public administration and in schools.
And there is not even a lack of realities that offer an ideal training, consultation and assistance service for small and medium-sized companies, in which business prospects could be opened.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the corresponding video writing of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for the presentation of Powerpoint; Dbase, comme in the case of the well-known Access is the program that allows to work on the database; and finally Draw the graphical module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that to date we have reached almost 3.60 million, with the release of the new version it is likely that you can exceed the predicted figure.
Kohl is also the fourth doping case.
New positive case on the Tour de France: Austrian Bernhard Kohl from the Gerolsteiner team, third-placed and winner of the best climber’s rider.
To give the news is the site of the newspaper L'Equipe.
Kohl, 26, is the fourth positive Epo racer of the third generation, after Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The tests of Kohl’s blood champions are among those carried out in recent weeks in the lab of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-evidence confirms that he is positive, the Austrian will lose third place in the Tour and wrath against the two years of canonical disqualification.
Confirming the news of Kohl’s positive doping of the third generation EPO is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press that he had notified the news to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian has positioned himself on the podium behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, winning the prize for the best climber.
IMMIGRANTS:NEW YORK TIMES IS ASKED, IS ITALY RACIST?
Italy’s emigrant country has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants” welcomed with hostility.
This is what the New York Times asks in a long article dedicated to the debate on the subject of racism in Italy, starting with the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso who was murdered the previous month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case evidences what the New York Times calls the “northern paradox”: the northern regions are at the same time those where there is “more integration and more work” but also the highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the highest support in the northern league.
As confirmed by the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also cited episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not alone.
Also the new legislation wanted by the Lega tightens the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
Pope Francis said: “Giorgio Napolitano, meeting Benedict XVI in Congress, has asked that the State and the Church work together to combat racism.”
Students victims of expensive rent, up to 900 euros for a room
The rental market for college students does not know the crisis.
According to the latest Sunia poll, renting a single room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"the phenomenon has already assumed very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study a large part of young people for the very high costs that the family would have to sustain - explains the head of the office of studies of the Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand has totally distorted the market to the point of triggering a process of widespread increase even for the residents."
Apart from the fact that in most cases the rental offers contain a series of violations: free, unregistered, no fee limit, sub linked rentals.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions are necessary that, through the revision of the tax, prices can be regulated.
Looking in detail at the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brianza area, they serve approximately 450 euros; for a single room from a minimum of 650 (Bande Nere area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate area, Udine and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 (Victoria area).
In Florence a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room approximately 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in the areas near the University, they serve 250/280 euros for a bed in a double room and 370 to 500 euros for a single one.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Bologna Square) they ask you about 600 euros for a single room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros for a single room) in areas near other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You can save money only if you change peripheral area: 300 euros for a bed and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and surrounding area.
In Naples for a bed you serve 300/450 euros, for a room you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for one bed you serve 250/350 euros, at least 350 for one single.
in the smaller cities the prices are lower in absolute terms, but it has a greater weight in the economy of the city.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of student and non-EU rents is more frequent, there is a further anomaly: a 25/30% increase in the fee for foreign students compared to Italians.
Farewell to the old Paradiso cinema, cities cancel historic halls
The historic cinemas close favoring the Multiplex.
“A city without movie theaters in a blind city is like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in the major Italian urban centers and also in the provincial cities.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, which with the birth of the great meticones in the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the mono rooms in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
To disappear are almost always historical places, full of memory, "it is as if a friend died, an acquaintance with whom a piece of place was shared and so much emotion", Notes the director of the new cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago won the cousin Oscar and the grand prize of the jury in Cannes, which counted the poetry of a provincial cinema room and the nostalgia for the lost way of life.
The figures given by the Anec, the main association of merchants, make it clear: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and most are paid for: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most suffered by the closures are as first, Emilia-Romagna with 82 less cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that the cause of its disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, it is these three Italian regions that have recorded the largest number of new Meticon cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romagna.
“The Italian exercise has developed irrationally,” observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, “it would be useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to guarantee the permanence of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its visitors are willing to transfer to meticones.
Not to mention the lack of funds in favor of traders: the previous debt of the state is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful from an ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
To sustain the sector would need between 16 and 18 million euros a year.”
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that worried about the closures, decided to repair itself with the signing of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to promote and protect the cinema mono sala both in the historic center and in the periphery.
Among the proposed rules there are fiscal facilitation mediations in favour of managers and advantages for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic zone and will have special rates for parking.
“It’s an initiative that I like,” observes Giuseppe Tornatore, “and I hope other cities will follow Bologna’s example by setting up other measures.
It is true, that to contrast the extra power of meticones, traditional rooms have to improve the quality of sound and image because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that was always important to me: the closure of Bagheria cinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make the "New Cinema Paradiso", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the already closed Rialto or the Quirinale of Via Nazionale, where I have lived so many emotions shared, so as not to see the posters blackened by the dust, I turn to the other side.
Link between politics and 'ndrangheta, the mayor of Gioia Tauro has been arrested
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to standardize the elections of the Municipality for those interested in the Piromalli cosca."
The accusations that the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria give to the intendant and the deputy intendant of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the intendant of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for mafia association, are heavy.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the elderly mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson, the eponymous boss, already convicted of criminal gang association and to compensate 10 million euros, were also arrested.
“Disregarding any legal and moral norms, and common sense,” the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed a willingness to pay for consultations with lawyer Piromalli.
“It would have been allowed to the mafia family – the judges write – to officially enter inside the municipality facilitating the great possibility of control and command of the public administration.”
The president of the Calabrian regional junta Agazio Loiero does not hide that "agreements between organized bad life there is a lot" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'ndrangheta, heroes who stay clean."
This morning’s arrests are added to those of last July after police had announced the cutting of the heads of the Piromalli mafia family.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had dissolved, already in 1991 and always due to alleged conditioning between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been entrusted with the task of managing the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the UDC’s incumbent at the time of the dissolution, after the ballot in May 2006, had been elected as head of a center-right coalition.
I explode a scandal when the prefecture orders the dissolution of the city council.
I call into question the deputy interior minister who at the time was Marco Minniti, accusing him of having organized everything for a political issue, but the judges in the arrest warrant signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even asked for the variation of the A3 road project.
From the environmental interceptions made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, it emerges "the willingness to favor the demands of a businessman, representative of a group very close to the Piromalli clan, uniforming the public administration's choices on the interests of the mafia families".
When the energy is born from the waves, the big ones come down to the stage.
It is an exterminated deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet’s surface and is now being discovered by the world’s major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which the big ones look like Chevron.
The possibility of harvesting energy from sea movements has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s along with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil dropped in 1980, the idea of harnessing marine energy was pushed aside, but now that environmental cases and the new rise in oil are giving the sector momentum.
London’s World Energy Council (WEC) has estimated that 15 percent of the world’s electricity needs could be met by implants that exploit the movement of sea waves.
This would be twice the amount currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And there would be tides and tides.
Giants on attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy has been Enersis, which in 2005 has signed an agreement to build an implant in the North of Portugal.
When the intention was announced, it seemed like a revolutionary step.
Two years away to bet on marine energy are always more and among these companies that have always voted for traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying ocean energy technology,” a spokeswoman for a ha-associate company told the Wall Street Journal, “and is considering cooperating with us.”
The cooperation in question is about obtaining a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
This is a pretty important sign, considering that in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has activated a plan to make new drilling.
In addition to Chevron is Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey to follow the path of energy coming from the sea, the total invested so far, although not detailed, indicate an increasing interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts talk about a technology still in the beginning, because there is no doubt that marine energy has a great environmental impact.
For now the impacts like those Portuguese or the Scots are small and do not seem to create big problems for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, a technology with greater environmental impact must be used.
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a boas system linked together.
The force of the waves, which causes the boas to move up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside them.
The pressure rotates a turbine which in turn powers a generator.
Electricity is sent to the coast via submarine cables.
For now there are four implants of this type under development, waiting only for federal approval, apart from energy, could serve for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces power for a mall and a parking lot, using underwater turbines in New York’s East River.
The movement of the water when there are tides, spins the turbine blades, creating a rotating movement that feeds the generator.
Verdant has said he has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to use the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say at the Institute for the Development of Electricity, deserves at this time the potential of the tides.
While it is an intermittent phenomenon, tides are more preventable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is mostly about the energy of the tides that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others that are approaching the coast, have invested $7.5 million in 2008 and are expected to invest $35 million by 2009.
