Tom won't win.
Tom thinks you're stupid.
Stop screaming.
He doesn't carry anything done.
Do you have any bigger bowls?
My book seemed interesting.
I don't know the answer.
I love to visit.
I don't want to go with you.
I'll be back in three weeks.
He eats nothing but fruit.
What do you mean, "ata"?
Is Tom okay?
I think I've lost my key.
Who sent you?
Stop that woman.
Did you wear it all over?
Pakistan is a Muslim country.
Do you understand French?
I'll be back late.
Tom says he will resign.
Eat it!
Tom's down.
The kids love to do this.
I'm sorry for him.
Have you ever done that?
What's the point of it doing?
What's today's date?
Goodbye.
He was angry.
I agree.
My father likes pizza.
Do you understand what he's saying?
I wrote a letter.
I like apples.
Didn't you buy it yesterday?
Eat that shit!
It's not true what you said.
They have two girls.
Any leave for the kids?
Come here!
Everyone rejected Tom.
I live in one small village.
Keep an eye on Tom.
What's the price?
Don't look!
We agree.
Tom went out.
Greetings, how are you?
Tom's really good at that.
I don't want you.
Do you have my book?
I'll be back later.
Tom picked it up.
Don't open it.
Come in.
Tom teaches me French.
Mind if I sit next to you?
Then it's difficult.
My neighbor is Tom Jackson.
I don't know exactly what to say.
Yesterday was my birthday.
Where else are Tom going?
I need a bag locker.
You must eat this cough.
Who can you take a day off?
I want to change my ticket.
Tom's probably not happy.
Eat whatever you like.
They're all screaming.
It's too late.
Let us down.
I couldn't find the cure.
I had a cat.
Don't wait.
What time is it open?
It's ours.
Why don't you try to take your money back?
Can I see your passport?
I can't find a word.
How can you be so quiet?
Get what you want.
Rome in Italy.
Tom's tired.
I can take care of it.
When will you come back?
Can you speak French?
I don't want you to leave this alone.
The roof of the Earth, indeed.
I was just sitting there.
Come back.
Tom tried to raise his mouth.
Tom's dead.
Tom cried like a child.
Let him go.
I don't recognize anyone else from a twin.
I'm reading your book.
Nothing's gone.
He was talking.
May I?
Longer than Tom Mary.
The kid's screaming.
I'm getting up all my time.
Ten, twenty, forty, fifty, sixty, 80, 90, one hundred.
He spent his time reading books.
I won.
Take my fucking handkerchief.
I won't tolerate it.
Good night!
They were all screaming.
There are many branches of science.
No, not me, you!
Watch your bicycles and pedestrians!
You always complain.
For what?
I want to open an account.
You're gonna have to take a ticket when you're on the bus.
It's not hard to learn French.
I'm cold.
I bought a pound of meat another day.
Watch your mouth!
Is everything all right?
Lincoln died in 1865.
We failed.
What's my room number?
He's not here yet.
Find Tom.
I don't want to go with you.
Hurry up, Tom.
The church bell is ringing.
Allow me to go.
I accept his invitation.
They have two twin girls.
Do you have a car?
You're very brave.
Don't let me down.
Do you have a bike?
Now the most important thing to do is stay calm.
Where is the purchase shop?
Look at Tom.
How long will you stay?
I walk to school.
My throat is a bit dry.
I have a new red car.
You call me.
Keep an eye on Tom.
"Why don't you go?" "Why don't I want to go?"
You're not the first person to tell me that.
He's eating.
Tom swims well.
It doesn't work?
He doesn't want to talk about it.
I've learned a lot from you.
Give me deck.
Do you have a car?
Do you eat meat?
Is there another way to go?
Nobody does that here.
You're not paying attention.
Can you show Tom around?
Take it.
Please confess my sincere apology.
Do you have anything to know?
I don't understand you.
He eats nothing but fruit.
I accepted her invitation.
Is Tom okay?
You're doctors.
Tom wanted to talk to you.
What are you doing?
Only one language is not enough.
Don't move!
They were screaming.
My father always gets angry.
Tom just wants to catch the fish.
He's close.
I like him.
That was important.
Tom closed his eyes.
Where's your stuff?
Tom Patilbu was cooped up.
How many people in your party are there?
You should sleep.
I want Tom to be here.
He'll be ten years in the next April.
Tom went screaming.
He knows where we live.
What are you doing?
He's a doctor.
Eat whatever you want.
I worked three years as a waiter.
Tom was there.
You run.
Kiss Tom.
We can't sleep for the sound.
He can talk to French.
I got your letter.
I agree.
I see.
Tom's not happy about it.
I like him.
You're rich.
I don't want to go to sleep.
My mother likes music.
Is this the way to the station?
Do you have a bike?
You always complain.
Do you eat meat?
My balls are hurting.
Can you keep an eye on Tom?
Can you play the piano?
Look at Tom.
Today I got a call from Tom.
I'm a little drunk to listen to music.
I want to buy those pineapples.
What's your name?
Don't yell!
The river went to the Pacific Ocean.
Why are you screaming?
I love writing in French.
Tom needs a friend.
It's good to see you again.
How do you expect me to take this job alone?
I saw him running.
I don't want to eat now.
Get yourself together.
I know Tom was your friend.
Stop wearing it.
How many rucks have you seen in one back?
How am I supposed to go to the airport?
I need a doctor!
Tom's screaming.
Tom, I'm a little busy here.
He's having lunch now.
I found her home easily.
I promise.
That's mine.
We'll win.
You can eat whatever you want.
I can't find my stuff.
When does the Boston train leave?
How deep?
I ran out.
I don't care what he does.
Here's your bag.
I didn't forget.
We write our own songs.
Are you okay?
I'll do my best not to disturb you in your studies.
Trust me.
I'm sorry I'm late.
He can say whatever he wants.
Were you there?
I know your name.
Got tickets for music?
Tom was talking.
I'm your friend, right?
How long does it take to get a taxi from here to go to the train station?
Tom's gonna scream.
Tom wanted to talk to you.
I'll take you back in twenty minutes.
What do you want to grow up?
I accept his invitation.
What does that mean?
I saw Tom last night.
You don't understand.
They were all screaming.
Can you please talk a little more slowly?
What kind of teeth is they doing?
The woman eats a sedooty.
Tom wanted you to get it off.
I finished my job.
My father can fly a plane.
Who doesn't want to win?
He eats fruit.
Attack!
Tom shouted loud.
Tom said Mary had given him permission to leave immediately.
Is this book Tom?
How tall you are!
It's noon.
Don't leave me alone.
Where can I buy stamps?
I heard screams.
Will you come down?
I'm lazy.
He lied about his age to get into Tom Club.
You can stay as long as you want.
He sleeps like a child.
I didn't notice.
You eat meat?
I want to cut the beard.
Don't stop here.
Excuse me, but it's not possible.
I want your opinion.
Remember who your friend is.
The item is easily expanded.
Can you tell me one more time what you said?
I totally agree.
You go first.
Take us to the hospital.
I'm not your friend.
He ran.
I lost your phone number.
Get out of here!
Are you going to catch fish with us?
How old was he?
Tom's getting me French.
This one looked cheap.
More water.
I love to travel.
I shouldn't have logged out.
Why?
Tom's breathing fast.
I know we still love each other.
Excuse me. I kept you waiting.
What Have You Found?
Sit here.
The hospital is so crowded.
He's asking how it's possible.
I asked them to send another ticket.
I can't believe it!
Tom will talk.
He explained the meaning of the phrase.
Here's your mouth.
Read this first.
What's your dad's age?
I saw that my mother was busy doing some clothes.
How much did you eat?
I'm not your friend.
I'm not screaming.
What does that word mean?
Wait outside.
Can you take me to the Grand Hotel?
I don't deny it.
The riddle's funny.
These guys need friends.
Why don't you try to take your money back?
Tom was scared of Mary.
If he agreed to his doctor's advice, he might still be alive.
What is the purpose of your visit?
Can read Tom French.
Ask Tom.
Don't yell!
Which is next stop?
Why don't you come with us?
My throat hurts when I drink.
I'm dancing.
We eat often.
He's a doctor.
Is he American?
I'm very tired.
Tom died three days later.
Tom slept on the train.
I'm lost.
He talks to French.
How much bus fare?
The meeting's location and date have been fixed.
Call my self.
The government's slowing down taxes.
Tom's staying with us.
What's your full name?
Tom played the ringer.
The rule is the rule.
I'm glad I'm gonna help you.
Do you understand?
I don't know if I have time.
How much to get inside?
We need all the words.
I saw them.
He eats too much.
I'm an anthropologist.
Tom lives there.
How can you be so quiet?
Freak, Thailand's capital.
Look down.
How old is the universe?
Someone came.
Let's get started.
He tries.
You're probably wondering how I got to know.
Don't stop.
Everyone saw it.
We're here too.
My name is Emily.
Where can I buy the book?
Do you know what he said?
What a shame.
I'm playing now.
Call the hospital.
I can't find my stuff.
Let me talk.
The door's open.
We're here.
Ask Alx.
My father is going to China.
I didn't.
Tom lies.
Don't make us think less.
I'll be back before midnight.
Come with me.
Get away.
Mary is very shy girl.
Where's the hospital near?
Where's the carpenter?
That was a cunt rabbit.
I like black.
I'm depending on you.
Do you have any tears?
I'm just kidding.
They were screaming.
This man asks how it's possible.
I forgot to call him today.
I saw him wash the car.
Tom's gonna get rid of me.
He's younger than me.
How long have you been in Boston?
How am I supposed to get to the station?
Tom thought it would save him from witches.
It's easier to write about death than to write about life.
I heard you screaming.
He doesn't want to talk about it.
Don't leave me alone.
Please eat something.
He hasn't come yet.
My father's home.
There's a cat in the kitchen!
I'm a student.
My father's open.
I think you both know Tom.
How many nights will you stay?
I didn't say anything.
You should ask him for advice.
I'm not a doctor.
Everyone was screaming.
Who cares?
Hurry up, Tom.
We traveled to South America.
What is your favorite television program?
They've got guns.
I've got my stuff in Dikye.
You're really no use.
What do you want?
He can say whatever he wants.
What time is it off?
Nobody's in there.
You need a friend.
My neck hurts.
Shut up.
Contact Tom.
I want you to talk to Tom.
I respect elders.
Spanish is her mother tongue.
They don't care.
When was the launch of Alu in Japan?
Tom never was so happy.
It's not music.
They need friends.
I heard you screaming.
He doesn't eat anything but fruit.
He doesn't eat anything except fruit.
Be careful!
No man can do this.
I'm all right.
Which hat is yours?
He can say whatever he wants.
I only have one blanket.
Don't talk to Tom that way.
He was giving a speech.
What languages are spoken in the United States?
I read English.
Let us in.
He was giving a speech.
He hasn't come yet.
Is that your book?
I went out.
Tom Boston has grown up.
I don't have to do anything.
Do you want another one?
It's already seven o'clock.
I haven't done it for years.
How much do you want to take?
Democracy inspires freedom.
I like tea.
How much does it cost?
I can kill you.
Tom screamed.
I don't think it will rain tomorrow.
I can only speak French.
I don't want you to go.
My dad's busy.
It's already seven o'clock.
I was in Rome.
Hurry up.
I can put my knee on the ground without bleeding.
The police ordered us to go behind.
You're a doctor.
Try to stay calm.
I'm so happy for Tom.
How old is he?
I don't think it will rain tomorrow.
Can I get a couple of towels?
It's not always easy to do what's right.
What happened to the bus in the airport?
He can talk to French.
This is your key.
I can't.
A car hit Tom.
What a strange thing!
I don't want Tom to see me that way.
He can talk to French.
It's just a matter of being alone that nobody's supposed to talk.
Have you ever been Boston?
That's a bad sign.
You can study here.
I'll call them once I get back tomorrow.
Come on in two.
I know Tom's tired.
I want some money.
Tom's dead.
Tom wanted to talk to you.
I'll keep an eye out.
No one knows me in Boston.
Contact Tom.
It's been snowing all night.
Which floor is it?
I need a taxi tomorrow evening.
I heard you screaming.
I don't see you.
I don't understand what you're talking about.
How much time do you go to sleep?
You'll have to do something about it very soon.
I earn 100 a day.
It's noon.
Please tell me the voice.
Are you out of your mind?
They shouted.
Turn left.
I killed Tom.
The library is left.
What does that mean?
Mary screams.
I learned English.
Eat whatever you like.
No doubt.
Children like cake.
Is Tom Jackson your real name?
Tom died.
Tell me what you need.
I haven't found my contact lens yet.
I was afraid of Tom's dog.
Tom saw him.
Your bike is like my bike.
Why do you want to go today?
Sit down.
Be careful with the car.
I watch TV.
Don't cry.
Tom wanted you to take it.
What did you bring?
He told me he'd go to Venice.
Excuse me.
Can you breathe?
He's younger than me.
I don't speak Japanese.
We're both right.
Tom slept outside.
Sit down.
Don't worry about me.
It's noon.
What happened?
I agree with you.
How much is that?
How can they forget us?
I understand your situation.
I'm not Tom.
Fa-da!
My book is here.
I'm Tom's wife.
I'm not very busy right now.
Where are you going on Monday?
They shouted.
Tom Jackson wrote three books.
Tom told me that today.
I don't want to go to Boston.
Your answer is wrong.
I know.
I'm having a little fun.
I'm not proud of that.
She's running.
The train came at the same time, so we didn't have to wait at all.
I'm not your friend.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Come with me.
Is that your new friend?
In any language you can write, all languages are equal in Tetoba.
Whatever I do, you never seem satisfied.
He might come.
He's an important person.
The train stops at all stations.
I didn't notice.
I'm not hungry.
What's wrong?
I can't attend the meeting.
This is a doctor.
I'm going down to the next station.
Are you a doctor?
I'm eating now.
You should ask him for advice.
Mark graduated from Harat, 1991.
My son knows the watch.
I'm looking for a nice hotel.
I'm a woman.
I'll be back at 10 times.
Don't confuse yourself.
I don't want to look at Tom.
He's a doctor.
Goodbye.
You look sick.
I need a partner.
Do you have to save me a seat?
Is that blood?
Call me tomorrow.
Hey, waiter, bring me some water.
Let's find where Tom is.
My mother can play a very good piano.
Can you speak French?
We're gonna eat now.
We win.
I went to Rome.
Please fill in this form?
We've seen it.
I'm glad to see you again.
They don't care.
How old do you want to marry?
My school was too late.
Forgive Tom.
Who's going to hurt Tom?
No one believes in suffering these days.
Let him go.
I'm optimistic.
Tom kept screaming.
How are you?
He can talk to French.
How old is this church?
I want to go to Australia again before my passport expired.
Right there.
You can go there.
I don't want to get involved in all this.
How many nights will you stay?
Is your husband at home?
This one can speak Japanese.
Tom's running.
We love coffee.
Let's hear what Tom has to say.
Tom loves me.
What did you forget?
I live here.
Tom was crying almost every day.
He folded his handkerchiefs and folded them.
Tom brought it.
I like him.
I'll cook.
Can you please tell me one more time?
I'll be back in three hours.
I'm yours.
Take Tom to the hospital.
Take my hand.
How can they forget us?
It's because you don't want to be alone.
Will you go shopping with me?
How old are you?
Don't go to the kitchen.
Call me tomorrow.
Sit where you want.
Tom doesn't want to hear it.
We're Arabs.
Tom's hurt.
Where do you live?
Just smile.
I lost your phone number.
Everyone's here.
Would you like something to eat?
I can swim.
Nothing left in the freezer.
Nothing happened.
Everyone lies.
I'm your friend.
Time's up.
Try more.
Have you ever eaten raw fish?
He was giving a speech.
I like him.
How tall you are!
I did my job.
I want my sheets.
I was crying.
I'm not feeling well.
His dog went wherever he went.
Aren't you a doctor?
I saw him running.
Tom's name is a boy and Mary's name is a girl.
Tom's in trouble, isn't he?
What's your name?
Let's get out of here.
What's that cost?
Do as he says.
I think the train's late.
It's noon.
I have two nephews.
Put that down.
Nobody's talking.
Tom's talking.
I'm going to do it.
What am I eating?
Keep Tom away from me.
What's your dad's name?
I want to take some money.
Eat your milk.
The people of Mercedes are weird.
People don't see the cones.
Let me tell you.
Tom loves chess.
I want you to come with me.
Tom Vau quu black.
Tom got angry.
Amor doesn't like coffee.
Sit here.
Eat your ass!
I heard you screaming.
Call me.
Welcome.
I want to buy some cheese.
Call the doctor!
I'm not worried.
Is this seat empty?
We're winning.
My brother is two years older than me.
Stop!
The hotel was built last year.
Everything eats.
I need my partner.
Stop that woman.
What are you going to do this tomorrow?
Don't talk.
In any language you can write, all languages are equal in Tetoba.
They live there.
This is his home.
Forty million people speak English as their first language.
This house is my grandfather.
Where can I buy the envelope?
Let him go.
I forgot his name.
He eats nothing but fruit.
Tom was with me all day.
How long does it take to get to the station?
Who ate?
Where can I buy tickets?
What's your grandpa's age?
He can speak Japanese.
How many numbers will we live to go to Wikiki?
My feet hurt.
What's the number of students?
You can study here.
To Tom, he's happy and excited.
He's younger than me.
Tom loves chocolate cake too.
I'll go now.
Have fun.
I was late last night.
Are you sick or cold?
Get what you want.
Don't call me.
Is that far from here?
Where's the boy?
What time does New York train leave?
I'm bored.
I like him.
Would you like to learn French?
Do you understand what I'm saying?
No one understands me.
Go away.
A country in New York.
He's sleeping like a child.
Can you show me your boarding pass?
Can you please help me?
He's younger than me.
It's never easy to win.
I'll take care of it.
Do you have time?
I thought you'd be here.
Tom's very upset.
I'm busy.
You can go home now.
He's younger than me.
I think Tom's fine.
I'll go back to Australia in two days.
Tom told Mary that she had gone to kill herself, but that didn't have the courage to do it.
Will you go fishing with us?
Although it's not bad for itself, in many cases, many people watch television too much.
You should ask him for advice.
I'll take him.
I'm cold.
I'm sorry.
I'm still your friend.
I still can't believe that I trusted Tom.
Be careful.
My son can't count on it.
Watch where you're going.
I eat.
I don't want to go shopping alone.
How far is the station from here?
He was sick at the end of last week.
Tom hit the door repeatedly, but no one came out.
He's a doctor.
Stop screaming.
I'm hurt.
Go to the hospital.
The ambassador came back.
Please move on.
The pen is broken.
Tom always keeps his word.
He eats nothing but fruit.
I deny it.
Wait outside.
I need a taxi now.
Shut up.
Who is he?
This happened at least three times.
Tom wants me to go with him.
We'll try!
Tom's tired.
Don't forget us.
Tom went to talk.
I'm on the south side.
You guys look tired.
Tom kept me waiting all afternoon.
He's eating.
He got sick at the end of last week.
I'll meet you next month.
We need to contact Tom's parents.
Where can I buy that magazine?
I'll be back in 7 minutes.
Is the lake so deep?
I'm late.
Call Tom.
What's the price?
Tom saw him.
What time is your plane?
Tom's tall, but not as tall as me.
She's my wife.
I'm not too good in swimming.
Where's the tourist office?
Don't go.
Your shoes are here.
He didn't tell me his name.
Okay, I'll see you later.
Do you live here?
What happened?
Home is $100, including the tax.
I'm not very good in French.
My father's going to China.
Can he speak French?
I want this.
I'm your friend, right?
Help me!
I'll help you.
I don't agree with him.
Call the police!
I was worried.
There's a cup on the table.
I'll be back in an hour.
I have to get off this ship.
That's Tom.
He hasn't come yet.
Kim had a sweet laugh.
I don't live in town.
Women make changes in the world.
Hurry up.
I don't want Tom to see me like this.
Tom screamed.
Tom doesn't want that.
It'll cost 30.
Let's start here.
We've been waiting for them.
I like yellow.
Tom fixed the promise to have a diary.
He doesn't eat anything but fruit.
I'm not your friend.
How old is he?
Come back.
Why are you screaming?
Can I have that check?
Do you have something bigger?
Tom earns me twice.
I need it.
I don't think you need any help.
Tom waited outside the gate.
Don't wait.
Is the museum open today?
Don't wait.
Don't worry about me.
Are we gonna eat out today?
Keep Tom away from me.
Tom's hurt.
He was crying.
Are my laundry cups ready?
Where can I buy it?
I need to send a fax.
He eats too much.
He taught me to write.
Call my husband.
I could play that song.
I was surprised.
Where's Boston?
You call us.
The rules are simple.
Can you keep an eye on Tom?
You're better than me.
He hasn't arrived yet.
I can't hit my right hand.
I'm in the hospital.
Tom caught the thief.
Tom, I want to talk to Mary.
Do you understand me?
Tom was surprised when he heard that John had married Mary.
Success depends on effort in most cases.
Tom laughs very well.
Tom shook his head.
Were you born there?
Everyone knows it now.
I've got my shoes.
I was surprised.
Do you live in this neighborhood?
The turtles have teeth?
We lost contact.
Can I get a cover?
Have you broken your bones?
I want to get off next stop.
How are you?
I'll go to the dentist.
I can't believe it!
A nose?
He's not here yet.
They're doctors.
Do you understand what I mean?
Have you ever been riding?
He was talking.
I have two veggies.
What's this about you?
I had nothing to tell Tom.
Try some more.
Tom laughed.
Why are you sitting there?
What is spoken in the U.S.?
I'm tired.
He has two daughters.
I wish you could talk to Tom.
I'm your friend.
Follow Tom.
Tom always keeps his word.
He's an experienced teacher.
I think you both know Tom.
Tom's here.
Everyone wishes happiness.
I forgot your phone number.
Tom lost.
You're tired, aren't you?
Is Tom Jackson your real name?
Go on.
Everyone saw it.
What time is the bus?
As Tom speaks French, I don't know anything about him.
I need this fellow.
He's a doctor.
What's your dad's name?
I want to know who started.
Don't go to the kitchen.
Not Siris!
May I?
Who ate?
Any kid can do that.

Tom's taking a big risk.
Are those yours?
What are you talking about?
I'll do it.
What's your name?
I agree with you.
You're rich.
Are you going to America next month?
I don't want to go swimming.
I don't own it.
Thank you very much.
He hasn't come yet.
I'm sorry!
I have so much to tell you.
The ice reflects the terrestrial ray.
Come out.
They shouted.
I ran away from home.
We made pancakes for breakfast.
Don't you have a bike?
I don't know if he'll come.
You're screaming.
He was crying.
He doesn't want to talk about it.
Everyone saw it.
I feed my cat every morning and evening.
My son came to my house.
I'm a student.
I'll be present.
Do you have your passport?
Please correct my accent.
Do as he says.
You look tired.
Tom started screaming.
Sit there.
I wasn't alone.
I've learned a lot from you.
It's wrong.
Tom always keeps his word.
Is Tom here?
I'm a doctor.
We've seen them.
Today is June 18 and it's Mulyreal's birthday.
Who won?
Come on, let's get ready.
We just have to ask Tom to do this for us, don't we?
Can we get these cups done?
I'm going to Osaka Station.
I don't think Tom is responsible for this.
Someone's crying.
I went to Bakery.
I learned to live without him.
My father's very good.
I want you to stay with Tom.
Please hurry up.
Tom was busy with work.
I'm not proud of the way I used it.
I shouted.
We'll do it.
He came.
I don't agree with him.
Follow me.
I'm screaming.
My hands and clocks aren't working properly.
Forget Tom.
How dare you!
Is that Tom's book?
He was angry.
Who are you?
I could have died.
Are you sure?
Let's go.
He neglects his studies.
I didn't want Tom to see me.
They eat healthy food.
My mother loves music.
He's easily mad at him.
Where he goes, his dog went after him.
Who is this?
Can I work here?
There's still a problem.
It's my drug depositing old bottles.
I love numbers.
I don't want to go.
When does the next bus leave?
What does that mean?
Don't you have a bike?
Do you want to come?
My mother can play good golf.
He knows where we live.
I know your name.
Tom's not here anymore.
What did you say?
He worked as our guide.
Tom stopped screaming.
How old is Tom?
Come soon!
Stop screaming.
Is Tom there?
I gave blood today afternoon.
My back is still hurting.
Where did Tom go?
They look like Americans.
You were Tom's only friend.
I went to the hospital.
I accept his invitation.
My father can drive very well.
I'll be alone.
You need a friend.
Forget Tom.
I think Tom said he was the first Jackson.
You've known Tom for so long.
I know.
I'm playing football now.
My stuff hasn't arrived yet.
Tom's not here yet.
Please wait until he arrives.
Tom rarely keeps his word.
Eat something.
Is there anyone at home?
What do you do?
I think Tom's fine.
Where do I get the stamp?
I'm going to scream.
Can he speak French?
Tom may not want to take it.
We love our country.
Is he a doctor?
A little more niby?
And one more day he left.
They wanted to steal the car.
I'm still your friend.
Stop that woman.
How old is that church?
Ask me tomorrow.
It's still mine.
Where am I supposed to claim my stuff?
We do what we want.
Tom's right.
I ran to my mother.
The book is for the students in the mother tongue who are not Japanese.
Tom wanted to be a minister.
Who would you trust?
He's a doctor.
You can talk.
That's what I deserve.
No one is essential.
Do you live here?
The rest of them laughed.
How long are you going to be?
Have you seen this man in this photo?
I've lost my stuff.
I think it's impossible for Tom.
I don't want to wake Tom.
My son is in the economy.
The sky looks like it's gonna start snow tonight.
How much does this cost?
You know very well what Tom wants.
We dance.
I can't stop the cough.
I just want Tom happy.
Those living in glass should not be stoned.
Why are you screaming?
Stop Tom.
I feel I should go to the hospital.
Tom wants his umbrella back.
Is Tom at home?
Tom always keeps his word.
I eat stuff.
I'm your friend.
How long have you been?
Who's here?
A river divided the east and west.
Come here yourself.
Do you know what he's saying?
I have to go to sleep.
Do you have a car?
Tom also plays the guitar.
Do you have any ideas to do now?
He's having lunch now.
Can you keep an eye on Tom?
You should ask him for advice.
This tooth hurts.
How much do these potatoes do?
How much money must be paid for?
Everyone liked Tom.
What happened here?
Here's your key.
Are you Japanese?
Hurry up.
Eat whatever you like.
Take this.
Have you ever broken your bones?
He was angry.
We learned English.
I couldn't move my right foot.
I'm dry.
How old is your grandfather?
Can I ask you a question?
What is that?
Here's your key.
We've seen worse things.
Help Tom.
I'm pretty sure.
What's that?
He's eating.
He likes rabbit carrots.
You didn't understand.
My heart hurts.
Sit at the table.
He's younger than me.
What's your name?
We've been waiting for you.
Tom was inside.
Can I use credit cards?
It's a big night, isn't it?
It's only found in French.
Tell me.
I'll take him.
Can I pay the credit card?
Tom found my bike.
I went to Jackson's house.
He was wearing a black hat.
Anything else?
Everyone shouted.
Any left for the students?
I eat noodles.
Tom's inside the house.
Don't ask what they think they're doing.
Will you come in?
I'll tell you.
We like football games.
Would you like to drink?
Good evening.
He eats empty fruits.
I want a new sauce for these shoes.
Everyone liked Tom.
Who's that?
I'm still your friend.
Rejoice.
Excuse me!
He runs.
I'll swim tomorrow even if it rains.
My right arm hurts.
My father was busy.
Everyone's ready to go.
I couldn't get the 7:00 train.
She had two daughters.
This is my wife.
Let's tell the story.
Do you have a pen?
Class doesn't start at 8:30.
You usually eat lunch time?
What does that mean?
How much can I get?
You speak English?
What they did is wrong.
My son is taller than I am.
Tom's parents were also singers.
Here's your mouth.
Tom's alive.
She looks pale.
Answer me.
This bag is mine.
Tom got angry.
How much does it cost?
You can eat as much as you want.
Let go.
I have a fever.
Can you speak French?
He's a doctor.
Fill it.
How old are you?
Get Tom.
They're screaming.
You're screaming.
I don't think it will rain tomorrow.
I'll be back when I'm finished.
I like the light.
He grew up in France.
He didn't work on Sunday night.
He taught me to write.
Happy birthday!
It's not your book. It's mine.
The Terojan people have been killed.
He eats nothing but fruit.
Tom's father is a composer.
Listen.
Do you think Tom wants to eat now?
It's a time.
I never make mistakes.
Where's the door to UA 111?
I'm a dog.
Why are you shouting?
Tom wants his umbrella back.
You usually go to bed at what time?
The two countries have accomplished a deal between themselves.
I speak only French with Tom.
Tom got his eyes.
Can you tap this off?
Tom's at Garde.
What did you forget?
I really don't want to go.
You go first.
That's my sister.
I forgot.
He's laughing.
He hasn't come yet.
It's not mine.
Who came?
He's getting fruit.
I don't speak Japanese.
I'll be grateful.
The cowards released the prisoners.
I could have gone with you, but I didn't have time.
I lost my wallet.
He's a good man.
We did it.
The government's slowing down taxes.
Get out of town!
Count to the point.
He's eating.
How old is that church?
Let's go!
This one can speak Japanese.
Did you see him get out of here?
Where's the shell bus left for the airport?
Don't fight.
That's my cat.
That bag is mine.
I have an old computer that I don't need anymore.
I've got a cure.
We were on foot.
I want this.
I need those papers.
Tom screamed.
Tom smiles very little.
Get what you want.
Tom is crying.
How much does it cost?
I'm fine.
They're doctors.
The plane crashed at 9 o'clock.
I don't know what you mean.
Most of the audience were businessmen.
Turn right.
Tom's probably asleep.
I'm so hungry.
Tom won a lot.
He knows where we live.
I learned a lot from Tom.
Tom potatoes are dust.
Everyone was screaming.
I'll be outside.
My mother can cook better.
They shouted.
The research was successful.
I think there's little chance that Tom's got gold to keep it.
Boston is a big city.
I'm 17.
Here's your key.
Forget Tom.
Eat your milk.
Both of us are Tom.
They were all happy.
Is that your book?
I don't want to go with Tom.
Who broke the flower?
Tom's hurt.
Get behind Tom.
Is Tom still mad at me?
Tom's down.
We've been waiting for you.
I'm not perfect.
Do you know what he said?
Listen carefully.
We've made a lot of mistakes.
Why are you shouting?
What's your father's name?
Look over there.
Let me know if there's anything I can do.
We tried.
Tom resigned in October.
The market is next to the doctor's shop.
Happy Canada Day!
I'm gonna be late.
What does this sign mean?
Tom got his head off.
Are we ready?
I like Tom's blueapple.
He was very patient.
How old are you?
Listen carefully.
Would you like to go shopping with me?
Take it easy.
They live there.
I'll scream.
Everyone is exhausted.
Don't fuck me.
Who was it?
I'm shy.
When I said that Mary had left town, Tom was really surprised.
I heard screams.
What time is your plane?
You don't want to talk about that.
My book seemed interesting.
Tell me what happened.
I'm up to 8 today.
Please burn the light.
Tom's hurt.
I'm still your friend.
It took me more than two hours to translate a few pages into English.
Are those yours?
Who's that?
Is it the youngest way to the station?
Tom tried to kill Mary.
Do you know him?
It's impossible!
How did the train reach Yokohama?
What time is it?
The words that don't correct the right ones can be submitted to more normal translations.
Your shoes are here.
Is everything ready for tomorrow?
Has anyone left me any news?
I want to cook for you.
Excuse me, does this train reach Washington Square?
We failed.
There's an AC in this room.
Did you wear it all over?
Tom Boston was there.
Make it clear.
Don't open that.
Tom saw him.
It might wear ice in the evening.
I'm not proud of that.
Is there anyone there?
It's a mistake.
I'm not young anymore.
He's eating.
It's just blood.
Would you like to catch fish with us?
Wait right here.
I'll be back in 20 minutes.
One minute.
Tom was wounded.
Mary explains.
I don't deny it.
Don't look!
Finish it as soon as possible.
Use this.
How did the train reach Yokohama?
I don't understand that either.
This morning, I got seven hours.
I'm home.
Take it easy.
Merry Christmas!
I'm going in.
Me too.
I'm not a busy man.
It's beautiful.
Do it again!
Tom started to cry.
They're kids.
I don't want to argue with you.
"Why don't you go?" "Why don't I want to go?"
I know that.
I'll be around.
Call me tomorrow.
Tell me what you want.
My feet hurt.
Ask Tom.
I wonder what I'll give you for my birthday.
Don't forget the ticket.
It's good to see you again.
Why are you shouting?
Stay right there.
Eat the food you like.
We played in a park.
I'm busy.
Where can I buy tickets?
I finished my job.
I'm planning to stay at the hotel.
I finally got my keys.
Tom screamed.
I'm not arguing.
Can you read?
How old is your father?
Are you okay?
I've never seen Tom more happy than this.
Don't go in.
We're lost.
Tom's screaming.
We can still do that.
I tried.
I'm sick.
I'm just looking. Thank you.
Unfortunately, it's true.
We've been waiting for them.
How old do I look?
Tom's not happy here.
He got angry.
I don't like my coffee.
Speak slowly.
Can I get your phone number?
Why do you want to meet Tom?
Here's your kid.
We don't care what he does.
I called my best friend Tom.
We can't play better than this.
We're shy.
I'll pay the bill today.
Tomorrow I'm going to Paris.
You'll never be alone.
You can go there.
We both know it's not fair.
Eat whatever you like.
I have wine.
Why did Tom cry?
