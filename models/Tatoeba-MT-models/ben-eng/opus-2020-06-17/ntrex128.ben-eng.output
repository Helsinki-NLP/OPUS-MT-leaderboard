Wels Asmbly members are worried about their own ‘likes’
A number of emergency members are threatening about the changes they made in MWP (Mamba of the Welsh Parliament).
The terror is a proposal to change the name of Assibly to Parliament.
Assambely members of political parties fear to face ridicule through the name.
A Labor team member said his team is worried that "the new position is "wapp and rhythmy with Pwp"
Welsh is for its outside readers: In Wells, Twp means fools and Pwp means Mall.
A playmate said that as a group, they were "not happy" and suggested alternative.
One member of the Wells Conzarved Party said that the group's change of name was "attitude" but noted that the accents between MWP and Lagert are slightly different.
In this sense, the words of Wesh W are like the words of the U.S. English-language U.S.
Assemblet Commission, which currently rules for the start of the name-change process, says: "The final decision must be made about what will happen to the members of the Assimly.
The Govs of Wales Act gives 2017 Wels Asmbrey the right to change their names.
In June, the commission published the results of a public opinion where the proposal to change the name of the event was a huge support for the Wells Parliament.
Regarding the position of the Assembly members, the Commission is supporting the MWP, but according to John MWP has the highest support.
Apparently, Asmbly members are recommending different options, but Presiding Officer, it would be difficult for Eliin Jones to reach the same level, which is supposed to be submitted within a couple of weeks.
The reforms will have different changes in the course of activity, including the disparity of the Asmbly members and the design of the committee.
After the debate, the Associated Members will receive a final vote on what their positions deserve.
Macedonians are voting in a referendum on change of country's name
Voters will decide whether to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia" on Sunday.
The popular vote was made to avoid the decades-long conflict between neighboring Greece - who has their own Macedonia province.
Athens has long claimed that its northern neighbor's name is a symbol of the integrity of its region and has repeatedly objected to its appeal for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Macedonia's president, Jijj Ivanov, who is against the referendum on change, says he will ignore the referendum.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zhan Jaev, believe that the change of name is a necessary step to join the European Union and NATO.
Herlem's churches remain silent during the hours of St. Martins' fruit.
"The old people I spoke to say that there was a church and bar in every corner of the world," said Mr. Adams.
"No one of them today."
He said that the bars were understood to disappear.
Currently, social networks are "people have different ways".
"The bars aren't the living room where everyone goes regularly."
In the church’s case, he is worried that property sales will continue as long as the leaders think, "and today, tomorrow and tomorrow, will return where they started."
He also said that the church could build apartment buildings and Condomiums where people who would live without helping the rest of the mosques.
"The people who buy Condomiums will be white," he said, "and so they will speed up the day of the closing of these churches because most people in Condinium are hopelessly members of the church."
Both churches were established by the white congregation before Herlem became a black tribal city - in 1870, and St. Martins over a decade later.
The main white methodist left the church in 1930.
A nearby black congregation owned the building.
Under Rev John Howard Johnson, a black congregation took over Saint Martins, who led a boycott against retailers at AHandred and Twentyyf Street for refusing to hire black workers and promotion.
The building was badly damaged by a fire accident in 1939, but the residents of the Father Johnson were planning to restore it, and they arranged the memorial.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and Heir of St. Martinés proudly called the Carriment "the bell of the Great People."
The expert who played the Carandon last July called it something different: "A historical treasure" and "an unprecedented historical instrument."
Experts, Tifani Niong, from the University of Michigan, also said that this is the Orthm Carsion of the Earth, which was also devoted to the play of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriwayder says St. Martins didn't replace him.
The events that took place in St. Martinés in the past few months are a complex story of the founders and owners, whom were appointed by the General Leaders of the Church or the APSOpal Diosis.
In July, the Vestri - a styresary body made up of ordinary leaders - was concerned that they thought they would "bonosis Vestrtor" would be transferred, despite the work of the diary founders and owners.
Some members of Parish have complained of lack of transparency in the work of Diasis.
The shark attack was injured after 13-year-old Geda was drowned for shrimping in California.
A 13-year-old boy has been injured in a shark attack after the first day of shrimping for shrimping on Saturday, officials reported.
The attack took place around the NC Niñas neighborhood seven a.m. until then.
He told KSWB TV of Chad Hammmel San Diego that he was able to get him out of the water when he heard the boy cry for help for nearly half an hour a Saturday morning.
"At first he thought the boy was screaming at a shrimping noise, but then "you can understand that the boy, the boy, was screaming because he had me bite!"
'He bit me!'
Her throat came apart, "Hamelel said she could reach the boy.
"I yell for everyone to come out of the water: there are sharks in the water!" added Hamel.
The boy was sent to a hospital in San Diego, where he was in severe condition.
A species of sharks are unknown.
A few weeks ago, a shark appeared in the area, but it was identified as not dangerous species.
ZAZES also said that the infected man has been severely injured on top of his roof.
Officials have banned entry into the beach to Swamismi in the Nestas of Antisabladdas and for 48 hours for security reasons.
Zeylos reports that there are over 135,000 species of sharks in the area, most of which are not dangerous.
Sensbaris plans to enter the UK market.
Sensbers Boots, superdrags and Debenhams are competing in the business of the department store with a form-sized attitude like slows and experts.
As part of a strong effort to enter the United Kingdom’s 2.8 billion-pound industry market, this large scale tree will be launched around 11 stores across the country and will be launched if proven successful, other shops will grow in the United Kingdom's silver market, where fashion and housing goods are being marketed.
The investments are coming up in the silver industry as supermarkets are sometimes looking for new ways to fill the shells full with TV, microwaves and household goods.
Sensbers says it will double its silversmiths to double the size of 3,000 products for the first time with revitalation, Eg, Tizman and Dr. P. P.
La'real, Mebelin, and Barts Bjay will receive more already-responsive ranges, including brandings like boots.
The supermarket’s bootmic makeup ranges so that most of the products become Vgan Friendli - which has become very popular among young customers.
In addition, the perfume vendor The Fregres Shyp will conduct the distribution of goods at the Cinsbaris shop, the first of which was launched last week in South London, and the second part will be launched in Birmingham's Selly Ok after this year.
Buying small food at an online shopping and local grocery store means that the supermarkets have to work extra hard to meet customers.
Mike Sare, Chief Executive of Censburys, said that the outlets need to look like department stores as the supermarket chain is competing with owners like Adli and Ledal, and will have more services and no food-no goods.
After two years of buying Argos and Habitats chains, the company has placed Argos Outletlets in stores and has also opened several Hbitats, which claims that the sale of grocery goods and acquisitions is more profitable.
The supermarket failed before the construction of its forms and pharmacy departments.
In the early 2000s, Cinsberis had a joint project testing the project with Boots, but the project stopped due to conflict over how benefits from the Kemist shop would be received in the supermarkets.
Censberos is using this new strategy after he sold his farm at 281 stores to the farmhouses of Lloyds Ferces, who owns Celecio.
The company said that Miltons will play this plan by adding a luxury range of skincakes, including a pose and Vishi at four stores.
Paul Mills-Hyx, the commercial director of Sensbers, said: "We changed the rice-stricts in order to improve the environment for our customers.
We've also invested especially trained workers who will be present to offer advice.
Our brand ranges have been designed to provide all the needs of our needs and because of the attractive environment and facilities we now have become a reliable approach that challenges shopping methods."
Peter Jones' 'Agarshma' after being removed from the deal of 11 million pounds.
Peter Jones, a TV presenter, was taken down by Peter Jones’ Lifes Agent Peter Jones for his agreement with the Holi Willobi Marks and ITTV to focus on his new agreement with him.
Willowbe has no time for their household goods and subtitling brands.
The couple was compared to Gineteth Paltro's Glutro Gülter brand.
This morning presenter, 37, reported his departure on Instagram.
Holy Willowbi, star of Dragon Den, has angered Peter Jones by the final moment of their attractive life-saving brand business - which is intended to focus on his new bumper deal with Marks and SpV.
According to sources, Jones became angry when on Tuesday, at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlé, Bachhamshire, a golden girl admitted that she had no time for her new deal – which cost up to 1.5 million pounds – for their household goods and institution Brandy.
The business was compared to Gineteth Paltro's polymer brand and was expected to double the wealth of Willobe's 11 million pounds.
After news of his departure from Truley on Willowbi, 37, Instagram, Jones took off the jets to Britain for his holiday home.
According to one source: “So far Truth was the top of the list of Halli’s higher rankings.
It was part of his long-term future plans which would require his financial need for the next few decades.
His decision to withdraw has shocked everyone involved.
On Tuesday, no one could believe the Wawa incident. The project was supposed to start too soon.
At the headquarters of Marló, there is a storage product ready for sale."
Experts think that this morning's host who is currently one of the most reliable celebrities in Britain can harm the firm by leaving because they've already been investing millions of pounds of money on candles, clothes, and household goods, and it will likely be lost in the delay of its launch.
And that would end a long day friendship.
Ma Willowbi of three children and her husband Dan Boudwin had been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for over a decade.
Willowbi started true with Cap in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the president in March 2016.
The couple spend their vacations together, and Jones has 40% share in the farm produced by Baldwin.
Willoby will be a brand ambassador for MdS and replace Ant McPartlin as host of IATV’s event host.
A source close to Jones said yesterday night: "We will not comment on his business dealings."
Complex discussion 'and then we fell in love'
He jokes about the positive attitude towards the North Korean leader and makes a comment that some people would consider to be "un-President".
Why did you give up President That much?
In his speech "news presenter".
"I never gave a leave."
Kim is willing to meet again after their primary meeting in Singapore in June, which he calls their first encounter with North Korea as a big step towards destabilization.
But the nuclear destabilization dialogue has gone to the scene.
More than three months after the conference in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomats Ri Young Ho told world leaders on Saturday that the United Nations General Assembly could not see any "related reaction" towards North Korea's previous unarmed move.
However, he says the US has banned pressure.
While speaking at his rally, __________________________________________
"We're in good position with North Korea," he says.
"We were at war with North Korea.
It could have killed more than one million people.
Now we have a great relationship."
He claimed that his efforts to improve relations with Kim brought positive results - ending the rocket examinations, releasing prisoners, and bring back the rest of the American workers home.
And he supports the unusual approach to talk about Kim.
"It's easy to be president, but instead of trying to get there in this crowded area with 10,000 people, it's only 200 people standing outside," the trumpet pointed out to him with his finger to be right in front of the public.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed an island, killing hundreds of people.
After the Lombc earthquake, for example, foreign private organizations were told that they do not need help.
Although more than 10 percent of the population had been displaced, no national disaster was announced, a prerogative to receive international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they are very clear that they are not requesting international cooperation, so the matter is challenging," Ms. Sambaong reports.
Although Save the Children gathers a team to move to Palmer, foreign workers are not sure if they can work on the field.
Mr. Sutopo, the spokesman for the National Disaster Organization, said that Indonesian officials have been assessing the situation of Palur in order to determine whether foreign organizations are allowed to participate in relief operations.
In the wake of Indonesia's regular earthquake, the country is extremely unsurpassed for the anger of nature.
Although the tsunami shelters have been built in the Aché, it is fair to witness the shelter near other shores.
Despite the warnings, the tsunami alert in Palahu was apparently due to lack of alerts, perhaps behind loss of life.
Many Indonesian islands are still challenging traveling when it's time to get better.
Natural disasters make the communications even more difficult.
A ship dedicated to hospital for the victims, but it will take at least three days to reach the location of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia's Jaazeral infrastructure was at the center of his campaign, and he invests a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the lack of investment before the restoration of next year continues to hold the government of Mr. Joko.
Mr. Joko is under pressure from Indonesian long-term sectarian tensions, where Muslim majority have adopted their religion's more conservative way of life.
In the riots between Christians and Muslims, more than 1,000 people were killed and more than 10,000 people were displaced, two groups fighting in the streets with the Da, arrow bows and other violent weapons.

The statue of Chrowell in the parliament is a new victim of the march of “History of History.”
The statue will be removed by his religious followers after the Taliban's destruction of many cultural and religious monuments in England.
But the Chromwell Society has informed Mr. Creek that "inappropriate" and "trying to reassemplify history."
The president of the Chrowell Society, John Goldsmith, said: "The sign of the statue of Oliver Chrowell, which will be the target of Westminustar, is beyond Westminustar's palace in the current location of the removal, was inevitable.
The iconoclizm was not edited by Chromwell or by him during the English House War.
In the previous century, the statue of Chrowell will be sacrificed for his former successor Thomas's karma.
The great statue of Zrowell, made by Sir William Wennikt, is a sign of the 19th century's opinions and a part of a historical character that many people consider to be worthy of celebration.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "In his case, many people consider Chrowell as the guardian of the Parliament in the face of outward pressure, against the monarchy, which is now the opinion of many in the 19th century, even though there are less people.
But it is part of the ongoing historical debate if it is a complete accurate image of the day.
As sure, the conflict between the 17th century has turned our nation's future development, and Chrowell is a well-known figure who represents a side of the department.
It is worth celebrating and remembering as Lord Protector."
The pig killed Chinese farmers.
According to local news reports, a pig attacked a farmer in a southern China market.
The man, whose name is only identified as "Yian", was found in a report from a South China Morning Post post on Sunday that found him in the Lupansu market in Guijo province of South China with arthritis.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer is preparing to give vaccines to a pig farm in Shaining, the province of Kinghai, China.
It was announced that he came to the market on Wednesday to sell 15 piggies from the province of Yunan.
The next morning, her dear brother found her dead and found that the door of a pig’s stable was open.
He said that there was a big man pig in the stable with blood on his face.
A forensic testing confirms that the pig with 550 pounds of weight killed the farmer, reports the report.
"My Mama's leg was blood and deranged," said Mamatate, who was identified as "Uu" by Guyang Ivining News.
The footage of the security camera shows Yuan entered the market on Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
About an hour later, he was found dead.
The pig killing this man is not the man or his aunt.
One manager from the market told Evining News that police are collecting evidence of the scene and holding the pig apart so that it can't attack anyone else.
Yuan's family and market authorities are discussing the amount of compensation for his death.
Although rare, there have been cases of attacks on pigs before.
In 2016, a woman and her husband launched a pig attack on their farm in Massachusetts to make the man seriously injured.
Ten years ago, the pig with a 650 pounds weighs a 650 pounds kept the wells farmer under his tractor until his wife arrived and threatened the pig.
In 2012, when Oregon ate his pig, a farmer in Manhattan told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that they can serve as "san" or "deep."
"They're only messing with us.
They bite short bites, highly interested creatures... but they don't try to hurt anyone.
But you have to go with them enough understanding," he says.

Police clashes with Catalan separatists in front of the anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday during the clashes between supporters of independence protesters when they joined protesters against the celebration of the first year of voting by Center of Venaliya, which has caused disagreement among the public.
A group of masked separatists threw eggs at them in the face of a barrier to the police, and black powders which led to the creation of black clouds in the streets, usually filled with tourists.
The fighting started in the next day which police used batons to stop.
For a few hours, the protesters faced solidarity slogans such as "Long Live" and "No to Forget, Not to Forgive" who chanted slogans such as "Long Live".
The local news reported that 14 people were treated for minor injuries due to protests.
Since the October 1 referendum in Madrid was declared illegal by separatists, there has been excitement in the area.
The voters voted for independence, although the number of voters was low because most of the people boycotted the vote against the separation.

He added, "The unrest continues to grow."

As a result, the Jardard's team went off this season without a way to win the Premiership and on Sunday they'll face the top-top heart on Sunday, which is eight points ahead.
Earlier, on Thursday, Rangers at the Europe League will give Vienna an entry.
Livingston, they have already played six games in the division, last month, Chief Coach Holt, is still not able to taste defeat instead of Kenny Miller.
Livingston missed several wishes against their loanless opponent.
They should have been ahead long before the Holt's team was round, since their aggressive attitude caused all kinds of problems for the Rangers!
Scott Robinson went on to go around but failed to improve his efforts, and Alan Lithgo could only lead his efforts to the length of his journey, following the slides to meet Craig Halet's Header.
The hosts let the Rangers play in front of themselves, knowing that the guests can trouble Set.
And that's the important goal that came to be.
Rangers got a free-key container and opened the Livingston roundbook, together to set up Deklan Gala and Robinson Menga, who scored a goal from the center of a box in a touch.
At this stage, the Rangers' force was in control, but they were learning to protect the welcomes, and goalkeeper Loam Kelly spent most of his time in a fixture.
The trend continued to stand in the second half, although Alfred Morelos held a shot at Kelly.
Scott Pitman was defeated by Rangers' goalkeeper Alan McGregor's feet and another set of pieces for Living from the Lethgo Wide, to Livingston.
Crosss were going to the Livington box and were constantly clear, although the claim of two Pentality, the alternative to Glen Middleton, was rejected after he was challenged by Helett and the Handballs.
'Is it unbelievable 'Workerston' analysis
Létmont of Alasdia, BBC Scotland, Tony McArreni Ariña
A great performance and results for Livingston.
For some, they were awesome, but they continued to raise their expectations.
Since their return to the top, their playing style and player have rarely changed, but credit has to be taken to Hoalt for the way he was united.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halet was great, created a greatly organized defense, and kept Menga Con Goldson and Joe Waral always.
Although Rangers were less inspiring.
They fell under the yoke as good as they were.
Their lack of final ball - only once they opened the welcome - and it's a warning for Rangers, who are at the middle table.

The Indonesian earthquake, which killed hundreds of people in the tsunami, is being witnessed by the source of the toll increase.
At least 364 people were killed on the beach after a massive earthquake and tsunami hit Sulawi Island, Indonesia, and many were reported on Saturday by authorities.
Thousands of people gathered on the beach on Friday, Palu City, when the waves broke into the high shores of six meters (18 feet), which swept many people towards their death and destroyed everything on the road."
The tsunami came after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
“People continued their activities on the beach during the recent tsunami threats and those who didn’t run immediately and were targeted,” said Sutopo Dón Noro Gnoro, spokesman for the Indonesian disaster agency, Sutopore, a Brifing in Jakarta.
"Sunmy herself didn't come from, it pulled cars, logs, houses, hits everything above the ground," Norogroho adds that it was 800 km (497 miles) before the tsunami hit the shore.
Some people survived the tsunami and they survived,
About 16,700 people have been moved to 24 locations in Palru.
Photos published by Disaster Organization show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have collapsed and collapsed and a mosque has been drowned.
Aftershocks also continue on Saturday visiting Díaz in the coastal city.
The series was felt in the region with 2.4 million people.
According to a statement by the Indonesian Agency for the Assment and Application (BPPT) that the power released by the massive earthquake on Friday was almost 200 times greater than the power of a nuclear bomb in Hiroshima, with the power of a nuclear bomb on the second world war.
The geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, can increase the shape of a tsunami
Nugroho describes the damage as "speech", saying thousands of houses, hospitals, shoppings and hotels have collapsed.
Some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed building, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing."
The damages and damages can be much higher in Dingala, in a coastal area located on the coastal coast of Palmu and about 300 miles (190 km) north of the coast.
The communication system "was completely paralyzed without any data" said Nugroho.
“Red Cross issued a statement, and added that workers and volunteers are going to the affected region.”
"It's already a tragedyd, but it could be worse."
The agency was widely criticized for not giving the information that the tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived during the alert.
On social media footage, one of the men in the building above found the people listening to the news of the tsunami warning.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water hit the shore and swept away the building and the car.
Reuters didn't immediately prove the footage.
Power outages caused by earthquakes and tsunamis which cut communications around Palu and made the authorities uncomfortable the rescue efforts.
With the help of the army, Jakarta and other cities, authorities said that rescuers are in dire need of food and other basic necessities.

But it hasn't been announced yet.
Alylia Alarani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross, said, "It's still a province-wide disaster."
If the government says yes, it is a national disaster, then we can start international assistance, but we have not received much announcement yet.
Friends and families of missing persons are also expecting a miracle on Friday night of the tsunami that will give them hope at the end of a violent natural disaster.

Cain West: A new name to be changed.
Which is changing the name of the West.
By announcing this change, he wrote on Twitter on Saturday: "The official Cain West."
West, 41, was well known as Yee for a while and used his name as his name.
The name changed before his appearance on the White Live, where he hoped to expose his new album.
The event producer said he replaced singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled the event for "instruction reasons".
West before, said that the word is religious, as well as a short look of his present professional name.
At the beginning of the West Year, radioist Big Boy discussed the album's title, saying, "YE" is the most used word of the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you".
"So I'm yours, I'm ours, that's us.
From Cain, which means only person, Yee reflects our good, bad, our confusion, everything.
This album reflects more than our identity."
He was one of the most famous people who changed his name.
Shawn Coumbs is known in various ways as Paff Daddy, PD or DD, but this year he announced that he liked profits and brother-in-laws more.
A former West associate, J-G, O Hefen, has worked with no hifens and capital.
The AOLO of Mexico has vowed not to use the military against civilians.
Mexican President Andrés Manuel López has vowed to mark the 50th anniversary of the bloody torture against the students that he will not use military force against the people.
López Abrado promised on Saturday at the Tolatoloco plaza that "do not use military force to torture the people of Mexico."
On October 2, 1961, soldiers shot at peaceful protests that killed 300 people when the left-wing student movement in Latin America was building its own strong stance.
López Abardo's young man apologized to Mexicans for helping build monthly education and a more government university.
He says the lack of access to unemployment and education has drawn young people to the criminal association.
The U.S. should pay twice as much money on artificial intelligence.
As China continues to be more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should also double the cost of research by artificial thinkers and investors Kai-Fou Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This statement comes from various governments, in the United States, that US has an official strategic shortage of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China has launched its new plan last year: to achieve the number 1 in the 2030s of artificial intelligence.
Lee continues: "The double budget of intelligence research will start a new one where most countries are far behind and we are looking for the next step towards progressing in artificial intelligence."
double-funded funds can double the possibility of obtaining big artificial intelligence in the United States, in an interview with CBCK this week, Lee said.
Lee, one of China's leading artificial intelligence agencies, "China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order", has been investing in Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegi Melon worked on an artificial intelligence system at the University of Carnegi, defeating the highest ranking American player, and he studied with Microsoft Research Executive and the Google Branch.
Lee confessed to the previous US government's technology competition, like the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Development Project, to determine the next step.
In the United States, researchers often work hard to win government donations, says Lee.
"China's not removing academic leaders; corporates are doing it," Lee says.
Facebook, Google, and other technology organizations have appointed enlightened students from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee says changes in immigration policies can help boost the efforts of a AI in the United States.
“I think that Green Card should be automatically offered to Ph.D. on artificial intelligence,” he said.
The Chinese State Council of China has announced its next generation's artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
China's National Science Foundation academics such as the National Science Foundation and other government agencies spend money on American researchers, but China's academic work is low, says Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defense Department established a joint artificial intelligence center, which means the involvement of art and academics, and the White House has announced that the election committee will be formed on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DRPA AI announced $2 billion investment in an initiative called Next.
As the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million per year in artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, the US law did not see progress within a few months, attempting to build the National Protection Commission for artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians voted in a referendum on whether to rename the country or not.
On Sunday, Macedonians voted in a referendum on whether to change the name of "the Republic of North Congo" or not, a step that would solve the old conflict between Greece and Greece that blocked the attempts of European Union and NATO.
Greece, where Macedonia exists, represents a northern neighbor's claim and has vetos into NATO and the European Union's entry.
The two governments have made an agreement on June under the new name, but nationalist opponents believe the change will undermine ethnicity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Ziyj Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum and doubt that the turn out to be legal to be legal in the boycotting referendum would be 50 percent.
The question in the referendum ballot was: "You are staying for NATO and EU membership, including the agreement with Greece."
Supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Jaev, argued in favor of the price to enter the European Union and NATO organizations for Macedonia, one of the countries that came from the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I am here today for the future of the country, in Macedonia, to vote for young people so that they can live freely in the shadow of the European Union because it means life for all of us," Olives Gorgev of the 79-year-old, said in Skopje.
While the law is not mandatory, appropriate members of parliament have said that they will comply with the results of the vote through decision-making.
The parliament needs two-thirds majority to change names.
The State Election Commission said that there were no reports of abuse at 1 p.m.
However, only 16% of the votes were cast compared to 34% of the 2016 National Assembly when registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, we have a place in Europe," said José Tenski, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Jaev, his wife, and his son Duskko voted in favor of a change in the country's name in Macedonia, opening the way for NATO and the EU to join Macedonia on 30 September, 2018.
Vladimir Kavandakhkov, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavskakov, was preparing a small stage in Skopje in front of the tents set up by those who boycott the referendum.
"We're with NATO and the European Union, but we want to join our heads raising our heads," said Kavadurkov.
"We are poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us to be Macedonian, we can go to others like China and Russia and become part of Russia's unity in Euro-Estia."
Prime Minister Jaev says NATO's union will provide essential investments in Macedonia, where unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I believe it will be a large majority favor because more than 80 percent of us are in favor of the European Union and NATO," Jaev said after his ballot.
He said that a yes result would be our "constitution of the future."
According to a survey released last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, 30 to 43% of voters will participate in the referendum.
In another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
A total of 70 percent said they would vote yes.
The referendum needs to be over 50 percent of the votes to succeed.
The referendum's failure to take power in May last year will represent the first deadly blow in the Western pro-government policy.
Look: Sarge Aguro in Manchester City enters the whole Bibon Defense for the goal.
On Saturday, after winning a 2-0 strip in Manchester City, England, Breio Aguro and Reem Sterling had no choice.
At the 65th minute, Aguro made it too easy to see her score.
In Midfield at the beginning of Buenos Aires, Argentinian Stryker got a pass.
Before going to the open field, he ran through three Brighton Defenders.
Aguro was then surrounded by four Green Jerseys.
Before several others went beyond the Bushon Box, he turned a duffer around.
Then he pushed a pass to the left, which they found Starling.
Using her first touch in the English forward box, she returned to Aguro, who was using her right boots to beat Matthew Ryan, a German soldier.
"Aguro is fighting for some trouble on his foot," city manager Pep Gardola told reporters.
"We spoke 55, 60 minutes about her game.
That's what happened.
We are lucky he did a goal at that moment."
Sterling, however, gave Sky Blues the primary advantage of the Premier League's fight.
The goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguaro found the ball deep in the Breton region.
He sent the ball to Liye Sen with a nice way to the left.
He took a few touchs before he was moved to a remote post.
Sky Blues tapped the ball onto the net just before it crossed the horizon.
The city champions League will fight Huffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55 in the rain-neck of Cenheim, Germany.
Cherger Spear vs Rocks wants to play games.
There was no reason to be forced to start anything else after the removal of Nationals from the play off.
However, the never-ending Cheerer hopes he will stand up against Colorado Rocks on Sunday, only if it has a playoff in favor of Rockoffs, against the NL West's Lead against Los Angeles Dodges.
Rocks got at least a wild card run by winning the 5-2 splits on Friday night against Nationals, but they are still trying to achieve their first division.
"Although we're not playing for anything, at least we can step in rubber to find out the effect that Denver and the other team are facing me at the highest level this year.
"Why wouldn't I want to compete?"
Nationals haven't announced a startup for Sunday, but there is obvious that Sherazar might be in such a situation.
Sherzar, who will start his 34th time on Thursday, threw a Bulgarian session and dances with him on Sunday.
This season is the 220/3 Inings 2.53 ERA and 300 Strakeout in Washington, along with 18-7.
West Virginia Assembly
While highlighting the importance of the Republican vote within the mid-term elections, the president made a powerful mention of the situation around the situation in the relationship, choosing his Supreme Court.
"All we have done is at risk in November.
Five weeks from one of our most important elections in our lifetime.
It's a big, big: I'm not running, but I'm really running all over the place to fight for the great candidates," he said.
This post is part of our special coverage Languages and the Internet.
And they're determined to take back the energy by using any means they need, you see the lowness, the misogyny.
They don't care who hit, with strength and control, and whom they have to be crushed, they just want power and control, we won't give it to them."
He said that the Democraticrs are on a mission to "responsible and prevent."
"And you saw it for the last four days," he says, "the Democraticrs are "inhuman and vulnerable and unfaithful."
He called on the Democratic Senator Dian Lost, the Senate's judicial committee to name the Vice President, who had received a loud voice from the audience.
"Remember his answer?
Did you expose the document?
Ah, uh, what?
No, no, I wait - it was a really bad body - the worst part I've ever seen."
Labor is not a free-minded organization.
Those who are in their minds can't bear what is right here.
When the staff of the party Momentam in my area voted guilty, it wasn't surprising.
I was the last Labor MP in the list to tell you how you're going to feel about this, because you're not welcome in your mind.
My parliamentary colleague, young Ryan, was treated like this because he firmly stood up against Judaism.
In my case, I was accused of agreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
Regarding the importance of an accountable economic policy, the issue of Europe and national security and the similar issues, in which Jeremy was not in favor of previous leaders.
On Friday, Noingham's notice for the East Labor Meeting said that "we want to include and produce meetings."
As a local Labor MP in eight years, this is the first time that the GC meeting was completed on Friday night.
Unfortunately, today, this is not the sound of the meeting and the commitment to "mercy" politics has long been forgotten, if indeed it ever begins.
It is growing that dissent is not tolerated at the Labor Party and each opinion is judged as acceptable for party leadership.
It started soon after being Jeremy's leader, with colleagues I thought I would share a similar political perspective and asked me to take a stand that I did not agree with at all - whether national security or a single market.
Every time I speak openly - and even if I say it doesn't matter - I'm asked to remove it on social media, the center politics is condemned, and I'm told that I shouldn't be at the Labor Party.
And it's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more lucky than some of my colleagues, because the comments I pointed to are political too.
I was surprised to see colleagues who face the storm of discrimination or racism on a daily basis based on gender, but I never feel ashamed of their professionalism and determination.
The most frustrating aspect of politics in this era is how the level of hate has become normal
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that Labor Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer free-minded and undermines every “inappropriate” vote or election rule.
For the last two years, many were suggesting me to lower my head, not be so loud and I'm "right"
But I've come to politics.
When I joined Labor 32 years ago, we were moved by the neglect of the six-year-old government that literally destroyed our broad school classes, I was trying to provide necessary public service to those most necessary — whether it is the local Council or the State Minister.
I have never hidden my politics with my last election.
No one in the Natingham East was confused about my position and the field of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who promoted this movement on Friday, I can only say that when the country is moving toward a breakpoint that would damage family, business and public service, I don't understand the desire to be loyal to the Labor Party leader and waste my time and energy.
I'm proud to serve you and I promise that any stand-off threat or political action would stop me from believing in what I believe is the best interests of all.
Chris Lesley Natingham is a MP from the East
Ir 38-17 Melroz: The highest rise to the unexplained income
Two short attempts may reduce the difference between the final results, but there is no doubt that this day was worth winning Ayeai in the outstanding entertainment dragship match.
They are the top of the table, the only unexplained group in ten.
In the end, it was their best defense, just as well as their opportunities, which helped to win the welcome team, and the appropriate reason for their happiness was that coach Peter Murchi's.
"We have been tested so far in every game and we are still unpredictable, so I have to be happy."
Robin Christi of Melroz says: "Air has to give credit, they have made their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson’s 14th minute attempt to transform, transformed by Ferzire Clemo, however, is a yellow card by Scotland player Rory Hughes, which kicked him out of the game by Warewars to make him the majority of the game, and Jason Bagott tries to make a failure.
Just before that, at half-time time, he made it into 17-5 in a single attempt to break up.
However, Melrooz had a good start, and Patrick Anderson’s efforts were reduced to five points in a bagtock.
Then the game stopped for a long time to hit the rubber knots, who went through stretchers and went further after the start of the match with Storford Macdoval, which was transformed into Klimo.
After a serious pressure sparring, Bruce Colvin of Melroz later sentenced an extra player of Ai.
However, the welcome Ra is right back, and when Stranan Hanchinson sees yellow cards in order to deal with Klimmo without the ball, McFafson from the Penalti Line to the income mall.
Again, Kyle Rose transformed, when David had box kicks in Arstrang, and had sent Henry out to work outside the home side for the fifth time.
Still game star Ray's ready for a new career in the industry.
The steel game star Ford Kieran prepared to enter the hospital after being named as the director of a license resort company.
The 56-year-old star played a role in the popular BBC show, which he wrote himself, and has been co-hosted with the long-time joke partner, Greg Hemfel.
Both announced that the upcoming 9th series would be the last series of shows, and it seems that Kirnan is planning his life after Craig.
According to the official record list, he is the director of Andrew Fortourn Limitt.
The actor refused to comment on the issue, although the Scots San source indicated that Kirnan Glasgo's attempt to engage with "rich raspbeers" in business.
'The sea is ours': land-locked Bolivia hopes the court will open its way to the Pacific Ocean again.
The sailors are patrolling a reiging naval headquarters in La Paz.
The public buildings are opening a ocean blue flag.
From Lake Titicaca, the marines are decorated with the basics: "The sea is our right"
It's a job to recover."
The memory of the coast is still clear to Chile in a bloody conflict in the 19th century in Bolivia - just as again on the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are probably the highest in decades, because Bolivia is waiting for the International Court's verdict on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"The speed, harmony and complete spirit and of course we expect the results with positive perspective," said Roberto Callzaila, Bolivian diplomaticist.
Many Bolivian ICJ will look on the big screen throughout the country, hoping the Hague's government will go in favor of Bolivia's claim that for decades, Chile has been forced to host a sovereign outlying in the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's Caribbean President - who will face a controversial fight for the next year's reelection - has much to trust in on Monday's verdict.
"We are too close to the Pacific Ocean," he promised in the end of August.
However, some analysts believe the court does not have the chance to make decisions for Bolivia - and if so, it will not change a bit.
The Netherlands-based United Nations organization does not have the power to land Chile, and says they will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The ICJ verdict that came only after six months of the final argument indicated that the case was "not complex," said the Chilean international law expert Paz Zerte.
And in the past four years, it could be backed up again, more than ever.
"The arrival of the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Jorete said.
The anti-war speech in Moras, Chile, said:
Bolivia and Chile may continue to talk, but it will be hard to discuss later.
Two countries did not exchange ambassadors since 1961.
The Bolivian representative of The Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Vettegi, denied the unusually rapid pace of the court's decision.
On Monday, Bolivia's "an extraordinary opportunity for a new era of affairs" and "the end of 139 years of debate" along with personal benefits, said he.
Kalzadila also denied that Morales, one of the most popular Latin American presidents, is still using the issue as a political tape.
"I will never leave the right to enter the Pacific ocean," he adds.
"This is the opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says the nuclear desecration will not come until the United States believes.
North Korea's Foreign Minister R. Young Ho said that if you don't trust Washington, his nation will not destabilize its nuclear weapons first.
He left the speech on Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He called on rival leaders of the United States to follow their promise to hold a summit in Singapore.
His comments came when the United States Secretary of State Mike Pompo, along with North Korean Kim Jong Yun, was on its way to re-start a permanent nuclear diplomacy three months later.
The ree says that it is a "Pip Dream" that continues the bans and U.S. objections to the end of the Korean War will risk North Korea.
Washington cautions that Pyongyang may first agree with the announcement without having to process a significant unarmedization process.
Kim and U.S. President Donald B.C.E. wanted both the second convention.
However, there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about leaving a weapon whose country is probably the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pymp wants to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Tramp meeting.
The Paris Fashion Shows published the latest line to headware on the way to a High Street near you
If you want to raise your hat or block the sun completely, you don't need to see.
The designer Valentino and Them Brown have revealed a series of overseased heads gears to collect their S19 collection, which shocked Paris Fashion Week's style set.
This summer, very absurd hats are flooded with Instagram and the designers send Katawa to their eyes.
Valentino’s creation was one of the over-the-top biz hats that were equipped with wide-eyed feathers that covered the heads of the models.
Among other overspenders, an ornamental melon, including a wizard hat, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Som Brown has also published a choice of the strange mask - and at the right time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were similar to the Hanbal Laketer, compared with the most colorful masking and horrible fun.
A creation similar to the entire Scubba Dieving gear with Snowcel and Gogles, the other that looks like an ice cream.
And if you continue the massive fashion statement - then you are lucky.
Style watchers have predicted that the big Bonets could be on your near Hi Street.
Outseased hats are competing "La Bomba", two wide-sized straw hats that each wear to Emily Vazkovski from Rinai.
The label puts Catawa in the back of the most unreasonable cap on social media, another big one - a straw bag that is about to be swimming-stained.
The burning orange rafia bag at the S199 collection of Jackymas La Rivera, Paris Fashion Week, was one of the top white hands.
Celebrity Styleist Luke Armage Fitmail informs: "I hope that next summer big hats and beaches bags will arrive at Hi Street - as designers have had such a big impact on the Oversized Annob needs to be ignored."
Jon Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland’s independent schools have maintained a track record of academic excellence, and it continued to track another extraordinary test in 2018, which is strengthened by personal and collective success in the efforts of sports, art, music and other communities.
These schools, representing more than 30,000 students across Scotland, attempt to provide their students and parents with services at the best level of their parents, the Cherokee Council of Independent School (SCIS).
The unique schools aim to prepare their students for more and more higher education, their selection of employment and their place as global citizens.
As an educational field that can design and apply a special school textbooks, we see modern languages continue to be popular and favorite in schools.
Nelson Mandela says: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head."
If you talk to him in his own language it goes to his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that if we want to create relationships and trust with other people, we cannot rely only on English.
From the results of this year's recent experiment, we can see that the list of bests in the League tables is among the highest in the Language Unique School.
A total of 68% of the foreign language study students earned a higher grade.
The data collected from 74 members of the SCIS school shows that 72% of students received higher grades in the Mandarin, when 72% studied German studies, 69% studied French and 63% of Spanish studies.
It proves that the independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Language is now, as a topic of choice, the individual school textbooks, and elsewhere, like the EMEM topics, technology, engineering and mathematics.
According to a survey in the United Nations Commission for Epipement and Development 2014, 17% of the reasons the employers have attributed their language skills to lack.
Thus, language skills are becoming necessary to prepare young people for their career in the future.
These skills are necessary in the world for more possible opportunities.
Whoever chooses a career, if they learn the second language, they will have real benefits in the future with their living skills.
Automatically contacting people abroad puts a multicultural person before the competition.
According to Ugov, more than 4,000 adults in Yuke’s survey in 2013, 75 percent of them were not proper in any foreign language during the conversation, and the French-speaking decades-the-century was the only language, 15%.
This is why it is important for today’s children to invest in language education.
In multiple languages, especially in developing countries, there will be a better opportunity for children to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ in languages they have been taught.
Several schools will focus on a more classic modern language, while looking at 2020 others will be able to teach languages that are considered to be most important for Yuk, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be many languages to choose in independent schools, including experts.
The Cherokee Unique Schools are dedicated to providing an education environment that prepares children and prepares them with skill to succeed in whatever future.
In business environments around the world, it cannot be denied that languages play an important role in the future of the country, so it should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern language should really be considered as "internal communication skills."
The unique schools will provide this choice, diversity and source for the youth of Scotland.
It must be done.
John Edward is the director of the Cherokee Council of Independent School.

Rider Cup 2018: Team USA is fighting to keep up one Sunday's unit.
At the end of the three democratic session, Fordsam was in need of this rider cup on Saturday afternoon.
The swing of Pendulum in Momentam is a fully formed sport, but it really believes the players are the best at all.
So where are they gonna tell me?
"They had a six-point lead, and now it's four, so I think we now have a little bit of Momentum,” Jordan asked them to walk for that day.
Europe has advantages, of course, which remains to four points.
Americans, as per Spoke, feel that they have some help on their way and that they can be of great encouragement, especially from Síthe and Justin Thomas, who played all day together and took up three points.
Spith has been deadly since the beginning and has been leading from the front.
As he goes on to celebrate his round, the screams were growing stronger, as he and Tomás were behind two points after they had scored two points, and it was important to hand over the entire square match.
The Pat that won the match won in 1515 received a similar scream, much to tell you that he believes he is not from the American team.
"You really have to go deep down and think about your match," Smiteth said.
It's all there is to each of these players.
18 holes to mark a mark.
More than Simith and Thomas have had more than two days, the story of Frenchscoe Mosari and Tommy Flatwood, Rider Cup.
It's strange in Europe, but Aari has been four to four and no mistakes.
"Mollywood" was the only pair of guys who did not shoot any Boggi Saturday afternoon, but they avoided Boggi on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and Friday morning.
The run, and the way their strengths were moving towards and out of the crowd, seemed to be that they were losing on Sunday, and as long as the sun sets on the Le Golf Nationals, there was no longer any suitable way to stamp out the European victory without Fatewood or Lesari.
It's better if both are in different holes at the same time.
Although the European pride goes from time to time.
As a couple with Alex Noren, Bubba Watson and the Web Simpson Morning Hero Sergeo García had some problems.
At the first nine, a Boggi and two doubles threw Sweed in a hole where they had never been able to get up.
On Sunday, though, there's no one to get you out of your hole.
Condolences between the couple bound together, suggests that the advice they don't give and that the strategy that may be instantly changed is very interesting to watch Fourballs and Foursam from around.
Europe has played relatively well so far as a team and took an important lead on the final day, but this 4sam session also proved that there is a team of Team USA hungry for fighting, especially the Stateside.
Europe took 10-6 lead on the final day of the Rider Cup.
On Saturday's final day, Europe will take healthy benefits from 10-6 points against the United States, from its Forbeball and Forsam match on Saturday.
The couple, who were encouraged, led two tigers at Tommy Feetwood and France's Mosco Molina, to win two times against Woods at the golf National, now taking them at four points.
Tomás Jorn's European team, two years ago, is trying to restore the Trollente that lost two years ago, blowing out the corrupt American side in the morning, and winning the series at 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in Forksam, but they didn't meet the shortage.
The Jim Fulic team needed eight points from the 12 single matches on Sunday to recover the Trophysics.
Fatewood, the first European-point winner, and he and Molyari, are the second pair to score from the first four points in the history of Ridard Cups to the first four-pointed match after a cool weekend.
To crush Woods and Patrick Ride, they then put together one of the losing Woods and American Runki Brainson Decambau, who was severely sentenced to more than 5 and 4 years in prison.
On Saturday, Woods, which pulled itself out to two matches, left a brightness storm between Woods, but now he lost to 19 matches between his Forlball and Foursam's 29 matches.
Justin Rose, take rest for breakfast, return to Henryk Stonson, partner in Formsam and Brooks Cooper 2 and 1 Works in the world - one and three in the world.
A pleasant, windy day in southwestern Paris, though it wasn't on its own.
Three main winners, Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas, put the balance for Americans on Saturday with two points.
They had won 2 and 1 strong victory against Spain's Zone Ram and Yan Polter in Forsam, and returned to defeat both Polter and Rory McCarney 4 and 3.
A team, like only two times in the history of the Rider Cup, has returned from the shortage of four points, although it only needs the draw to recover it as a pro-Furdic advantage.
After two days of getting the second, however, the counter-attack on Sunday looks like it's going to get rid of them.
North Korea says without “no” belief it will not be destabilized.
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ban is deepening its disbelief in the United States and that they have no opportunity to give up nuclear weapons in a national context.
In the annual general session of the Re Young Ho World Organization, North Korea took significant action last year to stop nuclear and missile tests, to promise the nuclear testing, and to promise "not to increase nuclear technology and nuclear weapons."
"But we haven't seen similar reactions in the United States," he says.
"If there is no trust in the United States, we will have no confidence in our national security and there is no way to destabilize us in this national situation."
Although North Korea's complaint against Washington’s system of nuclearization was to describe North Korea’s slow steps, his statement was significant because he did not leave nuclear destabilization altogether, as Pyangyang did in the past.
During the first conference between the United States President and North Korea's leaders, Kim Jong Yun and Donald দো to work on “the nuclear destabilization of the Korean Peninsula” in Singapore on June 12th and when the opening guaranteeing North Korea’s protection.
North Korea is investigating the official end of the 1950-5 Korea war, but the United States says Pyongyang must first leave its nuclear weapon.
Washington has also resisted calls for ease of strict international sanctions on North Korea.
The United States also objected to the announcement of "responsibleness-first" and "responsibility" to achieve their purpose, even after the declaration of "the end of the war".
"The idea that the authorities can risk us on the ground is a worthless dream those who don't know about us.
However, the problem continues to deepen our disbelief."
Not a comment on the plan of the second summit between R.K. Kim, and trumpet, which the U.S. head of the United Nations highlighted earlier this week.
Instead of the Minister, Kim and South Korean leader Mun Ja-in mentioned three meetings in the past five months: "If the issue of abortion was not in the United States, the destabilization of South Korea wouldn't have been such a disaster."
Nevertheless, the introduction of Ree's speech was dramaticly different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that the mainland was destined to be targeted with North Korean rockets when "Mr. Evil President" was suicided by the "Kit Man".
This year in the United Nations, Removeed North Korea's "silent destruction" last year, he praised Kim for his courage to take up an unarmed move, but said that there is still a lot of work to do and that the restrictions must be maintained until North Korea is underage.
"If it takes two years, three or five months, it doesn't matter" he said on Wednesday.
China and Russia argued that Pyongyang should be rewarded for the move taken by the U.N. Protection Council
However, the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pomp also told Americans, on Thursday, the Council of Defense that "the bans of the Council of Defense must continue until we fully understand the final destabilization."
The bans on North Korea have been widely imposed on North Korea since 2006, for stopping funds at the National and Political missile program in Pyonging.
Pymp was also met by the General Assembly of the United Nations (UN) and then said that he will visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
It's already been three years since he visited North Korea, but his last visit was not good.
When she left Pyongyang in July, she said that there are some developments that have taken place, until a few hours before North Korea only condemns her for "disgusting" her!
North Korea promised to break a missile site and a nuclear complex this month if the United States adopted the "professional system".
He said that Kim was looking for him, but the safety he guaranteeed Singapore, and the security of relations with Washington was a guarantee.
Harvard students are conducting adequate rest courses.
This year, a new course at Harvard University provides voice to all his graduates to cope with rising culture of study.
One academic discovers that very basic issues about how university students will take care of themselves are often confused.
The course was created by Charles Sizila, a doctor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a female hospital expert, who believes that this is the first time in the United States.
After giving a speech about what had affected the lack of sleep, he found an inspiration to start the course.
‘ At the end of it, a girl approached me and said to me: ‘Why have I been told this all this time, my senior year?’
He said, "No one ever told him about the importance of sleeping - what surprised me, he was telling the Telegraph.
This year, for the first time, the course of the course to be started is how students are able to help better sleep - academics and anthletics Parforthmans, as well as the need to improve their general health.
Paul Barira, a medical professor at Harvard Medical School and an executive director at the University of Health, said that the university decided to launch this course after students were severely deprived of sleep this week.
One hour long course includes several related tasks.
In one section, there is a program room where students will know about the impact of coffee cups, screens, trainers and books by clicking on Caphine and lighting and how the amletic Parfors can be affected by a lack of sleep and appreciate the importance of a Bedtime routine.
In other categories, the participants are told how long-term sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer
A map of campuses, including an interactive icon, then asks participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know it won't immediately change the behavior of students
However, we believe that they have the right to know as much as you decide to smoke, but they also have the right to know the effects on health, including Professor Sizla, who adds:
He says the proud culture of staying awake is still alive, and he adds that the growing pressure on modern technology and students is a growing problem.
To ensure that you have sufficient good sleep, Snares should be a student's 'Secret arms' to fight discouragement and anxiety, he says, even making sleepless brain hungry, constantly hungry."
Raymond Soe, 19, a 19-year-old student in California's chemical and physical science studies, was able to design the course of Professor Sizila, who has also taken a class in Harvard for his first year last year.
He said that the course opened its eyes and inspired him to be a campus-wide course.
In the next step, he hopes that all graduates will be asked to complete a study program before participating in competitive institutions.
Professor Sizila suggested that students should consider the preparation of a alarm for when to go to bed and when to wake up and that they should be aware of the harmful effects of "a blue light" that destroyed your Sardiqian rhythms, causing problems to go to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: The Magar Gord's defeat.
Rangers saw defeat in yet another Away match, due to Stephen Jerd's beat down to Livingston.
After the victory of St. Johnston’s 4-1 victory in February, Ibrox's team looked forward to another victory, but Gary Hort's team presented Jord's second defeat as manager in 18 matches, which led him to eight points of heart at the Ledbro's top.
Seven minutes before half-time, Menga was hit, but hopeless Rangers lined up never made their talk.
Rangers are down below the sixth point, Livingston is back in third place and the difference between Hebernyan is behind.
And the Rangers may have other problems because the linesman Kelsam Spains had to be treated for his head wound.
The Jorard has changed eight changes that have led to the semi-arted cup semifinals.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11 that took a point from the heart last week and was proud to be the way her team had beaten up the opponent.
Rangers may have control over the force, but Livingston has done more with their ball.
Mengar was the first to send Scott Pitman to the Le-of-Alan McGregor's goal in just two minutes, but the Midfieldr lost his chance.
Kghan Jacobs found kreg Haqt, a long Freekirk captain, but his defense partner Alan Lithgo was able to beat the ball in the back post.
Rangers restored control, however, they were more likely to believe in their finals.
Alfred Morelos must have felt that he and Stephen Loes should have found his penality in the quarter-war, but the President Steven Thompson rejected the Colombian appeal.
Rangers can only target two shots, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Loam Kesana Kulbali was in little trouble with head of head of Ovi Ezeri.
Livi's 34th minute opening goal may have been against the current wave, but no one can deny that they are the only ones to play it.
Once again, Rangers Jacobs failed to handle the Dip set.
Scott Rfield did not react that Decan Gala had made a ball slot on the island's Gala.
Jorard took a break to replace Ryan Kent and the change was nearly immediately working as Weingty Morlos was in, but the great Kelly was off the line.
However, the game that the Livingston enjoys was the same, the Lithgo and Hakot were reading long after saying a long term.
Holt's team could have taken their Leeds to the last stage, but standing standing up to destroy MacGregor Jacobs' efforts before he was heads from the Lithgo corner.
The Ranger's subtitling for Let Pentality's subtitent, as soon as they stumble with Jacobs, has turned back, calling for Glen Middleton's claim.
Almanac: Ginger counter explorer.
And now we have a page of "Sanday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago from today... on the day that physics scientist Johanes Wilhelm was born in Germany in the future.
Ginger developed a system to identify and measure the radiation, a discovery that eventually became known as the Gaga counter.
This post is part of our special coverage Languages and the Internet.
Human: "What is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Ginger counter, also used to identify radioactive minerals such as Urium."
When you give these Yarphone brides, you can hear the effects of radiation within the minerals."
Evans: "What do you say?"
"Hance" Gaigar died in 1945 shortly before his 63th birthday.
But the discovery of his name remains alive.
The vaccine for new cancer can teach the Emeoun system to identify corrupt cells.
The vaccine for new cancer can teach me to identify and kill the corrupt cells.
The Vacine teaches me to identify pouncies as part of the treatment system.
The method includes identifying the immune cells from patients and changing them in the lab.
Then they can "see" a simple protein for many cancers and then reentered.
A test Vacine showed positive results with patients from different levels of cancer.
Vacinety is a medical woman who teaches the Imoun system to identify corrupt cells, the cancer of her Dembascoma has disappeared for more than 18 months.
In the system, they are able to retrieve preventable cells from patients, change them in experiments so that they can "see" many simple proteins of HER2, and then rerogate them.
“Our results show that we have very much hope Vacine,” says J.B. Bourfsky, professor of the U.S. National Cancer Institute at Bethesda, England.
HER2 explains: "Breast, Dambasy, lung and cologne cancer, including Professor Barzfsky.

Kanye West SNL's Pro-Tramp debate wears a MAGA hat
It wasn't good.
Kanye West was placed in the studio after a "Smite Night" Live in which she praised the President of the United States's Donald দো that she will be on her own in 2020.
After performing his third night song, Ghost Town, where he was wearing a Meke U.S. Great Cap, he condemned the Democrats and restored his support for the hanging.
"Many times when I talk to a white man, they say: "How can you choose to be racist!"
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left the US long ago," he said.
The show was launched by a SNL Mat daemon-provided show where the Hollywood star, Christine Blazzy Ford, laughed at the witness on the Senate's Judicial Committee to demand sexual abuse.
Although it was not broadcast, the video footage of West's irony was uploaded by the satirist Chris Rock on social media.
It is not clear if you tried to mock West with the rock post.
Moreover, he complained to the West audience that he had to face problems in his head too.
"They made me Backstze Galal.
They said, 'Don't go out with the hat'
They've given me a bad name!
And then they said that I was in a drowning place, according to Washington Examiner.
West continues: "Do you want to see the place?" He says that he “can read Superman Cape, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Then try with love."
His comments were placed at least two times in the audience and the SNL customers felt embarrassed, reported Vayra, where a person informed the publication: "The whole studio had a pinlet's silence."
The singer was brought to West as an alternative to the Archana Grand whose ex-boyfriends, Mac Miller, died a while ago.
West I love it, as if it's a little bit like a pier bottle in the performance.
West conservative group TPUSA has received support from Kandas Turner, who tweets: "Thanks to one of the bravest spirits: you for standing up against the perpetrators."
However, Talksho host Karen Hunter tweeted that West "it was what she was and that she was extremely cool."
"But I prefer not to buy or do anyone (his music or style or his" art) who embraces and spread bad standards for my community.
He's free.
And so we," he added.
Before the show, the employer announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he is now "known as the West".
D is not the first artist to rename his name and follow the path of DD, known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and PD.
Another contemporary figure, Sonup dog, was named Sonoupón, and of course the late Music Prince, changed his name to an icon previously known as the Prince.

The game of the Thrones star Kite Harington attacked Toxic Matsculinity.
Kit Harington is known for its aggressive role as a Zone Snow in the aggressive Middle Ages series of Middle Ages.
However, the 31-year-old actor, Macho, spoke of the play style of the hero, which means the national role on the screen is the idea of young boys to be so strict in their respect.
Speaking to the Sunday Times while talking to culture, Kit said that he believed that something had gone wrong and asked how he could handle the problem #MeToToo age
Kit, who recently married Rose Leskey at 31 years of age, admits that he feels strong about the problem.
“I personally, very strong, at the moment – where are we wrong in maleity?” he said.
'What did we teach them when men were growing up that we are facing now?'
Kit believes that television toxic should be partly responsible for the growth of Masculin, for its highly male characters.
He adds: "What are we, and what are we learning?
What is taught on TV and on the street that boys seem to be to be men to follow this specific path?
I think it's really one of the biggest questions of this period - how do we change it?
Because some of the young men have been in error ,
In the interview, he also admitted that when the series is fresh in the next summer, he won't be playing the game of the Thrones Polrical, he said he ended his life "warships and horses".

HIV/ AIDS: China has released 14% growth in new spaces.
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of HIV and AIDS victims.
There are more than 8,000 affected people in the country, says health officers.
More than 40,000 new incidents were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases were transmitted by sexually transmitted cases, which have been changed in the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection has spread to different parts of China to the extent that it can be transmitted.
However, the number of HIV infected people on the way has been near zero, as Chinese health officers said at a conference in Yunan province.
However, there are more than 100,000 living in China every year, including HIV and AIDS.
HIV transmission is a serious problem with the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people was considered to be a fact.
According to the country's conservative values, research suggests that 70-90% of men commit sex with men, later married women.
A lot of infection comes from inadequate sexual protections in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV as part of its effort to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters GOP denies the information of senators, “spoilious lies” and “colonial theories”
On Saturday, the United States, Republican Maxine Waters denied the charges that one member of his staff posted personal information to US Republican senators on Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democratic firmly claimed that these demands are being circulated by "Altra-Right Wings" scholars and websites.
"false, false, and more hateful lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The data includes the address and phone number of senators in the United States, Senator Linds Lyndes Graham in South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orin Harch, both at Utter.
The information was released online on Thursday, and an anonymous person posted the hearing of the Senate panel hearing on charges of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court candidate, the Supreme Court's chosen candidate.
The leak came shortly after the three Senators asked Kavana.
Arguing scholar and conservative sites such as Red State report that the post's source IP address was linked to the "Watters" office and that Hill reported a member of the Waters staff.
"This nonsense is a lie and a perfect lie," continues Waters.
"My staff members - whose identity, personal information and protection have been resolved by fraud and false accusations - were in no way responsible for the leaks.
"The accusations are all wrong and a perfect lie."
Water's statement was quickly criticized by many online netizens by the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fishr.
"This denial is angry," wrote Filisha.
"It says that he has no tendency to be a member of Congress.
Don't be angry when someone is accused of not doing what they did.
They must not be a defendant.
They must not question the motives of the accused.
They must be calm and pure."
The critics of the Waters were comparing the Democratic Republic's reaction to the judge, Kavana, who was being criticized for being very angry by the critics on Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is also in the runoff of Waters in the mid-election, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's big," he tweets.
In his statement, Waters said that his office warned "the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies" about the fraud claims.
"We will make sure that the criminals will be released," he continued, "and will be legally held accountable for any member of my staff and all members of the organization, and all they have to do."
Johnny English Straks Agein Review - Wet-Aitkins Explosive
This is traditional to see the significance of any new picture, including British Antiquities, and it seems that Johnny English action-commitd Spuff has been due to the referendum - which began in 2003 by Johnny English and was back in English life by Johnny English.
Will we clearly have a new chance of a waste nation?
In any rate, pop-eyed, rubber-sized Johnny English has a second license to create new things – rather than anything else, the name suggests that it is designed for a wide comic, designed for a world without English.
He must have contributed to a note at the Sharits of Fire Theme Tort in London in 2012.
He was mainly based on Traver, and the international mystery was once performed by Baraklecards, which spread chaos in the heart.
This is the last time you have two great moments out there.
I'd like to see Johnny English come close to a helicopter when the Rita blades were hanging with a little helmet in the Middle Ages.
Astokinson's gift for physical humor shows, however, the joke has been felt very low and ridiculously, especially as the "Syrias" film brand is now making fun of it with confidence.
The joke seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and to me, the strange accidents in Johnny English are not as innovative and central as the silentest of the bin's personality, Atkinson's joke.
A multi-cultural basis is the Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker broke into a very secret web network in Britain, in order to expose the identity of all British agents, to the frustrated agent in the field, and, unfortunately, a small role in Kevin Andlon.
This is the last hope of a Prime Minister who is already suffering from a complete recession of political dissent, he is eccentric and close personality: Emma Thompson has performed this semi-tresa-me character but there is little to work in the script.
His intelligence counselors told him that every active spy had been negotiated, so he had to get out of his retirement.
And this means to shut up Johnny English, who is now a school teacher in some Western institutions, but does not teach him how to become a covert: there are some good jokes, since English is offering the rock-type Academy school here.
He returned to the English Whitebox for emergency Brining and again met Ben Miller with his former long-term side-key side.
The Bau is now married to a sub-king commander, a Jolly-Haki-stick, which has been somewhat wasted by Vicky Paperdin.
So, the Batman back to his office and Robin had to face the words Olega Kurenenko's prerogatory woman, Ofja Kurenenko.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Carishomics has become a dangerous target in the spells of Brewer, who claims that he can solve the problems in Britain: Jack Lesie, the alleged criminal, Jason Volita.
English and Bau started their ridiculously high-sixing sound: they set fire on a flash French restaurant; they smuggled themselves into the luxury boat; and in order to try to get to know themselves inside the English veterinary house.
All the stops are definitely moving for the final sequence, but as much as they were of Mayan and Zeral, the whole thing has a bit of kids' TV.
Very medium stuff.
And like other Johnny English movies, I couldn't imagine that: can't give the British film industry a role that really does justice for his talent?
Labor denied that it was planning to work for Briton for four days a week, but only for five days.
Jeremy Corbin's Labor Party will consider a key plan that Britishs will work four days a week - but get paid for five days a day.
The group wants its owners to share the money with an extra day-off saving of workers through artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.
It is a three-day holiday of employees to enjoy employees - but the wages will still be the same.
Sources say that the idea with the party's economic program is to be "flot" and plans to remove the country for workers.
Trade Union Congress has allowed it to be transferred in a four-day week as a way for the workers to take advantage of the changes to the economy.
A senior source of Labor Party told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
This is not going to happen overnight but is a four-day wish that the team adapts to its system of balance in favor of the overall industry of the party.
The first nine Labor Party in favor of supporting this national idea promised to do so in four days during its general election campaign in 2017.
The desire is currently not supported by the Labor Party, though.
A spokesman for Labor Party said: "A four-day working party is not a policy and it is not considered by the party."
The Sado Chancellor John McCedel used last week's Labor Conference to express his views for a Socialist Revolution in the economy.
Mr. MacDonnell says he is determined to turn power back from "unidentified directors" and "lovers".
The current shareholders of water companies can get back their entire part because the labor government can 'adversize' something for wrong actions.
He also confirmed the plan to keep 10 per cent of the private sector employees on board and raise ownership funds, with an annual budget of $500 per cent.
Lindsay Graham, tell John Kennedy to "60 minutes" that Kavana's FBI investigation can change their mind.
The judge has postponed his final vote in the Supreme Court for at least a week in regard to the charges against the FBI regarding the FBI investigation, and questioned whether the Bureau's investigations could turn the Republican senator back in their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, Scott Peloli asked Republican senators whether John Kennedy and Lindsaying the FBI could discover something that moved them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague in South Carolina.
"You mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I told you to go to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavana.
I called him later, the complaint came out, said, "Did you do this?"
He was determined, unforgettable."
The vote, of course, seems unchangeable.
"My mind has been created about Bavana and there will be a big need to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Bresten has strongly refused," adds Christine Blassi Ford, referring to him.
"And they can't verify what his name says.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see any change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and does it do to reduce poverty?
This Saturday will be the Global Citizen Festival in New York, an annual music event that has a great line of celebrities and an equally impressive mission; the end of world poverty.
Now in the seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will raise awareness on the real goal of the event, not only with thousands of people visiting Central Park in order to enjoy the Acts like Janet Jackson, cardi B and Sean Mendez, but also to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The 2012 Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the global poverty project, a group that actively promotes the number of people fighting internationally, hoping for poverty to end.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you don't want to pay for VIP ticket), the concerters had to do a lot of work, e-mail a volunteer, an e-mail, a global phone call, or an end to any other poverty.
However, how much did Global Citizen succeed in reaching his goal for 12 years?
Or another case of so-called "Climateism" - where people think they are signing online appeal or sending a tweet in a real way?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from supporters, moving towards goals.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders declare the world's leaders the most commitment and policies that will affect the lives of 2.22 billion people by 2030.
Earlier in 2018, the group quoted 390 promises and declarations that began from its actions, including at least 10 billion dollars already collected.
The group speculates that safe funds have been directly affected by approximately 649 million people around the world.
Some of the original promises are the Power of Newtrations, United Kingdom-based investors and implements the partnership to "provide their full potential", and to end the 35 million supplies to the province after receiving more than 4,700 tweets.
"With the support of the UK government like you, donors, national government, and Global citizens, we can turn the social injustice into a matter of history," the ambassador of the Power of Newtree, Justin 2018, told the public during a power concert in London.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 steps were taken in the United States to improve the nourishment of mothers and children, the government announced that the power of innovation, which will reach 5 million women and children in the midst of nourishment intervention.
In response to a often askeded question on its website, "What do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen answered: "It will be a long and hard path - sometimes we will fall and fail."
However, like the great civil rights and anti-racism movement in front of us, we will succeed because we are together stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weekd, Sean Mendès, cardi B, Genil Mony, will be among those who perform this year's performance in New York, which will be run at Debra-Lee Fares and Hugoman.
U.S. could use the Navy to "responsible" the energy spill to US Russia.
Washington can take refuge with the Navy to prevent Russian fuels from coming to the Middle East countries, as described by Washington's Secretary of Internal Affairs Ryan Zinc.
Zinc complains that Russia is involved in a number of ways in Syria, in which it is being invited by the legal government, an excuse to visit the new fuel market.
"I believe that the reason for their stay in the Middle East is that they want to split power lines like East Europe, South European," he said.
And according to the officials, there is a way to take action and act.
"If the US has the power to keep the sea open with our navals, and if it is necessary, then they are blocking their fuel to ensure that they don't go to the market."
In Zink, a non-profit group that identifies "the voice of the clients" in the United States, was speaking to participants at the event organized by the Teumar Energy Alliance.
He was comparing Russia and Iran to Washington's use of it, referring to the same reality.
"The cards, including the fossil fuel-based economy in Russia, are "the benefit and replacement of Iran and Russia's financial alternative," he said.
These statements were made during the cheapest form of natural gas export for European consumers in Europe instead of Russia.
The effects of this led to the efforts of U.S. President Donald _BAR_ United States President Donald _BAR_ "inappropriate" Germany from the National Stream 2 Pipe Project, which is in the hands of Berlin Moscow, according to The Economist."
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion US dollar - Nod Stream 2 pipeline, which doubles the power of existing pipelines, is completely a financial project.
The Kremlin argues that the project is nothing more than strong opposition for Washington, and that it is an example of an inconsequential competition.
"In my faith, we agree that energy pressure can't be used as a tool and should have the ability to choose customers," said Alexander Novak, Minister of Energy for Russia, after interviews with U.S. Energy Minister Ric Perpe in Moscow.
As a result of the United States' position, Germany won a negative reaction from the U.S., confirming its commitment to the Germany Project.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI) told the United States of Germany to stay away from the European Union's fuel policy and the bribic agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"After the recent meeting between German Chancellor Angel Markel and Russia's president Vladimir Putin, Ditter Kampf, who is head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), told us that we had serious problems with a third state supply.
Elizabeth Warren will find a "floating" in the candidates for the 2020 President," said the Senator of Massachusetts.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that he would "see" his post for president after the election."
Warren confirmed that he was in agreement at a town in Holykek.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix our damaged government and lead women to top positions," he said.
"After 6 November, I will be firmly grounded for president."
Warren Town, during his time in the hall, expressed his opposition against the righteous, saying that the trumpet "is leading the country in the wrong direction."
"I am very concerned about what you're doing to our democracy," he says.
Warren was outraged with the criticism of the Supreme Court-elect, Bhanawagh, and the Supreme Court of the trumpets.
Warren said in a Friday tweet, "Of course we need the FBI investigation before voting."
According to a study published on Thursday, most of Warren's voters do not think he should win the elections in 2020.
According to the political research center of Safak University / Boston Globes, the "sacre" registered voters in Massachusetts say they shouldn't compete with senators.
A total of 35% support the battle.
According to a study, the former governor Deval Patrick's vote was more supportive of the contest, while 38% supported the possible struggle and did not 48%.
Other potential high profile developments in the 2020 vote include former vice president Joe Byden and Edward Sanders of Vermont.
Assosed Press reports, Baiden has announced that it will officially decide between January and January.
Sara Palin quoted PTSD of the tracks at the protest in Donald Ford
Track Palin, a 26-year-old, spent a year in Iraq in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged for internal violence.
"He told the audience at a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, to come back to what my own son was going through, I understood the consequences of those other families who took the PTSD and our soldiers to flight."
Palin called his arrest "the wild elephant" and told his sons and other warmakers that "they came back to change a bit, they came back strong, thinking they came back to think that the military and military forces and other members of the army had a respect for what they had given their colleagues."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasila, Alaska, and according to Dan Benet, an officer from the police department, he was accused of having family violence, arms and drug addicts.
18 States supports the challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and District of Colombia are supporting the legal challenge against the new US policy that refused to provide shelter for the victims who escaped gangs or family violence.
NBC News reported that in order to support a asylum that is challenging the policy, representatives from 18 states and District District have filed a friend-in-law at the court in Washington on Friday.
The full name of Grace V. Sessions case, which was filed in August against the federal policy of the U.S. Civil Liberty Union, was not released.
He said his companion "and his violent gang members" called him a curse, but U.S. officials refused his request for asylum on July 20.
He was detained in Texas.
The attorneys in the state of Grace give examples of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, as a country facing widespread gangs and domestic violence, with a large number of petitions for asylum in the United States.
The new U.S. asylum policy decided to reverse the 2014 appeal board which allowed migrants who fled to seek refuge for domestic violence.
The Attorney General of the Columbi, in a Friday statement, Carl Resin, said that the new policy "has ignored federal and international laws in a multitude of decades."
Friend-in-law Bref says that "the appeal of all refugees to this federal law should be judged according to specific information and circumstances and violate its national ban on basic motives."
In the statement, attorneys also argued that the United States has been hurting the US economy because they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and provide "needless labor".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration judges to stop the victims of family violence and gang escape from violence in June.
“The persecution of those who have left their own country can be given shelter because of the membership of the nation, religion, nationality, or political opinion in certain social groups,” the session declared its policy on June 11.
The solution to all problems of asylum - even all the deadly problems that people face every day of their lifetime.
The death toll will be twice and desperate to rescue the living
Things were getting worse for survivors.
"The 35-year-old Resa Kusuma, who lives in the shelter of Palu City, asked her to comfort him with a fever," that was very worried."
"Each minute an ambulance is dying.
We can't get clear water."
The residents have returned to their homes to try to find anything found in the water that can be found.
Hundreds of people are flooded with injuries and 7.5 magnitude tremors.
Some of the injured people, including Dui Harris, have been kept outside the army hospital, due to strong tremors on their back and shoulder, are being treated under the sky.
She cried to tell her how she felt when she was in the 5 store room with her wife and daughter.
"I don't have any time to save myself.
I was stuck in a broken wall, I guess," news correspondent Harris added that they came to the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, then silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my kids.
I hope they're safe."
American Ambassador accuses China of "Progagading"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in the U.S. Daily, China's ambassador accused the U.S. press of using the US press to promote propaganda against Beijing.
U. S. President Donald face-to-date with the U.S. Congress's plan to intervene in China's US Congress last Wednesday, as President Donald face charges that China is the largest Chinese daily newspaper in Iowa on November 6.
The trumpet accused him of attempting to interfere with Beijing’s US elections, which US officials called Reuters a new attempt to pressure China.
It is natural that the foreign government will give a commercial to promote trade, but Beijing and Washington are currently under trade war so that they will increase the amount of trade in each other's imports.
Chinese and U.S. experts said that in the early part of the trade war, Chinese backers, like Iowa, were created to harm Raffniators in the state, who supported the Republican Party in the country.
The former long-term governor of China's U.S. Ambassador and Irmi, Teri Brantad, who is a big cooker in agricultural products in China, said Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers and businessmen.
Branstrad writes in a post on Sunday’s Desminus Registers that China "has doubleed the brutality with the intentional advertising of our own free press."
Branstrad writes, "The Chinese government is taking the immoral advantage of history in the history of American freedom of speech and free press with a promotion of money on Dees mines register."
“On the other hand, you will find limited opposition voices on the streets of Beijing and you will not see the real reflection of China's worrying economic ways, because the news media here is in the hands of the Communist Party of China.”
He also said that his article "China's refusal to have a major newspaper print", even though he did not mention the newspaper's name.
Republicans want to keep the female voters away from the Kavanf debate, warning analysts
In the face of multiple charges of sexual abuse by the Supreme Court, Nininjan Kavanf, the Supreme Court, stood up and hid by analysts, warned that they will see their congested reactions in the upcoming Midpoint elections, especially women.
The sentiment has increased in the surrounding areas and most Republicans are already openly trying to move on with the vote.
In an article published on Saturday in SiraQuuz University, the political science professor of Maxwell School said to Roma the Hill, "They can't come back."
RMother said that the pressure on Senator Jeff Froc (R-Arozona) will calm the angry voters down during the last moment for the FBI investigation is suspicious.
“Don’t forget what happened during the past year – they won’t forget it tomorrow and November," said Carin Zen- still, senior advisor of progressive moving class and National Women's Spokesperson.
Despite Dr. Christine Blaz Ford's testimony, protesters "nveb is coming" during Friday morning's morning when the judicial committee's decision to regulate Kavanf's nomination said "the protesters were coming to the hall of the Senate!"
"The independent political analyst, Sutu Rothenburg, told the news site, "the past will be democratic inspiration and inspiration."
"LK tells him there's too much already; that's true.
However, it may be more than that, especially among female voters in downtown, and among the 229-year-old voters from 18 to 209, who often do not vote for the president because they don't like him."
Even before Ford's public testimony on the charges of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court’s chosen candidate, analysts have suggested that the Republicans might have had their own objections if they proceed with the approval of the Supreme Court.
"It has become a complex issue for GeP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee earlier this week.
"It's not only about the committee's voting or the final vote, but also how Republicans have taken this issue and treated it", nearitish U.S. group that supports the Democrats who vote in the vote told Gaisil News Channel.
However, the Americans seemed to be a bit confused about who to believe in the testimony of Fords and Kavanf, which has been strong towards the latter.
A new survey in Yugov found that 41% of respondents believed in the testimony of Ford, where 35% said they must or perhaps trust Kavanf.
In addition, 38% said they thought Kavanf was probably lying during his testimony, and only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following the pressure, the FBI are currently investigating the charges against Débora Ramirez, the Guardian's report.
Ford has sworn in last week before the Judiciary Committee of Justice, who testified that Kavanf had abused him in his late 17s.
Ramírez alleged that the Supreme Court had shown himself to be at a party during Yele's studies in the '80s'.
With Google and Facebook, Google plans to launch a new Internet production by the World Wide Web.
Tim Berners-Lee of World Wide Web is launching a launch to challenge Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of the tech legend, The Int, a company that will create Berners-Lead platform in Lee.
Solid users allow people to choose where their data will be stored and to choose which data they will have access to.
In an exclusive interview with the First Company, Berners-Lee jokes that The Independent's real purpose is “the ruler of the world”.
"We have to do this now," he says about startups.
"It's a historic moment."
The app allows everyone to create P or D or "Personal Data Stores".
This could include contact list, to-do list, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsftout, Sluct and Stiffy all the same browsers and at the same time.
Unique about the personal online data store is that it will fully rely on the user - who can access information in any form.
The company called it "a personal power through the deck."
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the Institute's ideas will help bring resources, processes, and perfect skills to all get the help of Thep.
The organization is currently composed of a security platform purchased by Bernis-Lee, Bruce, an IBM, and a group of non-established developers and volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to use the tools available on the website of Insight to create their own decentralized applications.
Berners-Lee says whether he and his team will introduce a complete change to Facebook and Google where models of all their businesses will be completely changed overnight"
"We ask no permission from them."
Berners-Lee writes in a post published on Saturday that "the purpose is to provide commercial energy and a solution to the new web integrity and quality made by The Irrawaddy" on its website.
In 1946, Berners-Le Meschussets founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Institute of Technology, and made a radical change in the Internet.
In the past few months, Berners-Lee has raised a strong voice in the debate on the net neutrality.
Even so, the Berners-Lee World will be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation, and Open Data Institute.
"I am simply optimistic about the future of the web," Bernard-Lee adds.
Bernard van: The Victoria Cross celebration of the First Biscal War
A hundred years ago, the Church of England was the only priest who won Victoria Cross during World War I.
Lieutenant Colonel The Revend Bernard van won the award during the attack on Belenglis and Lehcott on September 22, 1818.
However, he was killed four days later by a assassin and he never knew he had the highest British military status.
On Saturday, two of his grandsons revealed his monument to a rally in Russian, Northamponshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said that it was "a "very significant" that the monument was revealed just a hundred years after his grandfather's appointment.
According to London Chronicles, on September 22, 1818, the Lieutenant Colonel van “led his coup through a massive shooting in the worst haze and field and machinegan,” during D. Cent-Qantine Canal.
He then rushed to the firing line and led the line with "the greatest bravery" just with a field song and threw out three enemies.
Lieutenant Colonel van was killed by a German assassin on October 4, 1818 - just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 7, said that his grandfather's work "was something I couldn't do and that was so respected."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, put blossoms after the parade, led by the Brotwood Imperial Youth band.
Michael Van says he "I'm very honored with part of the room" and adds, "A real hero is being displayed in support of the military."
M. E. E. E. E. E.E. was awake all night to see the 206 belltons, but instead they found Pepa Pig.
Imagine that you woke up all night to see a great Bell 206 and that was not the main event.
The bill's original card from San José had 13 fights, including six, and Channel 5 was live in the United States all night.
At around 6am, when Gegard Musssi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, the coverage shocked the audience of the UK.
In particular, they stayed awake until dawn, so some people were angry.
On Twitter, a woman who changed the cartoon of a curious child is described as "a sort of dirty joke."
"They were forced to change children's cartoons because they were not shown at 6am according to the rules," said Bellato's senior fellow developer, Slatterj.
"Puppa the Pig," Yes."
The president of Bellato's organization, Scott Coca, said that the future will work to create a schedule for viewers of the UK.
"We'll probably be able to solve it during the Mount," says coca.
"But we can't do this until Monday morning and Sunday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, there were lots of messages and they weren't very friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was some technical mistake.
But no, it was a government matter.
I promise you this won't happen next time.
We'll reduce it to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - it's the wrong thing in trying to give more fans more.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Disks: Tom Deley suffered from "inhumanity" because of sex.
Olympic Diver Tom Deley says he suffered from depunity when growing up - but it inspired him success.
The 24-year-old said that he did not go to secondary school before he realized that "all are not like me."
Lauren Loven, the first radio presenter to speak out on the 4 Desert Island Disk, said that she spoke about the rights of others to "hope" for gay rights.
He also said that concerns over his Olympic win after the birth of a child have decreased.
The regular event host Christy Young has spent several months off because of his illness.
Being disfellowshipped at Lavan's first ceremony, Delie said that she felt "a little" more than the rest, because it was not socially acceptable to them.
He says: "As of today, it has remained real and to feel different, which gave me strength and strength to achieve success."
He said he wanted to prove himself to be "some" so that when everyone knows about his sexuality, everyone will be disappointed.
The bronze medal won two times, the high profile became LGBT preachers, and has taken his presence in Australia to appeal to more countries to recognize homosexuality.
He says he opened his mouth because he found himself lucky to live without difficulties and wanted to "hope".
These three days, the world champion talked about falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lasan black, who met him in 2013 - "I was surprised."
Dely married the Oscar winner last year, who was 20 years old, who said that age was not a problem.
"When you're so young," she first went to the Olympics at age 14 and her father died of cancer after three years - she says that it was hard to find someone of an age who had seen so much in life.
This couple, in June, gave birth to Robert Ray Black-delly, and Deley said that his "soul" has changed.
He said, "If I had asked last year, I would say, ‘I have to win a gold medal’.
In fact, there are something much bigger than the Olympic gold medal.
"My Olympic gold medal"
His son's name is Robert, who was affected by brain cancer, died at the age of 40 in 2011.
Deley says that her father never admitted that he was going to die and finally asked if their tickets were confirmed for London 2012 - because he wanted to stay in the first row.
"I never could say, 'You won't be there to sit in the first row,' he said.
"I took his hand off his breath and died until he finally died and I did not admit that he was unimposed," he said.
Next year, Deley attended the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
He says, "This was my whole life dream - Dived in front of my audience in the Olympics, it doesn't matter"
It also inspired the choice of his first song - Prawood of Heather Small, which was balked with him in preparation for the Olympics, and which was still in shock.

Mikelson, who is in the publication, sits on the bench on Saturday's Rider Cup.
American Phil Michaelson will build a record on Sunday when his 47th Rider cup matches, but if it's not, he'll have to go back to his form if he doesn't want it to be a milestone.
Mikelson, who was playing on the record 12 times, had to sit on a bench instead of Saturday's Fourball and Forsam.
Instead of being at the center of a bluff, which he lived in a game in the United States, these 5 times major winners have been working for Cherlyder and trying to fix his game in range.
The 48-year-old leoof Nationals is not suitable for the course where Raph often gets long shots.
And if the course isn't enough for itself, Mikelson, in the match number 9, the British open champion, François Molinary, has won four matches this week.
If Americans, who have four points at the beginning of the 12 Singles match, can start well, Mikelson's match may be important.
Freak's confidence in him, though there's not much to say.
"He has fully understood today, with his arm on my shoulder and he says he's ready for tomorrow."
"He has great confidence in himself.
He is Amer, and he's given a lot to this team in the past and this week.
I didn't imagine he'd play two matches.
I was more hoping, but this happened, and that's how we thought about moving.
He wants to land, like everyone else."
On Sunday's match, Mikelson goes beyond the record of top Rider's match.
This can end at Rider Cup careers which cannot be loaned to his personal record.
18 wins, 20 har, and seven half, though, says her presence builds up the team.
"He's a funny guy, Amoudé, intelligent, loving to be a guy in a team room," he said.
"I think the new players have enjoyed playing with him too this week, which they like.
He only gives much more than a game."
Europe Captain Thomas Gonhorn knows that big lead could disappear too.
Thomas Golhorn, European Captain, knows from his experience that on the last day of the Ringer Cup, it could be uncomfortable if it was the last day of Rider's lead.
In the 197th century in Valdarama, where the party led by Savi Balesteros won five points to the Americans, but only through the narrowest margin, 14111 won the 1241.
"You make yourself think of yourself as our main lead in Valderma; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost our lead, and Valderama, where we won, but it was only a distance," Elnhorn said.
History shows me and the team that it's not over yet.
Full spirit tomorrow.
Get to the field and do the right thing.
Not until we get the points on the board.
We have a goal, that's an attempt to win the Trophy, and that gives us a bird's eye.
I have always said that I look at 12 players in my team, but we are very aware of who else we are - the best player in the world."
Jann continues, "I'm glad I'll never believe in what our players have done with the hard-working course."
There's a different fight tomorrow.
Tomorrow, the private Partners will come forward, and this is a different thing.
It's great to be with partner when it's all good, but when you're alone on the field, you're tested with your power as a golffer.
This message needs to be reached all players, who should be the best tomorrow.
Now, your partner must leave it and bring it better."
Unlike Gonhorn, the opponent will keep an eye on Jim Fryrick, which was personally played as a team, while Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas, have produced three points between four points.
Freak also experienced both the dramatic Pott-change experience as part of the "Miracles" that took place in Europe during the last days as part of the winning team in the "Miracles" and Brooklyn.
On the last day of the 199th century, he asked how Captain Ben Cranes had promoted his team, "I remember every word."
"We have 12 important matches, but you want to get out of here as fast as Brooklyn and Medina.
When the game falls on the side, there is a lot of pressure in the middle.
We'll build up line-up and name the boys as we think, but we're going to do some magic tomorrow."
Paul Kessie, Justin Rose, John Frei, Tommy Feetwood, and Jan Pulter are under the responsibility of leading Thomas against Europeans, in the opening match, to face Rory McLeller.
"This is how I put this group in this way, because in my opinion it will cover everything," Jann said of his election.
The new German warship is suspended again.
Local news reports say that the group, which was supposed to be the newest group of German Navy to replace the previous cold warships, would not have been due to poor system and snowballing costs until next year.
According to the military spokesman, Die Zit, the new Baden-Wartemberg-Creator's first ship, has been suspended for the first half of the 201 “Rainland-Filz” launched.
The ship was supposed to be involved in the Navy in 2014, but this ambitious project is in trouble with the next delivery problem.
The four Batden-Wurthmberg-class ships that were ordered by the Navy in 2007 will take place in the old Bremen-Klass-Kergeet.
It is reported that they will have strong cannons, anti-Airkraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some steel technology, such as Reused Radar, Id, and Indigenous Segenerture.
Other important features include long-term maintenance period - new freegates will be possible for two years away from the port of the country.
However, the continued delaying money is the high-level warships that Germany will be supposed to help with energy abroad - it will be old in water, Die Zitt's news.
Unfortunately, F125 Freegates last year came under the headline, when the German Navy refused to launch the formalized ship, and sent it back to the Bluem and Vosshipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time that a ship has been sent back to the shipbie after the Navy delivered it.
Little has been known about the reasons behind the return, but German media mentioned several important "software and hardware error" that would make the ship useless in battle.
The software is especially important, since the Bden-Wurramberg-class ships will be run by about 120 crews - half of the crowdables of the old Bronmen's freegates.
Furthermore, it was apparent that the ship was too heavy to reduce its performance and preventing others from adding the future of the Navy.
These 7,000 tons of "Rinland-Flitz" are considered as twice heavy than the same ship used by Germans during World War II.
Aside from poor hardware, the cost of the whole project, including training crews, is becoming a problem.
The initial level received $3.6 billion (US$3.6 billion) from billions.
In a recent context of the German Navy's collapse, new helicopters with problems have become more important.
Earlier this year, Hans-Patter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defense Committee, admitted that "Moten's ships are running out of the Navy."
The official said that the problem was over at the time, as none of the old ships that were cancelled had been carried out.
He was sad that neither Bden-Wartramberg's ships were able to join the Navy.
Getting access to the National Trust in Bader's Life
New research is being carried out in a University of the Cherokee Mountains to find out how to use the land in search of food.
Hopefully the searchs will shed new light on the behavior of this unique flying butterfly and help preserve activities in the future.
Scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will continue to study both common and common, as well as those of the Sopoño Pipes, and the Danenton Bader of Innovo Garden in Westeros.
The whole Mosamme bats will be placed in major spaces around the Special Recorder area to track the activities.
NHS activists and volunteers will also conduct a ongoing survey using the portable device.
The sound of all records by experts will be sorted out and taken into consideration about the sequence of calls of bats and what the species is doing.
After that, a black map and report will be created to make an extensive landscape of their conduct.
The TS’ nature conservation counselor hopes that the results will show that the results are most important to those of the field, and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the beneficialness of housing management, such as how to protect the forest for its creations and bats and other species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK over the past century has been very low.
They are in danger of building and development work that damages their sleep space and housing.
The air-based turbines and lights may also be dangerous, such as some chemicals from fly paper and building materials, as well as pet cats.
Bats aren't blind.
However, their ears are more effective than their eyes when they hunt for hunting habit at night.
They use a better echo-location strategy to identify dangers and obstacles to the flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for the destruction of more than 270 historic buildings, more than 38 important parks and 78,000 hectares of land throughout the country, emphasized Badh.
There are ten trained experts, who conduct a regular study, visit sleepplace, and sometimes rescue.
The organization has also set up space for Scotland's first and only dedicated remains in the 3ve estates of Damfiz and Galoor, where eight of Scotland's ten-kidnth species are home.
The estate manager David Thompson says that the estate is the ideal place for bats.
"There is a good place for 3ve bats," he says.
"Here's the old building, there are many ancient trees and all the good houses.
But there are still many things that are unknown about the bats, so we can understand what we need here and elsewhere to survive."
He emphasized the importance of the presence of bats before maintaining property, as it could destroy 400 daughters and children, completely by destruction of a mother’s home.
It is illegal for people to be protected and killed, harass or destroy their homes.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Cherokee officer of the Batatab Trust, is encouraging the public to be able to help.
He says: "We still have a lot to learn about the demons and we don't know how many species live."
Ronaldo refused a rape charge and lawyers are going to bring a case against the German newspaper
He described the alleged rape charges as "false news" and said that people wanted to raise his name with their own "violation".
His lawyers are ready to file a case against German news magazine Der Spiegel, who made the complaint public.
This Portugal and Juventas Forward have been accused of rape an American woman named Catherine Manjoroga in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is accused of giving him $3175,000 to remain silent about the incident, according to Der Spiegel's report Friday.
A few hours after the claim was made public, he commented on his Instagram Live video with 1422 million Falls while speaking to his report as "false news."
"No, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," told Balion-Do's champion camera five times.
They want to raise their identity by using my name.
It's normal.
They want my name to be famous for themselves, but it's a livelihood.
I'm a happy man and all is fine." The player continues to smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Segel for charges that they called "unspoiled reports of suspectedness in secret."
Lawyer Christian Sherttz says that the player should be "one of the most serious insults to the moral rights of personal rights in recent times."
The alleged incident was reported to have occurred at a palm hotel and a casino in Las Vegas on June 200.
Nevada's Clark County District, according to the papers filed in the District Court, is said to go to the home of Ronaldo and Mayroga player after he met at a night club, where he was brutally raped.
The Mayorga claims that Ronaldo was polite after the incident and told him that he was disappointed by "99 percent", "one percent".
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but it was compromiseive.
Mayroga also claimed that he went to the police and took photos of his injuries at the hospital, but later he agreed to a decision outside the court, because he was "in awe of each quarter's fear" and "injury."
The 34-year-old girl says she is trying to restore the resolution because she is mentally upset by the alleged incident.
At the time of the crime, Ronaldo was among the ones who attended Real Madrid from Harvard United and joined the famous Italian club Juve in this summer with a $100 million contract.
Brakesit: Losing the position as a car manufacturer will ‘greate Aftoment time’
Minister of trade Gregor Clark said the United Kingdom will "send for a long time" lost its position in building cars after the brakes.
He also said that it was "spoiled" that the United Kingdom told the BBC that if Britain left U.S. without any agreement, they would stop the production of their factory in Barnes.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clarke.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that due to the breakpoint, people's jobs could be gone due to border delays.
Bernton's factory - which produces Toyota Oris and Avenis - has produced nearly 6,000 cars last year, some 90 percent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I think that if Britain got out of EU at the end of March, we would have to stop the production of our factory."
Hodda, B.W. and other motorists in the UK have expressed concern over the absence of the European Union without any agreement on how to run international trade, including the UK and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, B.W said that they would block their mini plant in Oxford after a month of tsiet.
The main concern is that cars are saying that the supply chain is at the risk of the free deal.
Toyoter production lines are based on "test-in-time", orders for cars that come from U.S. and EU providers every 37 minutes.
If March 229 left the United Kingdom without any agreement, the border could be interrupted so that it could delay supply and make it happen as trade palace.
The organization said that it would not be possible to keep the production of high prices in a day at Dubbyshire planet, which would have caused the closure of the production.
Mr. Clarke says that the checkner's plan to cover the future relationship with EU was "resa May" in order to avoid such checks.
"We need a deal, we want to do the best deal that will not only keep up to success, but also enjoy the prospect of future prosperity," he said on BBC Radio 4.
"Not only toyota, but other producers have proved that the successful supply supply systems are vital."
Toyota is unable to tell how long the production process will continue, but they have warned that long-term costs will reduce the ability of the factory and that many jobs can be lost.
In Bernton for 24 years and U.N. Union of the plant, Peter Suvalriis, said that his members are increasingly worried: "When I experience these things, they don't come back once they're through.
An official spokesman said: "We need to have a specific and reliable plan for future relations with EU."
The White House reported that the meet with Roseston might be more delayed.
On Sunday, the Prem Court said that a high level meeting with Donald issue and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosestein could be "send for another week".
Rosestein, who has been investigating Russia's intervention in the elections, the connection between the Lycans and Russia and the trial of the president, has also done Tuderer's work.
The scandal continues in Washington over the past few months over whether or not the Dalai Attorney General will be fired or not, and may be facing the question of Mouler’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported on Rosestein's use of secret Mike to record conversations with trumpets and the possibility of removing the president with 25th amendments.
Rosstein denies the report.
He was reportedly back at the White House on Monday, after his departure.
Instead, it was announced on Thursday that the meeting was held at the United Nations office in New York.
But Kavanf and his charges against him were among the women, Dr. Christine Blaz Ford, both accepted the testimony to the Senate's judicial committee's hearings.
On Friday, the FBI ordered a week of investigation into the charges against the Ferguson Kavanf, which resulted in a complete vote for the entire Senate.
The Lamb's press secretary, Sara Sanders, arrived at Fox News on Sunday.
Regarding Rosestein's meeting, he said: "No date is set, it could be this week, it could be a week before the Supreme Court for all other currents.
Let's see, and I always want to report to the press."
Some journalists would oppose this statement, and the Sanders didn't make any press meet on the White House after 10 September.
Breather Chris Wallace asks why.
Sanders say that it’s not because the Brining is not because of "showing" journalists, even though he says: "I don't deny that they’ve made it public."
He then suggested a direct contact between trumpets and press.
"The current president has asked more questions than any other president," he said without any proof: "We have judged the number."
Brifting will also happen in the future, says Sanders, "but that would be better than talking to the U.S. President directly.
We tried to do it very hard and you've seen us do it for the past few weeks, and it’s going to take place directly with the President of the United States in the spring. "
When Berber from the White House attended the press conference with prominent guests, he received regular questions.
A single press conference is few.
This week in New York, the press ministry probably showed why, acting unplanned and sometimes in front of a journalist's team.
Health Minister N. H.S. has written a letter to EU staff in Scotland in the fear of breakasit.
The Minister of Health, Scotland, expressed his gratitude to European Union employees working in the NHA, and wished them to stay in the breakout later.
Jean Freeman has sent a letter in less than six months before the U.K.E. comes out of EU.
The Cherokee government has already promised citizens to spend their time serving government services in the UAE.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: The negotiations between the UK and the EU over the summer are expected to be consequences.
However, the UK government is also preparing for a possible deal.
I know you're all going through a worrying time for it.
That's why I want to remind you now of how valuable their contribution to me without each member of the staff's nationality is.
The entire European Union and beyond, colleagues have brought valuable experiences and skills that have strengthened and improved health services and have benefited our patients and our community.
Scotland is your country and we want you to stay here."
Christian is an emergency operation after he's hit his head.
Mike Organ from Tennessee reports that Christian Christian Abercrembé of Tennessee State Tigers has been sending an emergency operation to Vanderbelt Commodores on Saturday after the match was defeated.
The head of the Tennessee State coach, Rod Ridd, told reporters that the attack was a short time ago.
Reed says, "He's a dead man on the side line."
The trainers and cosmologists gave oxygen to the sideline and later returned for further tests.
An officer from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of W.M. V, who was away from the Vanderbel Medical Center at Tennessee's Nashville.
Harris also said that "now there is no record of injuries/types" and Tennessee is trying to find out when the state is hit.
A second year old student in a red shirt was playing with Tennessee State.
Before coming out of the game, there were five of his Oracles on Saturday, in which he had a total of 18 tbols.
Foreign buyers will need more stamps when they buy property in the UK
According to Tori's plan, foreign customers will need to provide more stamps when they buy new properties in the UK and spend the extra money with the homeless.
This move will discourage the success of Corbin's campaign to attract young voters.
This stamp custom increase will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
Trajay hopes that this will increase income for the homeless to be worth more than 12 million a year.
Foreign customers will need more stamps when they buy property in the UK – and this extra money will be spent with the homeless, the Thresa May announcement.
The move will ease the success of Corbin's campaign to attract young voters as well as to provide housing at higher cost and target high incomes.
The stamp customs increase will apply to individuals and organizations who do not tax in the UK, and the extra cash will help the government with the help of homeless.
In addition to the current stamp custom, there could be more than three percent of those who were raised in the second house and rental house two years ago.
Trajari hopes that this increase will increase to Kerberos12 million a year.
At least 13 per cent of London’s newly built properties are buying outside the UK, which has increased prices and made the situation even more difficult for the first housing consumers.
Most of the country's elite regions - especially the capital - are becoming a "known city" for foreigners living abroad.
The new policy comes weeks after the call for the young generation to reduce stamps by buying their first home.
He accused large construction companies of increasing property prices rather than using land, and called Mrs. Mecha to cancel the house quotas to solve Britain’s "abusiness problem".
Mr. Corbin announced an interesting series of proposed housing reforms, including the end of rent control and "No-Fal" eviction.
He wants to give the Council more power to build new houses.
Mrs. May said: "Last year, I said that I would introduce my prime minister to restore the British Dream, which is that life should be more beautiful for every new generation."
And that means cureing the broken home market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to stay here, work and build a life.
However, it can't be true that foreign and foreign private agencies who don't live in the United Kingdom will buy property as easy as hard as hard as poor British residents.
To many people, the dream of ownership is far away, and the problem of homeless is very real.
Jack Ross: 'My final dream is to take charge of Scotland'
Sannderland Boss Jack Ross says his "conspiracy" is to be the manager of Scotland someday.
These 42-year-old Scotlandni enjoys the challenge of restoring the North-East Club, now behind three points from the first group.
The summer of the stadium of Light was brought back to St. Mendoza by her sister-in-law.
"I wanted to play for the country as a player.
I got a B cap and so far, "Ros told BBC Sporter of Scotland."
"But I grew up watching Scotland's match in Hadmden as a child, and it always picked me up.
If I succeed in my club, this could only happen."
Among its predecessors as the Sandland Manager is Dick Advoket, David Moss, Sam Eldoris, Martin O'Nil, Roy Why, Gustavo Pottt, and Paulo de Canio.
The former Alowa Attlettic boss said she did not feel disappointed by refusing to establish a large club like Bernsley and Mönach Town.
"Will I bring this club back to the Premier League right now?"
Because of the structure and benefits of the club, it certainly deserves the Premier League," he says.
"It's not easy to reach there, but I'll probably see myself as a success if I can get the club back there."
Ros's manager is only three years old, after 15 months of being a coaching staff in Dumton and Herts.
He then helped bring Awa back to the third level and transform the champion from the front door of St. Miran to a champion of the champions.
And Ros says that he is more comfortable now than being a Clyde, Harlellul, Falkerk, St. Miran, and Hamilton's academic career.
He remembers taking office in Alwar, "It's probably a real milestone."
"I really believed that management is better for me than sports.
It sounds strange to hear that I was right, lived a good life, and enjoyed some success.
But it's not that hard.
Every week you'll have to go through a lot of things.
I still feel the same way about the pressure to work, but the management seems to be right.
I've always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it, the most comfortable thing in my entire adult life."

The summer heatwaves have sparked a crowd in Britain's volts, but it has been pressured on the chain.
In July, the sales of pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent, but statistics revealed that they have been reduced to 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of CGA's business consultants, who compiled the statistics, said: "The rising sun and the unexpected participation in England at the World Cup will mean the same trend in July, when there is an estimated 2.8 percent increase in sales prices and the sale of rastera.
In June, it was much worse in July than 1.8 percent in business.
The head of the drink, and the bars have done so well so far, and the sales of the restaurants have become worse.
The main pubs are also suffering from the heat, but they have not been sold below as well.
It seems that people are just running out of here for a drink.
All drinks are up to 6.6 per month, as well as three per cent of the food sales".
retire and hospitality analyst R.M. Paul Newman said: "The latest trend in April continues.
The weather and the big social or sports events are the biggest impacts in the sale of markets outside the home.
It's not surprising that it's going to be a tough situation, but it's going to be a reduction of 4.8 percent in sales every year.
The long and hot summer time for food principal operators cannot come from the long, and whether the soft weather of August will provide some relief."
In July, the launch of the new year, and the total sales growth in the restaurants was 2.7 percent, which reflects the decline in the brand roll-outs.

Internet confused compared to mom and cow in the breast pump
A milk pumper also splits the opinion of the Internet with an advertisement to compare the breastfeeding of babies to beef.
In an effort to introduce what is said to be the "stamp for the world's first non-sounded breasts," the consumer technology organization LV has published an interesting music video form to show the freedom of the new pump to modern mothers.
Four real mothers danced with a straw, including Lirick: "Yes, I have my own milk wishes, but I don't have a tail" and "If anyone sees this, it's not the left of the beast, it's my breast."
Coras goes on: "Pamp it up, pump it over, I feed children, I pray my girlfriend's milk."
However, the commercial, which has been released on the company's Facebook page, has sparked online debate.
The video has received mixed reactions from viewers on 7,000 views and Shay Shay commentaries, many say it illuminates the "vigorousness" of the milk industry.
"The use of beef in the commercial of this product is very bad.
To create milk, they need to get pregnant and give birth to their children, the difference is that their children were stolen from them for a few days," wrote one.
The Lavi breast pump is placed in a fine nursing bre (LV/ mother)
Another commented: "It is disappointing for mothers and children to see that it’s for children.
But why wouldn't they be used in a package pump advertising for the mothers who are close to them?"
Another said: "It's very uncomfortable ad."
Others stood next to the ad, a woman admitted that she had "exceeded" her song.
"I think this is a great idea.
If I had breast milk, I'd have one too.
I think I'm a cow when I pump.
The ad is a bit crazy, but I did it well.
It's an innovative product," wrote one.
Another commented: "It's a humorous ad designed to target mothers who pump into their workplaces or toilets and think of themselves as "gru".
This ad praises neither art nor criticism."
At the end of the video, a group of women are saying that they all danced with hidden pumps in their bra.
The ad is based on the idea that many women feel like cattle when they pump their tits.
Although the LVP is totally unsurprising, it does not have a tube or tube, and fit into the nursing Breach which gives women a walk, keep them in arms, and even freedom outside.
Anna Balaryin, Mother's partner and the EDD said: "ElVP is a revolutionary product that should begin with courage and initiative."
By drawing parallel images of women and milked cows, we wanted to highlight our nursing pumpings and all its challenges in spotlights, in a entertainment and related manner, and to express the incredible sense of release of the new pump.
ElviPamp didn't take the news for the first time.
London Fashion Week, a mother of two, walks in Catawa for designer Marta Jakuboski.
Hundreds of migrant children were taken to a tent camp in the Texas border.
The number of migrant children has increased, while the monthly border crossing is relatively stable, as it has made it harder to maintain strict regulations and policies that keep children under their sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are afraid of losing the possibility of living in their own country without documents themselves.
The risk grew in June, when the Federal Authority announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families had to submit fingerprints, and the information would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Almence, an elderly officer at immigration and customs enforcement, testified to the Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who appealed to sponsor orphans.
The agency later reported that the 70 percent of those who lost their wives had no past crime.
"In the country, about 80 percent of the members of the Sponsor or sponsors remain illegally and a big part of them are criminals.
So we're going to keep looking for them," Nister Albania says.
In an attempt to further return to society, officials have launched new rules, including a month after the detention, which was previously held in court, as shelter workers reported.
Many will attend through video conference calls during their case, not personally, to the immigration judge for their legal status.
Those who are considered unworthy of relief will soon be driven out.
According to shelter workers and recent reports from the system in recent months, children are likely to have more anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent incidents or escape.
Supporters say these concerns are more intense in major centers such as Tornillo, which shows that children are more concerned, more likely to ignore.
They also said that if you don't have enough time to get your kids ready or remove your friends, you can get a few times before they're already suffering.
The United States, French and Turkish have asked Syria to move immediately.
In an address to the UN General Assembly, the Foreign Minister Walid al-Mawam called on Syrian refugees to return to the country, although eight years of war have continued in the country.
Molem, the deputy Prime Minister of the country, also said that foreign forces are illegally on the ground in the country in order to fight terrorism, and "we will take proper measures."
"They have to leave immediately," he told the council.
Molem stressed that "war against terrorism" in Syria, where more than 3600,000 people have been killed and millions have been forced to flee their homes since 2011.
He said Damascus will start “war until all the Syrian territories are cleaned up” against both terrorist and “non-relevant foreign presence”.
In Syria, there are about 2,000 US troops, Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs are mainly involved in training and consultations against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in this war-torn country.
In the question of refugees, Molemlem says that the situation is suitable for their return and that he blames “ some Western countries” for “providing fear” that prompted refugees to stay away.
“We are asking the international community and humanitarian agencies to help with this return,” he said.
"They are politics over the complete humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be provided with reform until it ends with a political deal between Assad and opposition.
The United Nations diplomats said that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey has allowed political dialogues to create a buffer zone at the last big rebel base of Idlib.
Russia-Turk deal has resisted a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the region, where three million people live.
However, Moyamlem emphasizes that the deal has a "constitution deadline" and that he hopes that the military step will work against the jihadists, including the war criminals from the Al-Qayda-Absara Front, who will be "prisoned".
The United Nations Ambassador, Staffan de Mirts, hopes to meet the first meeting of a new committee set up by the government and opposition members to draft the post-war constitution and facilitate the election.
The committee stated the condition of the Syrian government's participation in the committee that the panel should limit "to review Articles of the current constitution", and warned against undue interference.
Why the trumpet will win the second round

There's money out in the middle election like flood.
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania is running out of money at the 17th vote, since two candidates are fighting for one seat by the Congressal District.
Recently, in Rehabilitated suburb of Pittsburgh District they came to the battle with Democratic Representative Connor Lamb, who won a seat in another special vote last spring.
Lamb fighting Republican Keith Dafas, who is currently representing 12th districts of Old Pennsylvania, is much more than part of the 17th District.
In January, Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the old districts are constitutionally in line with the Republicans' right, which led to a map.
The funds of this new 1,7th electoral fight in District have been run by the Democratic Democratic Campaign (CCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).

Master of El Salvador to support U.S. China, then withdraw
The diplomats have noticed that Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, a step back from Washington.
Mr. also held a warm meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela in June 201, and had a hotel in Panama, but the partners removed the directors of the trumpet organization.
In a statement earlier this month, Foreign Department spokesman Hider Nyart said that officials decided to return the American heads of the US mission from El Salvador, Dominican Republic, and Panama to "the recent decision not to recognize Taiwan anymore".
However, only El Salvador was sentenced against those who received nearly $140 million as U.S. aid in the drug cycle control, development and economic assistance sector.
The proposed sentence, which included the layoff of financial aid and specific visa sanctions, could have made the Central American country sad because of its high unemployment and murder rate.
Along with the developments in the internal meeting, North America and Central America officials held a high-profile conference to prevent immigrants from gathering in the U.S., such as last year, as a move to prevent immigrants from joining in the US.
But in mid- September, top administration officials had made it clear that they wanted to do this, resulting in an effective end to the possibility of El Salvador's sentence.
The diplomats said that Vice-President Mike Pess will address the conference, scheduled for mid- October, to allow the imports of the administration.
And American angels in three countries quietly returned to the Republic of El Salvador, Panama and Dominican Republic with no new strong message or punishment from the side of Washington.
Mr. Bolton, a spokesman for the White House, refused to comment on the internal discussion of the two American officials, including two diplomatic officials who agreed on the condition that he was not named on the condition of the White House.
Their statement is confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to the administration, and has refused to disclose his name.

New York's Federal Casualra Saifulal Sayipov is looking for a death sentence for Sayylov, the suspect involved in a terrorist attack in New York to kill eight people; this rare punishment was not given to anyone after 91953.
Using a 30-year-old Cypov home depot truck, Cypov attacked the streets of Lower Manhattan on October to crush bicycles and pedestrians.
According to a notice from the South District of New York to execute the death penalty, the teachers must prove that Saipov is “deliberately” killing eight people and “deliberately” seriously.
According to the court record, both of them are sufficient to carry out the execution.
A week after the attack, a Federal Grand jury accuses Saipov of 22 points including eight murders, usually brought to organized crime, along with charges of violence and destruction of cars.
According to the way Cypov made the attack "the most dangerous, cruel, and distorted" it required "the right plan and precept."

He's accused himself of being innocent of these 22 points.
David Paton, one of the Federal Public Defenders representing Cypov, said that they were “spoiled by the decision of Kounsili.”

Cypov's legal party has previously appealed for the death penalty.

Radette said that shortly after the death of Chambers, Teles deleted texts from their own phone, call, and contact information.

Another black one?
New York has filed a complaint against a couple on charges of "racist" taxis after New York Nani.
A young woman in New York has been sued by a concerned couple for receiving confusing texts from a mother, calling her "the other black".
The couple refused to be racist and called for a case on the charge of "inappropriate."
The mother of the two children, Lincsi Plusco-Folxman, expressed disappointment after he reached the first day of work in 2016 to find out that Gigel Morris is a black man with a new baby.
Mrs. Pacco-Folxman writes in his husband's text message.
However, she sent it to Ms. Morris instead of sending it to her husband, twice.
He later realized that the “uncircumcision” disbanded Plusco-Folxman Miss Morris, who was once an African-American, and was expected to be a Filipino, as reported by a New York Post report.
Ms. Morris was given a day's mines and then sent back to Ubar.
Maurice is now suing the couple to receive compensation for the expulsion and is calling for a daily payment of $350 a day for six months, although he was hired to stay at home without any agreement.
"I want to show them, see, can't do this," he told the post on Friday, and added a more urgent conference, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple accused them of being racist, claiming that it was reasonable for Morris to believe he was accused of being racist.
He didn't want to say what my wife sent him.
He's not racist.
We're not a racist couple," said husband Joel Plusco Post.
"But are you going to let your children go to someone you've treated badly, even though it's wrong?
Your newborn son?
Tell me."
Regarding the charge of " right to injustice," Plusco said his wife only gave birth to children two months ago and was in "the most difficult situation".
"Will you go against anyone like this?"
It's not very good to do it," said the investment banker.
As the legal case continues, public courts have been strongly condemned by the couple's behavior and arguments on social media.
Betton Prokashoni is afraid that readers may not be able to deal with the bear, new papers expressing themselves.
The daughter of Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to say that the first time that it’s going to be written will be the thought of what is going to happen.
It's interesting to know that after the great success of Betton.
His father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before he was inspired by children's books from his little toy bear, said he was hopeful to reject his work, adding that last year, he had a 60th anniversary of his release.
Regarding Betton, whom he described as "the most important member of our family," says his father was very proud of his ultimate success.
"He was a quiet man, and was not a proud person," he said.
"Siltton was so real to him as if your own child had achieved something: you're proud of him, though there's nothing you can do.
I think he looked at Betton's success a bit like this.
Although it is his own creation and imagination, he always did credit Betton himself.
My daughter was on the way to death and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Nays Hospital, Luiz Pastet, where doctors tried to save her life.
"The bad phone called regularly and said it was bad, and he wouldn't survive," said Mrs. Greran-Laperos.
Then I got Nod's phone and found out he'd be dead in two minutes and I was forced to say goodbye on the phone.
And I do.
I say, "Tashi, darling I love you very much.
I'll come to you soon.
I'll come over to you.
The medicine the doctors gave him to activate his heart was slowly stopping his body from working and getting out of body.
He died a while ago and then it all stopped.
I had no choice but to wait and know everything.
I couldn't even shout or cry because I was in the family and people.
I had to hold on to myself."
Finally, Mrs. Greran-Laperoz, who was finally mourning her daughter's death, riding along with other passengers - was eager for this difficult situation.
Nobody knows," he says.
“I was low on my head, I was pouring tears out of my eyes.
It's impossible to describe, but I'm just sitting on a plane and making up for Nod's pain.
That he needs my love and empathy.
I know how good he was.
Sadly women posted cards to stop suicide on this bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones in suicide, worked to stop suicide.
He also posted cards with inspirational messages at the Wells Bridge and kept phone numbers where people can call for help.
Ms. Davis' son Tyler committed suicide at the age of 13.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I’m doing every day,” he says.
Ms. Davis, 55, who lives in Lidni, said his son had a promising Chef and a confectionious smile.
"All used to know him for laughing at him.
Everyone would say, "The house is bright in her smile."
Anyway, he quit his job before he died, because he really went into the dark.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, 11, found him dead.
Ms. Davis says: "I continue to worry that this effort will break."
Ms. Davis made card, "To tell everyone there are people you can talk to, he could be a friend.
Don't just sit down and talk.
Ms. Hamfres, Ms. Davis' girlfriend for years, had lost his 15-year-old partner Mark shortly after his mother died.
"He never said he was sad or sad," he said.
"I see a few changes in his behavior two days ago.
"The Christmas day was a bad condition - when the kids opened their gifts they didn't even notice."
He said his death had a huge emotional injury to them, but it had to be overhauled: "It created a huge void in the family."
He cut us apart.
But we have to go and fight."

At the start of the FBI investigation, the question of the future of B.I was raised by B.I.D. Kavanf.
"I thought if we could give him something he wanted - because it is limited to the time of investigation - we could probably bring some unity," Mr. Froke said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee might fall into the face of the "revenge".
What did Mr. Kavanoff and his Republicans want an FBI investigation?
About their obligations.
November 6th, only five weeks remain – if the Republicans do bad, their efforts will be very weak to get loved persons to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush is calling the senators and supporting Mr. Cov, who works under Mr. Bush, met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI released the FBI report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently living.
Mr. Kavanf is still not clear if he can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which if Vice-President Mike Pance can confirm him in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's defectors are under Kim's rule.
A South Korean lawmaker made this statement after Kim Jong-un arrived in power seven years ago.
Park Byung-seeg quoted data from South Korea's Ministry of Action, saying that last year, the number of defectors was 1,127 - which was 2,706.
Mr. Park said the main reason for the heavy border control and human trafficking between North Korea and China is the reason.
No public comment on the issue was made on Paniong.
A large number of defectors from North Korea have been granted South Korean citizenship.
Saul reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the illegal border since the Korean War ended in 953.
Most of them escaped from China, with the longest border with North Korea, and is much easier than crossing a highly protected zone (DMZ) between two Koreans.
China considers these refugees not refugees, but illegal immigrants, and often forced them back home.
The relationship between North and South Korea - which is still in the war - has been significantly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders from both countries held a meeting in Pyongyang to discuss the nuclear destabilization of the Nim.
This was followed by a historical meeting between US President Donald facet for Singapore and Kim Jong-un, when they agreed to work in the construction of a nuclear museum to build a nuclear weapons free of Korean weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young-ho blamed the US ban for the lack of progress.
In a speech held at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Mr. R says, "If there is no trust in the United States, we will have no confidence in national protection and we will not be first to destabilize ourselves in such situations."
Nancy Pelli called Brestiya Kavanoff a "stire" and said she was incapable of fulfilling her role in the Supreme Court.
The House's minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court Ninym , a "hestiya-in-law" and said he was inappropriately inappropriate in fulfilling his role in the Supreme Court.
Pelési commented on an interview at Texas Tribune in Texas on Saturday.
Pelési said in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, "I couldn't imagine that if any woman ever acted like this, she would be called "hitiria-stricken".
Kavanf denied his accusation strongly saying that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blaze when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanf was passionate, screaming at his family and high school life.
He clearly denounced the Democraticrs on the committee and accused the charges of being a “addicted and prosecuted figure” of the Libarals, accusing that this was being done from the anger of Hari in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelési says he believes Kavanf's testimony proves that he is not worthy of a Supreme Court, because it proves that he is against the Democratic Republic of Congo.
"I think he himself has proven to be inadequate in the way he made the statement and the way Clinton and the Democrats are opposed," he says.
When asked if Kavanf was sure and the Democrats got majority in their house, Pelsi expressed his frustration.
"I would say that if he didn't tell the Congress or the FBI the truth, he is not only qualified to Supreme Court, but he is not even in the court where he is now," said Pelsi.
Qavanf is currently a judge of the circuit core of the DC.
Pelési added that as a democracy he is worried that Kavanoff Afordable Care Act or R.V. Wade will be opposed because he himself is aide justice.
In his confirmed hearing, Kavanf ignored the question whether he would change some of the Supreme Court decisions.
"It can't be allowed to go to the court to tell us "it's not cool," Pelosi said.
And women should control it.
It comes out in a fair debate, month and year after year, and he can't cry.
"We cry when we get angry," Ms. Steem told me after 55 years.
"I don't think this is rare, what do you say?"
He added, "A woman executive in me has helped a lot, who said that he was angry and crying, but he chose the approach when he started to cry when he was angry, "You think I'm sorry, because I'm crying.
I'm really angry."
Then he continued.
I thought it was great."
The tears act as a stimulant of anger because they are misunderstandings.
A sharp memory of my early job, a man-in-chief, where I once saw myself in tears, an old woman holding my wrist - who was a scary manager - was always afraid of him - who dragged me to the stairs.
"Don't let them see you crying," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sorry and they'll be glad to see you."
Patrick Shroder, a former Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with him during Gary Hart's presidential election.
In 1997, when Mr. Heart was caught on a Makin Business boat in a foreign country about marriage and went out for dirty activities, Ms. Sharroda thought that he had no reason to be a candidate for his presidency.
"It wasn't a very well-known decision," she said after 30 years of laughing.
"There are seven other candidates in the fight, and none of them wanted to.
The one called it "Sno White and the seven dwarves."
After delayed early in the campaign, he was behind the collection and gave some kind of opinion that he would not be able to collect $2 million.
It was lost.
He saw that a supporter gave a man $1,000 only to him.
"Do they think I'll get the price?" she wonders.
When he announced that he would not practice official propaganda, he was deeply moved by passion and gratitude for his supporters, hard to collect funds, he targeted voters, and became ill with anger over gender discrimination.
"You would have felt that I was nervous," said Ms. Shroder by remembering the couple of news outlets.
"You would have felt that Cleonx was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking where they'd bury me?
"He cried?"
The US-China trade fight in Beijing
The first episode of the US-China trade war was absurd, and when the war finals, Beijing could benefit from this long-term conflict between the two countries, like experts.
US President Donald also first warned against increasing taxes on major Chinese goods including solar panels, steel, and twelfney products earlier this year.
The most notable answer is this week, when almost half of China’s imports are goods, with a total amount of $ 200 billion ($150 billion) to install new customs.
Beijing took revenge every time — most recently, it had five to ten to ten percent of its US goods.
China has decided to keep an eye on it, and there is no possibility that the world's second largest economy will be taken down soon.
It would be an insult to China's President Xi Jinping, who openly bowed down to the United States, to demand a backlash from Washington.
Still, experts say that if Beijing is able to play cards properly, the pressure of the US trade war can help China to reduce interstitution between two economys.
"The economic fall in both countries is far more dangerous than the immediate political decision of Washington or Beijing," says the Think Tank Tank Institute, co-founder of Center for New American Security, Abygel Grace, who practices Asia.
Syria called for its refugees to return, the Foreign Minister said.
Syria said that the country is ready to return, and that it has been asking for seven years of war-torn country to be restored.
While speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Malame said the situation is improving in the country.
"The situation today is stable and secure because of the progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the situation in areas that have been destroyed by terrorists.
As a result of terrorism and global economic crisis, leaving the country is now a happy situation for the people who are forced to leave because of their daily life and livelihood.
UN estimates that more than 55 million Syrians have fled Syria since the war began in 2011.
The remaining 6 million people from the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Malame said that the Syrian government welcomed all aid to rebuild the country.
However, he also stressed that there will not be any timely assistance or help from the rebels.

It's been a bad year.
Thank you Thomas for your faith in me and for my election.
I'm very happy to have the cup back.
It's the success of the team, I find that I can help," said García, moved by the European Joy.
He took responsibility for John Ram of his country, who lost the U.S. Lizard Tiger Woods on Sunday at 2 and 1 on Sunday.
"I was very proud to have lost Tigar Woods, raised by him," said Ram, a 23-year-old man.
Woods has lost four matches in France, and his record at Rider Cup has been 13-2-1-3.
This is the wrong statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major awards after only the top Jack Niklas.
Tim Ride, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finnau, the high-ranking Patrick Ride, went missing this weekend at team U.S. throughout the week.
“I am proud of these people, they are fighting,” Jim Ferrik of the U.S. captain said after his team’s disappointment.
This morning we put some pressure on Europe.
We couldn't.
Congratulations Thomas.
He's a good captain.
All 12 of his players were great.
"We will turn around, I will work with the USGA and Rider Cup committee.
I love these 12 people and am proud to be their captain.
You have to respect them.
We didn't get into the game."
