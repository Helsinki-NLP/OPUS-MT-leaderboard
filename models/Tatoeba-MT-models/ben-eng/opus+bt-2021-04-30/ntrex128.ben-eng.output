Welsh Ambly member's ownta is concerned about "like a mulet"
A number of Assemble members were panicked about the change in their positions MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reason for this panic is to change the name of the Assemble and propose to the Wesch Parliament.
Assemble members of various political parties fear to face ridicule by changing the name.
A Labour Party Associate member said that his team was worried that "with the Twp and Pweep with the new position".
For Welsh outside readers: in Welsh, Twp's meaning is a fool and the money of the pup.
A Playid Assemble member said that as a team, they were "not aware" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said the group saw the change in the name "open" but noted that the accent was slightly different between the MWP and the size.
In this sense, the words of Wesh WW are similar to the words of the U.S. race in English.
The Asembly Commission, which is currently in motion for the opening of the name change process, said: "The final decision on what will happen to the position of the Ambly members, must be the members themselves."
The Govs of Wales Act gives Wesley the right to change their name.
In June, the commission published a poll result in a proposal to change the name of the Asmmbly and receive a much support to the Welsh Parliament.
Regarding the position of the Apache members, the commission is supporting the Welsh Parliament Membur or the WMP, but received the MWP's highest support.
Apparently, the Apache members are suggesting different alternatives, but it would be difficult for Prijading Officers, Illinois Jones to reach the eccentricity, with the amendments of the law within a few weeks.
In this decree of reform, there will be changes related to the activity of the Astembly, including the unintendedness of members and the design of the committee system.
After the debate over the legislation, the Assemble members will receive a final vote on what their position should be.
Macedonians are voting in the referendum on the country's name change
Voters will be on Sunday to decide whether to change the name of their country to "Republic of North" or not.
The neighboring state Greece – with its own estate name – is a popular vote system to avoid a decade-long conflict with it.
Athens has long claimed that its northern neighbor name is a symbol of the establishment of its territory, and that the country's European Union and NATO objected to the appeal of membership.
President of the Republic of Macedonia, Ziyz Ivanov, who is opposed to the referendum on change of name, said he would ignore the referendum.
Although, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Jaev, felt that the name change was a necessary step to join only the European Union and NATO.
The Church of Harlem's Church is silent of the Saint Martins Falls
"The elderly people I spoke with said historically there was a church and a drinkhouse in each corner," said Mr Adams.
"There's none of it today."
He said that the issue of the disappearance of the pub was understood.
Currently "Human Social Communications" are in different ways.
"Pans are no longer in the area sitting room where everyone goes on a regular basis".
In the case of the church, he is concerned that the money sold by property, as long as the leaders think, "and today, and tomorrow, will return where they started."
He also said that the church's place could build apartment buildings and Condums where people would live in those people who would not help the rest of the area.
"In these buildings, most of those who buy Condums will be white," he said, "and so will they speed up the day of the closure of these churches because most of the people who are in this corner of the church are likely to become members of the church."
Both churches were established by the white congregation in 1870 before Harlem became a black-collar town – and in 1870, the Metropolitan Community, and the St. Martins after a decade.
The original white methodist congregation left the church in 1930.
The nearby worship of a black congregation took ownership of the building.
A black congregation under the Rev. John Howard Johnson took over St. Martins, who led a boycott against the retailers at the Wayback and Toddley Fiath Street due to the refusal of black employees to pay jobs and promotion - a major road to Harlem's shopping.
The building was badly damaged in a fire accident in 1939, but the residents of the Parish of Father Johnson planned to restore it, and they arranged the construction of the carillonty.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson, and heir of St. Martins, gave the Cylon "the bells of the people".
In July, the expert who played the carillonty, she called it something different: "A Historical Treasure" and "unreal historical instruments".
Experts, Universities of Michigan, Tifani Nieong, also said that it was a black Bader's Ortham Carlon of the Earth, which was devoted to the play of the Baja Dionyo A. Lindio A. Lin, 18 years earlier in the Riverside Church.
Mr Marywedar said that St. Martins did not replace him.
The events that happened in St. Martins in the last few months were a complex case of the architects and the Bedders, who were appointed by the general leaders of the Church or the APospal Diasis.
Vesstrari – Parish's body, composed of ordinary leaders – told them of their concern that in July they would "take the money" of Diocese Veterinary, although the appointment of the diary was not involved in the appointment of the architects and the staff of the right-wings.
Some members of Parish complained about the lack of transparency in the work of Diasis.
Shark attack in California after a 13-year-old Gaulda shrimping
A 13-year-old boy was injured by the shark attack after he was drowning for the first day of the Gaulda shrimp season on Saturday, officials said.
The incident of the attack took place at Bison Beach, near Nincitus, before 7:00 a.m.
Chand Hammel told San Diego's KSWB TV that he heard the boy's screams for help on Saturday morning and that he was able to take him out of the water with a group of people.

‘He bites me!'
His throat's throat tearing," Halel said, saw him reaching the boy.
"I cry for everyone to come out of the water: 'The sharks are here!' adds Hamel.
The boy is sent to the children of San Diego to the hospital where he is in a terrible state .
The species of the attacker sharks were not known.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Zayles said the presence of a shark was seen in the area a few weeks ago, but it was identified as not dangerous species.
Zyles also said that the infected man had suffered serious injuries at the top of his neck.
Officials banned access to the beach from Cassablad Beach to the Swamy of the Nonytus and for 48 hours for security investigation and safety.
Zyles reports that more than 135 species of sharks are seen in the area, most not dangerous.
Census are planning to enter the UK market
Census boots, Superdrags and Debenhams are going to be contested in the business of the department store, in the business of traded Isles and specialists.
As part of the heavy effort to enter the United Kingdom, these large-scale Isles will be opened to 11 stores across the country and will be opened to other stores if proven to be successful, increasing the market in the United Kingdom, where fashion and household decorations have fallen into market.
These investments are coming in as Supermarks are looking for new ways to fill up with TV, microwaves, and home decorations.
Census said it would double its shapes to 30,000 goods, which would have been the first time in the renovation, E.E., Toyzerman, and Doctor Pot.
Lo'el, Mebelin, and Bertes will be able to find more physiological ranges, including separate venues for brands such as Boots.
Supermarkite's bootic makeup ranges so that most of its products become Vigan Friendley – which has become very popular among young customers.
In addition, the perfume seller The Ferriment Sp would run a test of the distribution of products to the Secrecy store, the first of which was launched last week in the purchase of South London, and the second in part of Birmingham's Seley Oak in the following year.
Online shopping and local grocery stores are meant to buy a small amount of food, meaning that supermarks have to try extra for customers.
Mike Kue, Chief Executive of the Census, stated that the outlets would have to look like the department store since the supermarked chain is competing with the stores such as Adrian and Lidal and will have more services and food-no-no-one products.
Census, two years ago, after the sale of the Argus and Habitats chain, the company claimed the sale of several stores in the store and a number of Habitats and openings, increased the sales of the grocery product and made it more profitable.
The supermart's form and the premises of the farm department failed to pour out.
Census tested a joint project with the first dull boots of the 2000s, but the project stopped due to the conflict over how the quarry profit from the store in the supermarkets.
The new technique is taking place after Census sold to their 281 shop firm Lloyds Farmers' owner, Celecio.
The company said that by adding a luxury range of Skinkeer brands, Lloyds would play a role in the plan, including La Roosevey and Cincinnati with four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix, Commerce's commercial director, said: "We changed our rice-drivens to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in the recruitment of trained staff who will be present for advice.
Our brand ranges have been planned for all kinds of needs and due to the attractive environments and facilities we now have become a reliable form of destination that will challenge the old methods of shopping."
Peter Jones' 'University' to withdraw from the contract of Holly Willowby 11 million.
TV host Holly Willowby Mars and Spencer with his new contract to focus on his new contract with Dragons Deon's star Peter Jones' Lifestyle brand, Peter Jones is angry at the lack of the deal.
There is no time in Willowby's hands for their home items and performance brand Trully.
The pair was compared to the Gyneth Patoltro's spy brand with the business.
This morning host, 37, reported his departure to Instagram.
Holly Willowby has angered the Dragons Day star Peter Jones by withdrawing their interesting lifestyle brands from business to the final moment — focusing on Markers and Spencer and ITV contracts with her new bumper.
Sources said Jones became angry "incompetent" when on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Balkinghamshire, the golden girl admitted that her new deal - which costs up to $1.5 million - has no time for their housework and electronic brand Truley.
The business was compared to the Gyneth Patoltro's spy brand, and the Willowby was expected to double the wealth of 11 million pounds.
After reporting his departure from Trully on the Willowby, 37, Instagram, Jones left Britain in a jet to make his vacation home.
One source stated: "Truly so far was the top of Halli's list.
It was part of his long-term future plans that would make him pay for his financial needs for the next few decades.
His withdrawal's decision shocked everyone involved.
Tuesday was no one able to believe the Jawa incident, the project was scheduled to be opened very soon.
In Marlow's headquarters, there is a barn full of goods that are made for sale."
Experts think that the present-time present-day Britain's most reliable starry starry, the firm may have a million pound loss because of its departure because they have already had large investments on products such as candles, clothes, and housing materials, and that its launch will add to the immediate loss of its launch.
And that may end a long-day friendship.
Three children's mother, Willowby, and her husband Dan Baldwin, were close to Jones and his wife, Tama Cap.
The Willowby began with Cap in 2016 and joined Jones, 52, March.
Together, the pair spend the holiday together and have 40% of Jones' share in Baldwin's TV production farm.
The Willowby Mands will be a brand ambassador and will replace the Ant McTranlin as the host of ITV events.
An intimate source of Jones said yesterday night: "We will not comment on his business transaction."

"I didn't give any concessions."
He said that Kim was interested in meeting the second time after their initial appearance in Singapore in June, Trump claimed their first encounter to be a huge step towards the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But the deal of nuclear disinfectation has gone to thirteen.

However, he said the United States had a ban on the application of pressure.
Trump expressed a more positive view during his speech at his rally.
"We're in good position with North Korea," he said.
"We faced a battle with North Korea".
It could have killed a million people.
Now we have great relations."
He claimed his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim brought positive results – which led to the end of rocket testing, to release prisoners and to bring back the rest of the American staff to the country.
And he defended his unusual approach to speaking up about Kim's relationship.
"The presidential act is very easy, but instead of trying to stand outside of the 10,000 people in the city of Erina, there were only 200 standing here," Trump pointed out his finger to the public palace.

The statue of the House of Representatives of the Parliament, the new victim of the "History Rediscoverment"
The statue will be removed after the destruction of the multicultural and religious landmarks of England by his religious followers.
But the chromwell Society has informed Mr. Creek's advices as "a sense of understanding" and "trying to repeat history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cocowell Society, said: "The marking of the statue of Oliver chromwell, located outside the present-south palace of West Carolina, would be inevitable.
The iconroclaim or landmarks of the English House of War did not be edited by the command of the chromwell.
In the previous century, the wrong chromwell statue of his predecessor Thomas would be sacrificed.
The extraordinary statue of the chromwell produced by Sir William Hymo Thornt is part of the 19th-century opinion and part of a historical character that many people consider to be worthy of celebration.
The Sunday Telegraph said to Mr. Goldsmith: "Many people think chromwell is the governor of parliament in the face of external pressure, in his case, against the pressure of the monarchy - which is now the opinion of a few people in the 19th century.
But whether it is a complete correct picture of the time, it is part of the ongoing historical debate.
What is sure is that the conflict in the mid-17th century has led to the next development of our nation, and chromwell is a well-known character who represented a side of the division.
His achievements as Lord Prototron deserve to be celebrated and remembered."
Murdered pig killed Chinese farmers
According to local news reports, a pig attacked a farmer in a market in southwestern China.
The man, only identified as his clan name "Ian", was found in a report by Liupanhui at the market in the province of Guijo, South China, on Sunday, after being found in the South China Morning Post.
On May 30, 2005, a pigeon in Shiining, China, a pig feathers are preparing for vaccines in a pig farm.
Prospecting, he came to the market on Wednesday from the nearby city of Yunnan with his cousin.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and saw that a pig's door was opened on the side.
He said that there was a large man pig in the stable with blood on his mouth.
A forensic test ensures that a 550-pound pig attack the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were two blood and scarves," said Sodato's brother, who was identified as his family name "U", but quoted by Guiiyang Ivining News.
The security camera footage shows Yuan entered the market to give his piggies food in four minutes on Thursday.
He was found dead about an hour later.
The pig that kills the man isn't the man or the brother of his aunt.
One of the market managers told Ivinning News that the police are collecting evidence at the scene and keeping the pig locked apart so that it could not attack someone else.
Yuan's family and market authorities are discussing the amount of compensation for his death.
Although rare, pig attacks have occurred before.
In 2016, a woman and her husband attacked a pig attack on their farm in Massachusetts, with the man seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig weighs the xish farmer with the back of his trucks until his wife came and threatened the pig.
After eating a farmer in Orygon in 2012, A farmer told CBC News that the pigs were usually not aggressive but that blood tastes could serve as a "incorporate" or "experience."
"They're just messing up.
They bite small bites, very interested creatures... but do not try to hurt anyone.
But you have to go on enough of them," he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will make the Southwest United States heavy rains
For example, the cyclone's energy is weakening as Hurricane Rosa flows over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
Although Rosa would be flooded in the north of Mexico and in the southwestern part of the United States, it would be a floodfall.
During the early morning of Sunday, at 5pm, Rosa had a catagri 1-year-old freight with a speed of 85 miles per hour, and a position of 385 miles in Punta Eugene, Mexico.
Rosa is scheduled to go north on Sunday.
At this point, a mechanism began to form in the Pacific Ocean and headed west of the United States Coast on Monday as a seasonal storm in the Rosa Bauha California Peninsula, and it would lead to the north to the southwestern United States.
Rosa's cause would rain up to 10 inches in different parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, in addition to the deep tropical humid approach, heavy rains will be caused by the coming days of the southern part of the country.
At least 1 to 4 inches of rain from locally to 4 inches, the dangerous flashing or sudden flooding, the flow of debris, and possible landslides in the desert.
Due to deep tropical physiology, rain levels can be between 2 and 3 inches per hour, especially in various parts of South Nevada and Arizona.
There is a possibility of raining from 2 to 4 inches in various parts of the southwestern part of Arizona, especially in most parts of Arizona.
Due to the slowing speed of tropical rains, the flashing and the rapid decline of the situation is possible.
It would be foolish to walk out of the desert on foot under the threat of tropical rain.
Due to heavy rains, the Canyon shoots can be turned into a dangerous river, and the lightning would remain strong with the wind.
Due to the flow, heavy rains will be carried locally in various parts of the southern California shores.
The amount of rainfall can be half-inch that can cause small debris to flow in the plating roads.
It will be the first rainfall of the region during the rain season.
From Sunday night and Monday morning, there may be some distracted tropical rains in Arizona, increasing the rain from Monday to Tuesday night to Tuesday to Tuesday.
The heavy rain will reach the four corners on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
A number of extreme temperatures can be seen in the United States region in October as the Arctic cooling, but the tropical temperature is still very warm.
As a result, it is sometimes a dramatic change in temperature between a low distance.
Sunday is an excellent example of the dramatic change of temperature in the middle of the United States.
Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines, are seen the difference between about 20 degrees in Iowa.
In the next few days, summer's warmness will try to grow and spread again.
The beginning of October in most parts of the United States and eastern parts of the United States was scheduled to be warmer, with 80 temperatures in the area from the southern plains to the northeast.
On Tuesday, the temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees, which is approximately 10 degrees above average temperature.
Our long-term climate forecasts suggest that in the first half of October the U.S. temperature is much more likely to be higher than the average temperature in the eastern part of the United States.
Brett Cavana's hearing saw more than 20 million people.
Christine Blanci Ford, the alleged sexual assaults filed by the Supreme Court nominated by Bret Kevana and her allegedly in the 1980s, saw more than 20 million viewers on the Tantan television network on Thursday.
At this point, the political dispute continued, broadcastingers suspended regular events due to Friday's last moments: a contract made by the Arizona Senator Jeff Rogers that will take place for a week to investigate the FBI complaint.
Ford Senate told the Judicari Committee that he was a hundred percent convinced that Kavana was in a party of high school while he was drunk and tried to open his clothes.
Kavana said in a passionate testimony that she was a hundred hundred confident that the incident did not happen.
There is a possibility that Neilsen's report saw more than 20.4 million viewers on Friday.
The company was averaged at CBS, ABC, NBC, NCN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Other networks, which broadcast the activity, did not immediately include the number of viewers, including the PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Neilsen usually faces problems in the audience's quality of sitting in office.
The program's audience was equal to the number of football playoffs or Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion presenters strongly supported Cavana's nomination, this entire day-to-day hearing broadcasts attracted the highest number of viewers in all networks with an average of 5.9 million, Nilsen said.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS saw 3.1 million, NBC saw 2.94 million, MSNBC saw 2.89 million and 2.52 million viewers, Neilsen reported.
Despite hearings, the interest was in the tug.
Flick was in the federal character of today's drama.
After giving statements in favor of the moderate Republican office, he was captured on Friday morning by Cavanna and CBS's camera, when he boarded the elevator to reach the hearing site of the Judicari Committee and the protesters.
He stood down for a few minutes in the face of the protesters, which aired the NCN live.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think Kevana is telling the truth to the country?"
He is called "You have powers, when many women are helpless."
Freak said that his office issued a statement and said there was more to him in the committee hearing.
Later, when Cavana's nomination went on to vote for the full Senate, the Judicial Committee voted, airing all of the cables and broadcast networks.
But Flick said he would vote on the condition that the FBI would investigate the charges against the chosen person in the following week, with requests that the minority Democrats were coming.
The conversation with Democratic Senator Chris Kun was partially affected by the consent of Rebecca's friend.
After talking to Kun, Flick spoke to several other senators and concluded his conclusions.
The Darwin's decision was breath, as the Republicans did not have a clear vote to approve Cavana without investigation.
President Trump launched a FBI investigation based on allegations against Cavana.

In front of the anniversary of the independence vote, a police clash with the Catalan separatists
The clashes with supporters of freedom led to six arrests on Saturday in Barcelona, when they joined the protesters against the first year of the election, which was disputed by the people.
A group of masked separatists threw eggs, and paint powders in the face of police barriers that resulted in the creation of black clouds on the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
In the next half of the day, there was also a fight that the police used the stick to stop.
In a few hours, the freedomists faced the slogan "Don't go wrong, I won't forgive" who was chanting "Long live Spain".
14 people took medical treatment for minor injuries due to protests, according to local news outlets.
There is excitement in the area of independence since the declaration of the Assembly of Madrid illegally declared by the separatist Catalans on October 1.
Voters voted for independence, although the number of voters was low because most people boycotted the vote against isolation.
According to the Catalan authorities, there were nearly 1000 people injured in deadly clashes with police during the last year's vote.
Freedomists were on the streets all Friday night to prevent the national police from showing up.
The protesters continued their activities but were forced to go to different streets.
68-year-old Nurseis Tours, a power activist with his wife, who is a member of the separatist protests, said that he is no longer optimistic about the freedom of Catalonia.
"Last year was one of the best times of our life.
Happy to vote, I saw my parents come to tears, but we're stuck now," he said.

Dolly Mearer's first goal was confirmed by the playoffs as of Honson.
The promotional Earlian Rangers have a second defeat in 18 games as the director of the Steven Gerard Club.
Dolly developed a gap as Gary Thorn's team scored a second goal with Hiburnians.

Earlier, on Thursday, Rangers at the Europa League will give Vienna a tenure.
Tangin, already their undefeated race in the Division has increased to six games, the head coach to come in the last month as a replacement for Keni Miller has yet to taste defeat.
Hron missed a number of chances against their borrowing opponent.
They should have been ahead long before the team scored, since their aggressive attitude caused all kinds of problems for the Rangers!
Scott Robinson went through the motions but failed to make his own efforts successful, then Alan Lithgo could only run his work on Wydei, after a slide to meet Craig Halket's header.
The hosts were going to play for the Rangers in front of them knowing the visitors could trouble them in Set Peace.
And that trick came the important goal.
Rangers made a free-key Conservatory and opened the Conservative goalbook, Deklan Galgar and Robinson Mega to set up, who scored the goal from a touch box centre.
At this point, the Rangers had the power, but they were aware of the defenses of the welcomings and the goalkeeper Lawy Kely spent most of the time.
The sequence continued in the second half, although Alfred was holding a shot at Morlos Kelly.
Scott Pitman was defeated by Rangers' goalkeeper Alan McGrigo's feet and another set of Peace Jettton for Lithgo Wide.
The cross was constantly moving to the Croston box and continued to be clear, although the two Penaltics claimed, the alternative Glenn Middleton, after the Hart's challenge, and for handball, was dismissed.
Incumbent's 'perception' - analysis
BBC's Lamont Tony McCarni in Alasia, Scotland
A great performance and results in the favor of Honson.
To some individuals, they were fierce, continuing beyond the expectations of all at their own pace.
After returning to the top, their play style and player has rarely changed, but the credit must be to the side of the team he has made since it came to him.
He was a lot of heroes.
Captain Halket was amazing, creating a highly organized defence, and keeping Menga Conor Goldson and Joe Warl always.
Although Rangers were less inspiring.
Under Gerard, they fell down the standard they were good.
They lacked their final ball - only once they opened the welcomeers - and it is a warning for Rangers who are now on the table at midnight.
Erdove got mixed with colon
The situation was very pleasant for the leaders of Turkey and Germany to meet the Brassit in Berlin on Saturday (29 September 2019).

The National Weather Council has already issued flash flats on the south and east of Arizona for Som and Tuesday, including Phoenix, South-east California and Yuta, FlagStaff, Las Vegas and Salt City.
Rosa is expected to return directly to Phoenix on Tuesday and to the end of Monday.
In a tweet from the Phoenix National Weather Office, the House of Representatives noted that only "the twentieth tropical cyclones continued to remain in the tropical storm or lower conditions between 200 miles since the 1950s!
Katrina (1987) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the A Z border."
The last National Hurricane Center's model predicts rain from 2 to 4 inches, in the Arizona Moglion Remé, which can be 6 inches.
Other regions of the southwestern desert, including Central Rockis and Great Besin, have the possibility of raining up to 1 to 2 inches, which may reach 4 inches in the isolated area.
Rosa's rain may be blessed for the people outside of the flood risk since the region is drought
Although the floods are serious concerns, although the southwestern is currently experiencing drought conditions, the rain will likely be somewhat beneficial.
According to U.S. drought observations, Arizona has faced more than 40 percent of the extreme drought, it has reported Weather.com as the second highest cattery.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path will cause landslides across the California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, which is still a powerful hurricane, is the highest speed of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, 385 miles south of Punta Ezenia, Mexico and extending 12 miles per hour to the north.

Rosa will then travel northward as a low-chap in the summer of Arizona before reaching the dawn of Tuesday, and it will enter southwards to Arizona on Tuesday night.
"The expected major danger from the end of the Troja or It's is the Baja California, the northwest part of the United States and the southwestern desert is very heavy rain, according to the National Hurricane Center".
This rainfall can result in deadly flooding and destructive currents in the desert, and the landslides in the mountainous region.

The tsunami came after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"The people continued their activities at the beach as a threat to the late tsunami, and those who did not immediately run away and became victims," Indonesia's disaster premises spokesman Sutopo Phugroho said in a buffalo in Jakarta, Indonesia.
"Sunami didn't come from itself, it was pulled by cars, logs, houses, it hits all the ground," Nugroho said, the tsunami traveled 800 kilometres (497 mi) in the open sea before it hits the shore.
Some people came to the tree to survive the tsunami and they survived,
About 16,700 people were moved to the 24 centre of Palmer.
The images released by the disaster agency showed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, the bridges were torn apart, and a mosque was drowned in water.
The Aftarchs also visit Dapia in the coastal city of Saturday.
The series of earthquakes felt in the region with 2.4 million people.
In a statement, the Indonesian Agency for the Essence and application (BPPT) said that the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday was nearly 200 times the power of nuclear bombs in Hiroshima in the Second World War.
The city's geographical location, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, can increase the size of the tsunami
Nugroho described the damage as "bunking" that tens of thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping and hotels were broken.
Some of the affected bodies were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed building, adding that 540 were injured and 29 missing."
Nugroho reported that the casualties could be higher in the area of Dingala, a region close to the coastal center of the coastal central of the coastal area, with a distance of 300 kilometres (190 km) from Palmu.
The communications system "was completely crippled without any information" Nugroho said.
There are over 300 people living in the area, "Red Cross says in a statement, and adds that employees and volunteers are going to the affected region."
"It's already a tragedy but it could be worse."
The Saturday Agency was widely criticized for not giving the information because of the tsunami Palu, although officials said that the waves came when the warning was issued.
One on the top of the building, shared on social media, appeared to be heard by people on the following road.
In a few minutes, a wall of water hits the shores and throws the building and cars.
Reuters did not immediately prove the footage.
Earthquakes and tsunamis result in electricity outages that break up communications around Palmu and make the authorities uncomfortable with the search for rescue.
The military began sending cargo planes to Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, rescuers now need food and other basics.
The city's airport is only re-launched for relief efforts and will be closed for the generals until October.

Dobass continued, "They saw many houses destroyed there."
It's sad.

Kein West : The one whose name has been changed by the one whose name has been changed .
The one whose name is called by the Lord West .
With the announcement of the change, he wrote on Twitter on Saturday: "The officially known Cain West".
West, 41, was also known for some time as Ye and used the name as his surname.
The name change was revealed before its appearance at the TStarday Night Live, where he hoped to reveal his new album Yody.
The show producer said that he was replacing singer Arana Grande in the show who cancelled the show "in the emotional state".
West had previously said that the term was religious significance to him, as well as his current professional name.
When discussing the title of the album at the beginning of the West, Radio Stakelock Big Boy said, "I believe that 'y' is the most used word of the Bible, and that it means 'you'.'
"So I'm you, I'm us, that's us.
From Cain, it is said that the only person, yes, reflects our good, bad, our confusion, everything.
This album reflects our more identity."
He was one of the most famous peoples who changed their names .
Sean Combles is known in various ways as Puff Daddy, PD or DD, but this year he announces a greater preference for Love and Brothers Love.
J-G, a former associate of West, has worked on the capital without Hyfen, and without the Hifen.
Mexican AMLO has sworn not to implement military force on civilians.
Mexican elected President Andrés Manuel López has sworn in the 50th anniversary of the violent torture against students that he will not force military force against the citizens.
López Obrado promised on Saturday that "do not apply military force to torture Mexicans."
On 2 October 1968, soldiers shot down peaceful protests that killed 300 people while the leftist student movement was making their own strong stance in Latin America.
Lopez Obrado's young Mexican Duck apologizes with help to build monthly education and further public universities.
He said the lack of unemployment and education opportunities attracted young people to crime groups.
The United States should offer double funding to artificial intelligence.
China, as more active in artificial intelligence, U.S. and should be able to double the cost of research, says artificial intelligence researcher and investor Kai-fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft, and Ep.
The statement comes from various parts of the government, declared in the United States that there is a formal strategic shortage in artificial intelligence in the United States.
Meanwhile, China launched its new plans in the year 2030: its goal is to acquire number 1 in artificial intelligence in 2030.
Lee also said, "The double budget will be a good start in the research with the majority of the countries in this case, and we are looking for the next step to progress in artificial intelligence."
Double funding can double the chance to acquire the next major artificial intelligence in the United States, this week, Lee said it in an interview with CBC.
Lee, whose book "All Superpas Wars: 'China, Silicon Valley and The New World Order', is the chief executive of Hoton Miflin Harcottt, Sinnovation Vegetarian Veteran, one of China's leading artificial intelligence organization Facultys+.
In the 1980s, Carnegi worked on an artificial intelligence system that defeated the highest-level American player in the University of Melon, and he was the CEO of Microsoft Research and president of the China branch of Google.
The previous U.S. government's technology competition, such as the Li Defense Advanced Research Project Agency's Robotics Challenge, admits to the next step.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to win the government grant, Lee said.
"China is not taking away academic leaders; corporates are giving," Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology organizations have been appointed by universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that the changes in immigration policy can help increase the efforts of the U.S. AI in the United States.
"I think the Green Card should automatically offer to the PhD in artificial intelligence", he said.
China's State Council issued a plan for artificial intelligence development of his next generation in July 2017.
China's National Institute of Natural Sciences Foundations, such as National Science Foundation and other government agencies, provided the funding of U.S. researchers, but there are fewer standards of academic work in China, said Lee.
The U.S. Department of Defense established a joint artificial intelligence center earlier this year, which meant the involvement of partners of art and academics, and the White House announced the formation of the election committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DRPA announced a $2 billion investment in a initiative called AIBA.
As NSF, it currently invests more than 100 million dollars per year in artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Act of an effort to form the National Protection Commission of artificial intelligence has not seen progress within a few months.
Macedonians voted in the referendum on whether to change the name of the country.
On Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on whether to keep its name in the Republic of the North of the Republic, a move that would solve a few decades old conflicts with Greece that blocked efforts to gain membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where the name Macedonia has a province, its northern neighbor's name represents a claim to its territory, and the entry of NATO and the European Union.
Two governments made a deal in June on the basis of the proposed new name, however nationalist opponents felt that the change would undermine ethnicity to the Slavic majority of the Slavic population.
President Ziyz Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and suspect whether the Tournament would meet 50 percent of the requirements required for the referendum is valid.
The question was in the referendum ballot: "You're for NATO and European Union membership with the recognition of the treaty with Greece."
The Prime Minister, Zoran Jave, with whom supporters of change, argue for a price to be admitted to the European Union and NATO Organization for the Fall of Yugoslavia.
"I've come today to vote on behalf of the country's future, in Macedonia so that they can live freely in the shadow of the European Union because it means safe lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgesovka, 79-year-old.
While not legally compulsory, the members of the Parliament said that they were willing to comply with the outcome of the vote by decision-making.
There is a need for two-thirds of the majority in parliament to change the name.
The State Election Commission stated that there was no news of a 1 noon Nagad ostensibly.
However, only 16% of the votes were taken by the 2016 National Assembly election, when the registered voters had 66% voted.
"I'm here to vote for my children, we have our place in Europe," said José Teenovsky, a voters from the capital, Chisch, in the capital.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Jaev, his wife, and his son, Zenika, voted in favor of the referendum on the country's name to change the country's name, which will open the way to NATO and joining the European Union in Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardkov was preparing a small stage and drew chairs in front of those who boycotted the referendum.
"We are on the side of NATO and the EU, but we are not at the door of the service, we want to raise our heads," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity."
If they don't want to take us as guests, we can go to others like China and Russia and be part of the Euro-Asia solidarity."
Prime Minister Jabyev said NATO membership will bring necessary investments to Macedonia, where unemployment rates are higher than 20 percent.
"I believe there will be a large majority favor because our 80% of our citizens are in favor of the European Union and NATO," Jave said after giving his ballots.
He said that a "yes" result would be our "responsible confirmation".
A survey published last Monday by the Institute of Policy Research stated that 30 to 43% of the voters will be participating in the referendum under the requirements required for the return out.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV showed that 57% of the respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
70% of these said they would vote yes.
The referendum needs to be one of the more than 50% of the vote to succeed.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first severe injury in Western government policy since taking power in May.
See: Serio Aguero in Manchester City enters the entire Brighton Defense for the goal
In the late Manchester Stadium of Manchester, England, Braton defeated the Braton Defense at the 2–0 in Manchester City on Saturday.
Aguero made his score too easy to see at the 65th minute.
At the beginning of the sequence, the Argentines received a pass in Midfield.
Before moving to the open field, he ran through three Brighton Difenders.
Aguero was then surrounded by four Green Jerseys.
On the edge of the Brighton box, he turned a defender.
Then he pushed a pass to the left, which found Sterling.
Using his first touch in the English forward box, he returned the ball to Aguero, who was using his right boots to beat Braton defender Matthew Ryan, to shoot at the right side of the net.
"Aguro struggles with a bit of trouble on his feet," City manager Pip Gardiola told reporters.
"We talked about his play for 55, 60 minutes".
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal at that moment."
Sterling, however, gave Sky Blues the initial advantage of the Premier League's fight.
The goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero got the ball in that game in the Bryton region.
He sent the ball to Lire Sen with a fine route on the left side.
Sen took a few touch before moving Sterling to a distant post.
The ball was tapped into the net just before the Sky Blues reached the range.
In the group of City Championships would fight Hffenheim in the group, at 12:55 on Tuesday, at the Rain-Neker-Anrena, Germany.
Sherzar Speyler wants to play at the Rockis match.
There was not much reason to force any other start after the Nationals removed the debate from the playoffs.
However, the ever competitive Sherzer hopes that he will be taking over the Mars against Colorado Rockys on Sunday, if only then one-goer head-of-the-structures on the side of the WL West's Los Angeles Dodgers.
Rockis received at least Wild Card at least a 5–2 victory against the Nationals on Friday night, but they still want to achieve their first division title.
"Even though we're not playing for anything, at least we can step in rubber with Denver's audience and the other team probably know that I'm going to play at the top level of any point I'm facing this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in it?"
Nationals have yet to announce a starter for Sunday, however it has been said that Sherzar can be able to shake up in such a situation.
Sherzar, who will start his 34th season, throws a Bullpen session on Thursday, and picks up his usual retrief on Sunday.
In this season, Danhati 18–7, including 220/3 innings and 300 Strickouts.
Trump gathering in West Virginia
While speaking about the importance of the Republican Republic in the mid-election, the President strongly cited the situation in the surrounding situation of the Bachelor Cavana, who was chosen by his Supreme Court.
"All we've done is in jeopardy in November".
Five weeks from one of our most important elections.
It's a large, large -- I'm not running but I'm really running all over the place to fight for the brilliant candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see the Democrats the horror, the horror radical group, you see it happen right now.
And they are determined to take back any means that they need to take back energy, you see this lowness, ambition.
They don't care who they are hitting, power and control, they just want strength and control, we don't give it to them."
He said the Democrats were on a mission to "concerning and obstructing."
"And you see it that for the last four days," he said, the Democrats were "aggressive and downward and unfaithful."
He was named Democrat Senator of the Senate Department of Justice, Dian Finest, who received a full-time call from the audience.
"Do you remember the answer?
Did you leak the documents?
Ah, uh, what.
No, no, I wait - it was really the bad body - the worst body I've ever seen."
Labor is not a free-minded organization now.
It is not tolerated here by those who say what is in their minds.
When the staff of the party in my area blamed me for my vote, it wasn't a surprise.
Because your mind will not be welcomed by Bola's nature - I was the last Labour MP to inform the list.
My parliamentary colleague, Juan Ryan, received the same treatment because he stood up against Judaism with determination.
In my case, I was found guilty of disagreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
Regarding the importance of a responsible economic policy, about European and national protection and similar issues, on which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
Friday, Notingham stated in a notice for the East Labor Meeting that "we want to include and promote meetings."
In my eight years as a local Labour MP, this is the first time that the GC meeting was held at the night.
Unfortunately, today, it is not the tune of the meeting, and is forgotten for the long time of the promise of "please, gentle" politics, if it ever begins.
It has been increasingly evident that dissent in the Labor Party is not tolerated and each opinion is judged as whether it is acceptable to party leadership.
It started soon after being a Jeremy leader, who I thought I had been thinking of the same political views as they began to expect U-Tern to take on me and to take a position that I would not be willing to accept - whether national security or the EUU is a single market.
Whenever I speak openly - and although nothing comes to what I say - there is a call to remove me by social media, the politics of the center, and I am told that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And this is not just my own experience
In fact, I know that I'm more fortunate to some of my colleagues because the comments in my terms are also political.
I am surprised to see colleagues who face the storm of discrimination or racial violence daily but never feel ashamed of their professionalism and determination.
The most disappointing aspect of this era of politics is how the scale of Galgali has become natural.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the Labour Party should develop the culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer a free-minded organization, and that each of the "unique" votes or changes in the election rules are narrowed by the party.
Over the last two years, many of me have been suggesting that I keep my head down, not so loud and that I'll be "right"
But I've come to politics, not to do this.
When I joined the Labour School as a schoolboy 32 years ago, we were provoked by the negligence of the government which literally destroyed our extensive school classrooms, then I tried to provide the necessary public service that was necessary — whether it was the local council or the government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, including the last election.
None of the Ningham East's policy position and the fields of disagreement with the current leadership were confused at all.
For those who promoted this movement Friday, I would only say that when the country was moving towards a brakes that would damage the family, business institutions, and our public service leaders, I did not understand the intention to waste my time and energy.
However, it is not a message to me really, whether or not to my electoral centres, whether or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that any non-partisan threat or political zeal will prevent me from saying the best interests of all.
Chris Lesley Notingham is an MP to the East.
Ayr 38-17 Meloz: Rise of Unrestrained Income
Lately, two attempts can reduce the gap between the final results, but no doubt the great entertainment puller of the day was eligible to win the revenue at the premiership of the premiere.
They are now the top of the table, the only uninfected group in ten.
In the end, it was their best defense, just as good as their chances were, which helped to win the welcome team and that coach Peter Murchi had the appropriate reason to be happy.
"We've been tested in every game so far and we're still unsatisfied, so I have to be happy."
Robin Christie of Melrooz said: "Air has to give credit, they have taken their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute attempt, converted by Frazier Clemo, led to the advance of the revenue, however, a yellow card by Scotland's player, Rory Hughes, which expelled him for the game by Wariers, gave him the majority, and the Jason Bagtt.
The goal in the Clemmo Penalty increased the lead of the Ayer, just prior to him, during the Halftime season, he scored 17–5 in a single effort.
Melros started the second season, however, and Patrick Anderson's attempt to convert the gap into five points.
It was then that the long-term game for the Ruwrid Nott, who went on to become a stutterer and went further with the income after the game was resumed by St.ford McDonalval's efforts, which was converted by Clemo.
Ayr's heavy captain Blair McFarson then received a yellow card then and again, after a severe pressure, Melroozze Bruce Colvine was sentenced to extra player with the income.
Although the welcomer Ray returns right, and when Stualan Schneinson sees the yellow card to deal with Clemo without the ball, the penality pulls out of the line and leads McFarson to the income mall.
Again, Clemmo converted, Kyle Ro, when David Armstrong's box kick Bogdaba, and was sent out for the fifth try of the home side of the Flecker Greg.

'The Sea is ours': Landland Bolivia hopes the court will open the way again to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors are patrolling a relaying Naval headquarters in La Paz.
The public buildings are flying an ocean-black flag.
The navals from Lake Titaka are decorated by the maintagonists: "The sea is our right"
It is a responsibility to recover "
As far as Bolivia as the land is concerned, the memory of the coast is still clear to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the nineteenth century - as well as another flight to the Pacific Ocean.
These expectations are likely the highest in the decade, as Bolivia is awaiting the decision of the International Court on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has that speed, unity and mutual consciousness, and of course we are expecting results with positive views," said Bolivian diplomat Ronald Caldila.
Many Bolivians will see the large screenings across the country, hoping that Heg's Trinoal Bolivia's claim would go on to support the claim that after decades of appropriate negotiations, Chile would be forced to discuss a sovereign outlet in the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's Census Indigenous president - who will face a controversial fight for the next year's re-election, also depending on the verdict of Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised in late August.
However, some analysts feel that the court does not have the possibility of deciding in favour of Bolivia - and that if it happens, it will be little less.
The Netherlands-based UN organization does not have the ability to provide Chile to the mainland and states that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The ICJ's verdict indicates only six months after hearing the final argument, that the case was "not a single," said in the Chilean International Law expert Paz Zerette.
And it may also be left behind in the last four years than to advance the cause of Bolivia.
"The entry of the sea to the current Bolivian administration has hijacked," said Zerette.
The anti-war speech of Morass has been featured in any debut welcomes Chile, he said.
Bolivia and Chile may continue to talk until a phase, however, it will be very difficult to discuss later.
Two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1969.
The Representative of The Hague, former President Eduardo Rodriguez Vetzy, rejected the decision of the Court to be unusually fast.
Monday, Bolivia will bring an opportunity to "a great opportunity for the new era" and "to end the 139-year dispute with the benefit of the seismic benefit", who said.
Calzadila also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – is using the issue as a political fence.
"Bolivia will never leave the right to enter the Pacific Ocean," he adds.
"The opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past"
North Korea has said that nuclear disarmament will not come until the United States believes.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho said that his nation's nuclear weapons will not first be disarmed if they do not trust Washington.
He said on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called the United States to comply with the commitment made during a summit in Singapore.
His comments came when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompio, with North Korea Kim Jong-un, seems to have been on the way to re-responsibly renovation of the atomic diplomacy in Singapore for more than three months.
Rie said that it was a "pipe Dream" that continued the ban and the U.S. objection to the conclusion of the Korean War would endanger North Korea.
Washington is aware that Pyongyang may initially agree with the announcement without the process of noting the significant disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second conference.
However, there is widespread suspicion that Pyongyang is serious about leaving a weaponhouse, which the country is likely to be the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pampo wants to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the 2nd Kim-Trump Conference.

John Edward: Language Skills are essential for world citizens
The independent schools of Scotland have maintained a track record of academic superiority, and in 2018 it continued the results of a more unprecedented test, only by the efforts of sports, arts, music and other communities.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (CIS) try to provide their students and parents with the best level service.
The individual schools are more and more for their students, their choice careers and their place as world citizens.
As an educational field that can design and implement a special school curriculum, we see modern languages as popular and preferred.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a person that he knows, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language it goes to his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we can't just rely on English if we want to create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year's experiment, we can see that the league tables with the highest pass rate in the language individual schools.
A total of 68% of foreign language studies students scored in higher grades.
Retrieved from the school of 74 members of SCIS, 72% of students achieved higher grades in Mandarin, while 72% of the students studied in German, 69% of French studies, and 63% of the Spanish studies.
It proves that the independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Language is now, as a choice, the curriculum of individual schools and somewhere else, and the same as STEM issues (in science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
A study by the UK Commission for Empress and Sketch 2014 found that the reason for employers to fight the zero, 17% attributed their language skills to the lack of efficiency.
So more, the youth are becoming essential to preparing language skills for their future career.
For more potential work opportunities that need languages, these skills are essential in the world.
Anyone who chooses a career, if they learn a second language, will have a real advantage in their future career skills.
Being able to communicate directly with overseas people automatically keeps a multi-purpose person before the competition.
In 2013, Ugov, over 4,000 adults, according to the survey, 75% of them were not able to speak well in any foreign language during the conversation, and the French language was the only language in the decade-century period, 15 percent.
This is why investing in language education is important for today's children.
There are multiple languages, especially in developing economic languages, to give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
Between Scotland, each school will separate them in the language they teach.
Several schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while noteing 2020, others will write the most important languages in the U.S. favor, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a lot of language to choose the individual schools, including specialists.
The Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a educational environment that will prepare children and create them with the necessary skills to succeed in the future.
In the global business environment, it cannot be denied that the languages play an important role in the future of the country, so it should reflect on education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be considered as "the skill of international communication."
The individual schools will provide these choices, diversity, and origins for young people in Scotland.
It is necessary.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.

During Trump's West Virginia rally, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump stormed the night campaign rally at Wheeling, West Virginia.
It was the first of five tiffsil gatherings in Trump's next week, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
In order to meet the zero level of the Supreme Court, the Trump has been in support for the next mid-Maydi election, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress in November.
What's the time for Trump's West Virginia gathering tonight and how do you see it online?
Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia gathering is scheduled at 7 pm, ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can view the West Virginia rally below Trump via Live Stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address the hearing of the Supreme Court's nominated candidate Bret Cavana this week, which has been plagued by allegations of sexual abuse with an expected Senate's confirmation vote during the FBI investigation.
However, the opening goal of these gatherings is to help the Republicans achieve a bit of speed facing the November elections.
In this way, President Trump's expedition said that the five-dimensional missions in the following week were "to force and support supporters, as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority under the Senate and Representatives," Reuters said.
"Congress control is so important to his fellow that we will travel as much as possible as possible to the busy campaign season," said a campaign spokesman to Reuters.
In the Wheeling A is determined by Wesbenko arrayner, today's gathering "can bring fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and bring coverage from Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Trump visited West Virginia on Saturday for the second time since last month, the state that he won over 40 percent in 2016.
In front of the Trump election, West Virginia is trying to help Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisy, who is behind the survey.
According to Reuters, West Virginia University politician Simon Heather said, "It's not a good sign for Maurisy that the president should try to encourage him to run further in the election."
Rider Cup 2018: The hunger to keep the hope alive at Sunday's single class is shown by Tim USA
The Rider Cup was required at the end of the three-dimensional session on Saturday afternoon.
The obituary of the Momentum is a complete sporting concept but the players really believe in it, and the highest in the national competition.
Then where are they gonna tell me now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so I think we've got a little mottum now," Jordan Speith told us to walk for the day.
Europe has advantages, of course, with more than twelve more games ahead of four points.
As Spyth said, the Americans felt that they had some assistance on their way and that they could be encouraged by many, particularly the form of Spoith and Merchant Thomas who played together all day and they both took three points from four to three points.
Speith was fatal from the beginning to the end and led from the front.
He was louder in celebrating his round, when he and Thomas were back on two points after two scores, making the four-point match an important pass.
The one he had won in the match on 15th was the same scream that he told you that he believed that the American team was not out of it.
"You really have to go deep and think about your own match," Spoith said.
Everyone in this player has it now.
18 holes to make a mark.
Over the last two days more than Spyth and Thomas, the player is only the French cycscisco paleari and Tommy Flattwood, the shallow story of the Rider Cup.
The strangest of Europe but the Auror Judicial can't make a four-and-four and no mistakes.
"Mollywood" was the only pair who did no brigade on Saturday afternoons, but on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoon and Friday morning, avoiding boggy on the back of the nine o'clock.
The run, and the way their powers flowd from the crowd and flowd from the crowd, it seemed like they were the players who were defeated on Sunday, and Le Golf National with the setting of the sun, and there were no other possible players to seal the European victory without the Flintwood or the Monetary.
It's better if both are in different holes at the same time.
Although European glory goes from time to time.
During the pairing with Alex Norren, Bubb Watson and the Web Simpson Morning Morning Fourball hero Serge Garcia had some trouble with the team.
In the first nine, a Boggy and two double Spaniards threw Sweeard and Sweedy into a hole where they never got up.
Sunday, though, there's no one to get you out of your hole.
The mutual correlation of the pair, the advice they do not offer, and the strategy that can easily change, is very interesting to see the fourballs and the Forsam from nearby.
Europe has played as a relatively good team so far and has taken an important lead in the final season, but this Forsam Session has further proven that Tim USA has a hunger for fighting, especially in the stateside.
On the final day of the Rider Cup, Europe took 10–6 lead
On the final day of the Rider Cup, on Saturday's Fourball and Foursam match, Europe will take the lead in the 10–6 gaps against the United States.
The enthusiastic pair, Tommy Flatwood and Francesco Mossary, took them to the Golf National with a two-time victory over the Tiger Woods.
Thomas Zerborne's European team, two years ago, was bred to recover the lost Tropical Tropical Tropical Tropical, to blow up the broken American side in the morning.
America won two matches, offering further resistance to the Forsam, but did not meet the shortage.
In order to recover the trophies, Jim Furick's team needs eight points from the 12 single matches on Sunday.
The four-pointed Flatwood is the first European rookie and the murky, together with the "Maliwood" "Marywood" in a remarkable season, from the first four points to four points in the history of the Cup.
Woods and Patrick were thrown into the 4th in the fourbles, and they were then jailed heavily by Superblades to defeat a lost Woods and the American Ruske Bryric Bryson Dekambio more strongly than 5 and 4.
On Saturday, the Woods, dragged himself into the two matches, sometimes caused a flash of light, but he now lost to 19 matches in his Fourball and the 29 matches in the Forsam.
Stan Rose, resting for Morning Fourball, returns to the Forsam partner Henryk Steinson and Brooks Cooper 2 and 1 in the World One and Three in the World.
A pleasant, wind day in the southwestern part of Paris, although it was not in Europe on its own.
Three main champions of the three-times Jordan Speith and Thomas placed a scale for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won 2 and 1 strong win against the Spain Zone Ram and Jan Polter in Four, and came back to defeat two of the openings in the Foursam and Rerry McColer in 4 and 3.
In the history of the Rider Cup, a team returned from four points to singles, although it was only required for the draw to recover the Tropical Tropical Tropical Tropical Trophy as a present.
After being the second best for two days, however, the Sunday counter attack seemed to be going beyond them.
North Korea has said that "no way" will be abolished without faith.
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the existing sanctions are deepening the U.S. disbelief and that there is no chance that the country has to release its nuclear weapons in such a national situation.
In the annual General Assembly of the Ri Young Ho global organization, North Korea took a remarkable wishful approach to stop nuclear and missile testing last year, breaking the nuclear experiment, and not promising to increase nuclear technology and nuclear weapons."
"But we don't see a similar reaction in the United States," he said.
"There will be no confidence in our national protection in the United States, and we have no choice to destabilize in this national situation."
Although North Korea's complaints against the retrospective of the nuclear disintegration in Washington were described as being a slow step in North Korea, his statement was significant because he did not allow the nuclear subjugation to be completely out of control, since Pyongyang had also done it in the past.
In the first meeting between U.S. president and North Korean leaders in Singapore, Kim Jongen and Donald Trump mentioned a joint statement that Kim had promised to work on "the nuclear impairment of the island of Koirier" and when Trump confirmed North Korea's protection.
North Korea is looking for a formal end to the 1950–53 Korean War, but the United States said Pyongyang must first leave his nuclear weapon.
Washington also resisted calls to lax international sanctions on North Korea.
They also objected to the announcement of "The United States "Perfectization-First" and the pressure to achieve their objectives with obligations, even against the announcement of the end of the war," as Ri.
"The Orders may risk us on the ground, the idea of those who don't know about us is a useless dream".
However, the problem H'L continued sanctions deepen our disbelief."
There was no comment on the plans of the second summit between Ri Kim and Trump, which was first featured in the United Nations during the week.
In the last five months, Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Zain, had a three-time meeting between Kim and South Korea, stating: "If the issue of the marriage of the observatory had been taken by the US to South Korea, it wouldn't have been so destruction of the Korean Peninsula."
Nevertheless, the tune of R's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Council that the mainland of America was inevitable as "Meville President" Trump called Kim a suicide suicide "Right Man".
In this year's UN, Trump threatened to destroy "fullly" North Korea last year, he praised Kim for his courage to take over the unarmedness, but said that many work still needs to be done and that the bans would remain intact until North Korea was abolished.
Wednesday Trump said that there is no time for it, he said, "If it takes two years, three years or five months to do it, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argued that Pyongyang should be rewarded for the move taken by the U.N. Security Council.
However, the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompio told Americans that Thursday: "The protection council should continue effectively and effectively until we fully investigate the final dissertation."
Security Council in Pyongonging's Department of Defense increased the bans on North Korea since 2006 to stop funding on nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompio met with Ree at the United Nations General Assembly in Ember and later said that he would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second conference.
Pompo had already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not good.
He said in July that some progress was made, only a few hours before North Korea condemned him "like the Guandas"!
North Korea promised a missile site at the meeting with Moon this month and a nuclear complex to break down if the United States "takes the system."
He said that Kim had asked him to seek "responsible action" that was the protection guarantee of Trump Singapore and that he had been leading to the safety of Washington to normalize the relationship.
Harvard students are taking a course of adequate rest.
This year, a new course at Harvard University is giving the students a more sleepable way to cope with the growing culture of the night-olds. "
A academic found that the world's number one university is often confused with the very early issues of how students will care for themselves.
This course was created by Charles Cizila, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and expert at Brigade and Women's Hospital, who believed it was the first time in the United States.
After giving a lecture about what had effect on the lack of sleep, he received inspiration to start the course.
‘ At the end of this, a girl approached me and said: ‘ Why have I been told this so long, coming to my senior year?'
He said that anyone who never told him about the importance of sleep - something that surprised me, 'He was telling the Telegraph.
The course that started for the first time this year helps students to develop good habits of sleep academics and the Athletics Permans, and to improve their general health as well.
The Harvard Medical School's Psychology Professor and Executive Director of the University of Health, Paul Baraira, said that the university decided to launch the course after the students had been seriously deprived of sleep during the recent week.
The one hour long course contains a number of intersected tasks.
A section has a student dormitory view, where students will know about the effects of calyphin and light by clicking on coffee cups, screens, and books, and how the athletonic performances will be affected by the lack of sleep and the importance of a Bedtime routine.
In the other section, the participants are told how long sleep can increase the risk of strokes, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of campus including an interactive icon, then the participants were encouraged to think about their daily routines.
'We know it's not going to change students' behavior immediately
However, we believe that they have the right to know – as your decision to smoke your cigarettes, there is also the right to know the impacts on the health, "Professor added CJilla".
He says the culture of pride is still alive, saying, due to increasing pressure on modern technology and students, Banchana is a growing problem.
You should be a student's 's secret weapon' to fight your well-being, fatigue, and anxiety, he says - even the sleeping brain makes them hungry, constantly hungry."
The 19-year-old Raymond Soe, studying Chemical and Physical Biology in California, also helped to design the course by Professor Sisillar, who also took a class during his first year in Harvard last year.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to a campus-wide course.
In the next step, he is hoping that all graduate students will ask for a study program to complete before attending competitive institutions.
Professor Sizila recommended that students be considered to have a reminder for when to go to bed and when to wake up, and that the "black light" flowed through the Bedouin screen and the LED light should be aware of the effects of the 'black light' effect that could cause you to die, causing a sleepout of the sediment.
Gladon 1 – 0 Rangers: defeating the Shires of the Manger Goaler Zerard.
The Rangers saw a loss in another Away match due to the defeat of Steven Gerard's random team near the end of the 1–0 gap.
After a 4–1 win in St. Johnston in February, the Ebrox team was looking at another win, however, Gary Thorne's team gave Gerard's second defeat as manager in the 18th match, which led him to the top of Leedbrürk's championships at eight points.
Menga was hit seven minutes before the half-time season, but the Hopeless Rangers line-up was never able to give them a tap.
Rangers have now moved down to the sixth place, in the third place, and behind the goal difference.
And there can be more trouble for Rangers because the lineman Calam Spencer had to be treated for an object that had not been taken to the Away border.
The Gerard team also made eight changes that led to the semi-finals of the Ayer's Top Betfried Cup.
On the other hand, Tasmania went along with the same Livi 11 which took a point from the Hearts last week, and was supposed to be proud of the way his inflammatory team was inhaling the opponent.
The Rangers may have control over the force but the Louisianans did more with their balls.
Mengar sent Scott Pittman in the first season of Le-of-Alan McGriger and they should have scored only two minutes but the Midfielder lost his big opportunity.
Keghan found a long free-key captain in Jacobs, Creg Halockt, but his defense partner Alan Lithgo managed to beat the ball only in the back post.
The Rangers rehabilitated control, however, was much more than the belief of their game in the finals.
Alfred Morlos certainly felt that he should have received his penulty in the quarter-Award due to the conflict of his and Steven Laules, but the mechanic Steven Thompson dismissed the request of Columbia.
Rangers could only target two shots at the first, however, former Ebrex goalkeeper Liam Kelli Culsali had little trouble with head and OV Egeria's shot.
Livier's 34th-minute opening goal may have been against the flow of the game, but no one can deny that they were the one to play their designer.
Once again, Rangers failed to handle Jacobs' dept set-up.
Scott Arfield was not reacting to the ball slot of Dekan Galer Scott Robinson, making his head cool to choose Menga for general Finnish.
Gerard took a turn at the break with Ryan Kent and this change was going to work almost immediately as the Wengerty was in Moreles, but the extraordinary Kelly left him on the block from the line.
However, the Chelsons began to play the same game that they enjoyed, sending long balles after the Lithgo and Halocket long-term ball.
The thirteen team could also move on to their lids at the end, but he stood up to ruin the efforts of McGons before he could head the corner of Lithgo.
Thomson once again turned back to demand Glenn Middleton, the substrate of Le Penaltis claiming to be with Jacobs.
Almanac: Archaeologist of Guygar Counter.
And now is a page of our "day of Sunday" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, the day the physics scientist Johans Wilhelm was born in Germany.
Gagar developed a method for identification and measurement, a invention that eventually became known as the Gagar counter.
Since then, a major basis for science, Gagar counter has also become a core of a pop culture, in the 1950s "Bals of Corona", seemingly potentially potentially potential observatory scientist Roy Rogers and Del Evans:
Man: "What's that?"
Rogers: "It's a Gaeger counter, is used to identify radioactive minerals such as Idea.
When you give these yearphones a bride, you can hear the effects of radiation provided by radiation in minerals."
Evans: "That's a lot of words what you're saying?"

Kitt Harington HBO's aggressive medieval fantasy series game of Throns is known for the combative role as Zone Snow.

Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the growth of Toxic Masculini for its very male character.
He added: 'What are we born, and what are we learning?
What is taught on TV and on the street that the boys seem to have to follow the specific course to be men?
I think it's really one of the biggest questions of this time - how will we change it?
For some of the youth there was a greater error .

HIV / AIDS: China has released 14% growth in new developments.
China has announced the growth of 14% in the number of HIV and AIDS victims.
There are more than 8200,000 affected people in the country, health officers said.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases were caused by sexual infections, from past events.
Traditionally, HIV infection spread quickly in various parts of China to perform blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way is almost zero, in a conference in Yunnan Province, Chinese health officers said.
Although there are over 100,000 people living in China, including HIV and AIDS, there is a growing number of people.
HIV infection through sex is a severe problem in the LGBT community of Chinese.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people was still considered unsatisfied.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70–90% of males have sex with men, they later marry women.
Many infections come from insufficient sexual protection in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV as part of the efforts to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters GP denies the data leaks of senators, 'bigly false' and 'experience theory'
On Saturday, the United States denied the allegations that a member of his staff was posted on the Wikipedia page of three Republican senators who had posted personal information from the United States Senators.
The Los Angeles Democrats strongly claimed that these claims were aired by "Altra-right Wing" scholars and websites.
"The Lies, Lies and More Hate," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The data is known as the home address and phone number of U.S. Senators in the United States, Senator Lindsay Graham in South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orin Hach, both U.S. Senators.
On Thursday, the information was published online, with an unknown person posted in Capital Hill during the hearing of the Senate panel hearing of the allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court candidate Bret Cavana.
The leak came shortly after the three senater cavna was sued.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Scholars and Redstate have reported that the IP address of the post was linked to the "Watters" office, and that Waters released any member of staff information, Hill reported.
"The false accusations are entirely false and a perfect lie," the Waters continue.
"My staff members - who identify, personal information and protections under these fraud and false charges - were resolved - in no way was responsible for the leak.
These false accusations are entirely wrong and a perfect lie."
The statement by Waters was quickly criticized by many online, including the former press secretary for the White House.
"This denial is angry," Flaysher wrote.
"It says he does not have the tendency to become a member of the Congress".
Don't be angry when someone is accused of what they have not done.
They must not be defendants.
They should not question the purpose of the accused.
They must be quiet and healthy."
He was comparing the reactions of the Democrats about Judge Cavana's criticism of the Democrats, Flisher, critics thought he was very angry during the Thursday hearings.
Republican candidate Omar Navaro, who is electing Waters in the mid-election election, also published his own opinion on Twitter.
"It's big," he tweets.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had warned "the authorities and the law enforcement agencies about these fraud claims."
"We will make sure that the criminals will be released," he continued, "and that any member of my staff and all members of my staff will be subjected to destructive and dangerousness for all members of their work."
Johnny English Stirks Agene Review - Poor Roanoke Atkins Intelligence
It is now traditional to see the brakes of any new image, including the British tributary, and it seems to be a renovation of Johnny English Action-Componsored Species, which was introduced in 2003 by Johnny English and returned to life in 2011.
Clearly, how many of the junkies will we have a chance of being the new Raftani?
In any rate, pop-faced, rubber-sided disabled Johnny English has a license to create new things for the second time — rather than anything else, his name indicates that he is a broad comic for other languages than English.
He must have contributed to a note in the 2012 Olympic opening ceremony Sharons of Fire Theme in London, despite the absurdity of the smoothly decorated, Mr. Bin's a dashing, and a Dop's opening ceremony in the 2012 Olympics.
He was originally based on the traper, and the man of international mystery, Atkinson, once a forgotten Barakacard starring in the TV ads, spread chaos in the physiology.
This last Jaying has one or two grand moments.
I'd like to see Johnny English in a helicopter in the dressing of the medieval armour.
The gift for physical comedy shows Atkinson, however, the joke was very low and inexpensive, especially the "Syrian" film brand, like 007 and Mission Implicit, is now a joke with confidence.
The joke seems to have been aimed at the children rather than adults, and to me, Johnny English's strangeest accidents are not as innovative and not as innovative as the silent-in-Cinemar of Atkinson's personality.
The long-term basis is the Great Britain has been in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker broke into Britain's highly classified web network, in order to introduce the identity of all Britain agents in the field, to disappointed the responsible agent - a sad small role for Kevin Arnold.
It is the last hope of a Prime Minister who has already been experiencing a complete crisis of politics, having been in a state of philanthropic and boundable personality: Emma Thompson performed his best with this semi-tresa-me, but there is nothing to do with the script.
His detectives told him that each active spy had been negotiated, so he had to get someone out of retirement.
And it means that Johnny English, who is now appointed as a school teacher in some back-class institutions, is taught outside of the record: there are some good jokes here, as English offers the school of the Rock-type Academy.
Ben Miller returned to the White Hall for Emergency Brilfing, and reunited with his former long-long-driven sidekirk Bauer.
Baue is now a married person, married to a submarine commander, a jolly-hki-stick role in which Vickin is somewhat wasted.
Therefore, the Batman and Robin returned to action to deal with a serious mistake at the Majesty's Secret Service and faced the Biography Women of Ophmnico.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister, Celebratory, is becoming dangerous in the Magic of the Billions, claiming that he could solve the problems of Britain's computer: Jack Lacey was a convicted sinner Jason Celebra.
English and Buu started the strangeest word of their debut high-jink: They caught a flash in a French restaurant disguise; they snuffed themselves on the luxury boat; and they began fighting in the Vukner's luxury boat; and the virtual sediment to make use of the headsets to make themselves known to the home of the English genus.
All stops must have been pulled out for the final sequence, however, as well as in the event, the whole thing has a bit of children's TV.
Very medium staff.
And I couldn't even think of myself as other Johnny English films: the British film industry is not going to give the life of the Miguel Atkinson as a role that really justices for his talent?
Labor denies that it is planning to work four days a week in favour of Briton but will pay for five days.
Jeremy Houn's Labour Party will consider a key plan that the British will work for four days a week - however receiving wages for five days.
The group, according to the report, wants the organizations to share money to the staff through an extra-day holiday by artificial intelligence revolutions.
It will see employees enjoying three-day holidays - but still make the same payhouse.
Sources said that the idea with the party's financial program would be "feet" and plans to move the country to favour the workers.
As a way of allowing workers to take advantage of the changing economy, the trade union Congress approved a four-day transfer of a four-day week.
A senior source of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It will not happen overnight, but a four-day career is a desire that is compatible with the team's ability to balance the team's overall industrial strategy in favor of the party's policy.
It was the first nine Labour Party to support the national idea, Green Party promised four days of work during their 2017 general election campaign.
The desire is currently not supported by the Labour Party, though.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: 'A four-day career party is not policy and it is not considered by the party.'
In the Shadow Chancellor John McDonnel used the Labour Conference last week to express his views on a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to turn power away from the "non-director" in subsidiaries and "lovers".
The plan of the Shadow Chancellor meant that the current shareholders of water agencies could not get their entire section back because the Labour Government could give some "bad" of the wrong doings.
He also confirmed plans to keep staff at the organization board and create the ownership funds for the staff of the private sector, with an annual sum of 500.
Lindsay Graham, tell John Kennedy "60 minutes" whether the investigation of the Cavana FBI could change their minds.
Judge Bret Kevana's final vote on his nomination in the FBI Supreme Court has been delayed for a week, and the Bureau's investigations have raised questions about whether any Republican senators can turn their support around.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 minutes" correspondent Scott Paulelli asked Republican Senators, John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham whether the FBI could discover something that led them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I told you to go to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavana.
After the incident I called her, the complaint came out, saying, 'What did you do?'
He was determined, undefeated."
Graham's vote, of course, seems constant.
"My Bachet is a mind about Kavana and will require a major charge to change it," he said.
"The Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett denied it strongly," Christine Blassey added Graham to Ford.
"And the man he called could not verify.
It's 36 years old.
I can't see any new changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and did it do to reduce poverty?
This Saturday will be the Global Citizen Festival in New York, an annual music event that has a magnificent line-up in the stars' Parformans and an equally impressive mission; the end of the world's poverty.
In the seventh year of its seventh year, Global Citizen Faculty Jackson, Cardi B, and Sean Mendes will only see thousands of people travelling to the Great Lawn in Central Park, but not so to raise awareness of the real purpose of the event to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The 2012 Global Citizen Facility is an expansion of the global poverty project, a group of people hoping to increase the number of people who are actively involved in the fights of the international media.
To obtain a free ticket for the event (if you are not willing to pay for the VIP ticket), the concerters have had multiple works, such as volunteers, to email a call, to call, or to help raise awareness about their goals in order to raise awareness about the purpose of the end of another poverty.
However, how much success did the Global Citizen make for the remainder of his goal?
Is the idea of being rewarded by concerts in which it is the real move to persuade people to take action, or is it another case in the so-called "competitiveism" - where people think they are signing or sending a tweet online?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has said that it has recorded more than 19 million "work" from his fans, moving to achieve various goals.
It says that these measures have helped world leaders to declare the most equal commitments and regulations that would affect the lives of 2.22 billion people by 2030.
In the early 2018s, the team cited 390 commitments and announcements that began from its activity, including at least 10 billion dollars already being distributed or funded.
The team's speculation that the protected funding has yet to be directly affected by the population around 649 million worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include the Power of Newtification, the partnership of the UK-based investors and the implementations of "to support their full potential", the commitment to supply Randa to the county after receiving more than 4,700 tweets.
"With your help to the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizen we can turn the social injustices into a footnote of history," said the Ambassador of the Power of New York during a power concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that after more than 5,000 measures were taken to the United States to improve breast and children's nutrition, the government announced a project, the Power of the New Testament, which would reach 5 million women and children in the nutrition intervention.
In response to a frequent question asked on its website, "What do you think we can end the extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: "This will be a long and solid way - sometimes we will fall down and fail."
However, unlike the great civil rights and anti-racism movements before us, we will succeed because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Sean Menends, Cardy B, Janel Monny will be one of those who will perform this year's performance in New York, which will run by Debora-Le Farnes and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. can use the Navy to "responsibly" the Navy in order to disrupt the U.S.'s fuel raffini - interiorschib
In order to prevent Russian fuels from coming to countries in the Middle East, Washington could take refuge in his Navy, the United States Internal Secretary Ryan Jinc, in the description of the Washington examiner.
Jink alleges that Russia's bonding in Syria - notably in which it is working on a legal government invitation - is an excuse to explore the new fuel market.
"I believe that their location in the Middle East is because they want to power like Eastern Europe, Europe's southern centre," he said.
And there is a way of taking action towards it, and the medium according to the Archbishops.
"We have the U.S. power to free the United States from sea courses and to block their fuel so that they do not go to the market."
Zink was speaking to participants in the event organized by a non-profit group called "The Voice of the Chemistry" in the United States.
He was comparing Russia and Iran in the same context as Washington's use to them.
"Russia refers to the card placed in the fossil fuel-based economy," he said, "Iran and Russia's financial alternative are less likely to receive and replace," he said.
The Trump Administration issued these statements during the goal of having a lot of cheaper liquidized natural gas exports for European customers in Europe.
With its influence, U.S. President Donald Trump, along with the Trump administration, tried to bar Germany from the "incorporated" Nord Stream II pipeline project, according to Trump, it is held in custody in Berlin Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly emphasized that the US$11 billion stream is the 2 pipeline that doubles the capacity of the existing pipeline, 110 billion cube meter, fully financed project.
The Kremlin's argument is that Washington's strong opposition to the project is nothing but financial and is an unrelated competition example.
"In my faith, we agree that it is not possible to be used as a tool of fuel pressure and that the consumers should have the ability to choose the supplier," said Russia's Minister of Energy Alexander Novak, after interviews with U.S. Energy Minister R. Rick Perry in Moscow.
As a result of the U.S. position, the negative reaction from Germany was re-established by the Germany Project.
In the industry, the German Federation of German Industry (BDI) told the United States to stay away from the European Union's Energy Policy and the bipolar agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"After the recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), we have a major problem with the intervention of a third state in our fuel supply".

Warren Town is the time when Presidentey Donald Trump expressed his opposition to the Trump, saying that Trump "is leading the country in the wrong direction."
"Donald Trump I'm so worried about what's going on with our democracy," he said.
Warren Trump and Trump's Supreme Court's nominated Bront Kavanawagh has come under criticism.
In a Friday tweet, Warren said, "Of course we need the FBI to investigate before voting."
In a study published Thursday, the majority of Warren's own voters did not think he should fight in 2020.
The University's Political Research Center / Boston Globe Survey stated that the Massachusetts "incorporation" was a majority of voters who said that the Senator should not fight in the vote.
Breast supported the fight-in-law.
In the survey, it is found that the support of former Governor Deval Patrick's vote is higher than the support of the 38% of the possible fight and did not support 48%.

1818 State, DC supports the challenge of the new asylum policy
The Eighteen states and District of Columbia are supporting the legal challenge against the new US policy which refused to provide shelter for the victims of gang or family violence.
NBC News reported that in order to support a asylum-production challenger, the representatives from the 18th States and District, filed a friend-in-law in the court on Friday in Washington, Washington.
The full name of the Bader case of Grace V. Sessions, which was filed in August against the American Civil Liberty Union Federal Policy, was not released.
He said that his Songy "and his violent gang member boys," had been beaten by him, but the U.S. officials refused to appeal to his asylum on July 20.
He was detained in Texas.
Attorneys of Grace's supported states cited El Salvador, Honduras, and Colorado as a country facing widespread gang and family violence problems, from which a large number of applicants came to the U.S. for shelter.
The new American asylum policy backed the decision of the immigrant appeal board of 2014 to appeal for asylum to the displaced immigrants who fled for domestic violence.
District of Colorado, Attorney General Carl Rein, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "has ignored the federal, federal, and international laws of the decade."
Friends - The Court Brif said that "all refugees should be judged according to specific information and circumstances, and that the national ban violates the original purpose."
In the statement, the Attorneys also argued that the denial of entry to immigrants was hurt in the U.S. economy because of the possibility of their entrepreneurship and that they were "giveing to the required labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions was ordered by the immigration judges in June to stop the victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Appropriation of the nation, religion, nationality, or certain social groups or of those who have left their own country to seek refuge in those who had left their own country," Sessions announced his policies on June 11.

I don't know what happened to him or my kids.
I hope they're safe."
The American Ambassador accuses China of "Galagali" by "Propaganda commercials".
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in the U.S. Daily, China's U.S. Ambassador accused of using the American press to promote intentional propaganda against Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the pedal Supplement of the National Chinese Daily of Iowa's largest Chinese daily Des Moins Register on Wednesday, and accused China of attempting to intervene in the U.S. Congress election on 6 November, China denied the allegations.
Trump was accused of attempting to intervene in the U.S. election in Beijing, which U.S. officials told Reuters a new attempt to pressure China.
It is natural that the foreign government will be advertising trade, but Beijing and Washington are currently in the trade war to increase the amount of importation to each other.
Chinese and U.S. experts have said that in the early days of the trade war, China's vengeful capitalists were designed to harm the RAFTNs in the state such as Iowa who supported the Republican Party of Trump.
China's U.S. Ambassador and former long-term governor, Terry Branstad, is a major Rafant of agriculture in China, said that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and merchants.
Branstrad wrote in a post on Sunday's des Mains Register, saying that China "was now double the brutality with the intentional adverts in our own independent press."
Branstrad wrote, "The Chinese government is taking immoral advantage of American culture and free press debuted history by advertising the promotional advertising in Doss Mines Register".
"On the other side, you will find limited opposition voices on the side of the Beijing street and you will not see the true reflection of Chinese people's disputes about Chinese economic pathways, as the news media has moved here to China's Communist Party's hand signs".
He also said that his writings "are denied a major newspaper print in China", although he did not mention the newspaper.
Prior to the Midtarm debate, Republicans were trying to keep women voters away, analysts warned
In the face of multiple allegations of sexual abuse by the Republicans, analysts have warned that they will be able to view its debut from women in the upcoming Midtime election.
Emotions around the issue have come to a close, and most Republicans are already trying to move forward with the vote openly.
In an article published on Saturday, Maxwell University's State Science Professor Grant Rihar told The Hill, "They can't come back."
Rihar said that in the last minute of the FBI investigation, the pressure of Senator Jeff Flick (R-Aprilna) will calm down the angry voters, doubting whether or not.
According to Whetton DC, the senior advisor to the progressive Muovon clan, and the National Women's spokesman, Carin Jin-Pierre, said Friday, "The women don't forget what happened - they are tomorrow and will not forget it in November."
Despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaezi Ford, the justice committee's decision to lead the Republicans to the nomination of the nominee of the Cavanf, protesters chanted "November coming" on Friday morning at the Senate Hallway, Mike said.
"Academic political analyst, Stu Rothberg, told the news site," would be the past of the democratic origin and inspiration.
"Loke tells that there's already too much; it's true".
However, it can be much more, especially among the women's Dhutli female voters in the city, and between the ages of 18 and 209, who often do not vote because of the President's choice."
Even before Ford publicly testified against the allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court's chosen candidate, analysts suggested that if Republicans were to proceed with approval, it could be a distaste of the disparities of the Republicans.
"It has become a complex issue for GeoP," earlier this week, former chairman of the Republican National Committee Michael Steel told NBC News.
"It's not just about whether the vote or the final vote of the committee or the case of Kafaf is to be held, how Republicans took the matter and used it with him", the Architects U.S. Group, who assists Democrats in voting, told their director, Gaysil News.
However, the Americans seemed to be slightly confused about who to believe in the testimony of Fords and Kavanf.
In a new study, Ugov found that 41% of the respondents are sure or likely to believe Ford's testimony, where 35% said they must either believe in Kavanoff.
It also appeared that 38% said that they thought Kavanoff was likely or of course false when he took his testimony, and only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After being pressured by the Hudson, the FBI is currently investigating another accused DeBoira Ramirez, the Guardian's report.
Ford testified in front of the judicial committee on the oath last week that Kavanf had made him debut at the age of 17.
Ramirez complained that the Supreme Court showed him his own sex in a party during Yale studies in the 1980s.
The creation of the World Wide Web with Google and Facebook plans to launch a new Internet.
The World Wide Web's sponsor Tim Berners-Lee launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Intrapt, is a company that will build the Burners-Ler's Open Source Platform Solid.
The solids users allow people to choose where their data will be stored, and in any information, they will have access to human access.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Le joked that the main purpose of the Intrapt is "world government".
"We have to do this right now," he says about the start.
"It's a historic moment".
The app allows everyone to create the P and D or "Personal Data Stores".
It may include the list, the Tu-du list, the calendar, the music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It is similar in the same browser as well as in the Google Drive, Microsoft Outback, Slick and Species.
The uniqueity of the personal online data store is that it will be completely dependent on the user—who can access information on a type.
The company called it "personal empowerment through Deter".
According to the organisation's CEO, John Bruce's ideas will help bring the resources, processes, and appropriate skills to achieve unity.
The organization is currently composed of a team of Berners-Le, Bruce, a protection platform purchased by IBM, some contracted non-reference developer and volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentral applications using the existing tool on the website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team would not be talking about a complete change with Facebook and Google in which the models of all their businesses would be completely changed overnight."
"We're not asking for permission from them."
In a post on the medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the Institute "is a commercial fuel and supply of commercial fuel to protect the integrity and quality of the new web on solids."
The World Wide Web Consortium was replaced by Berners-Le Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1954 and replaced the Internet with a radical change.
In the past few months, net neutrality has become a strong voice in the debate by Berners-Lee.
Even during the Interrogation, Berners-Lee World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the founder and director of the Open Data Institute.
"I'm impossible to expect on the web's next era," Burgess-Lie said.

Think you're up all night to see a great Bellator 206 and the main event wasn't shown.
The original bill from San Jose had 13 fights with six in the original cards and the entire night was live on channel 5 at U.S.
At six o'clock in the morning, when Gegard was preparing for Moussai and Rory McDonald to face each other, the coverage was shocked by the UK audience.

"But there is now Sunday morning six and our Sundays, we can't do this until Monday.
However we're working on it.
Believe me, there was a lot of messages when it was put on switches and they weren't very friendly.
We were trying to correct it, we thought it might be some technical mistake.
But no, it was official.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We'll lower it in five fights instead of six, as we usually do—the opposite happened to try to give the fan extra.
This is an unfortunate situation."

He also said that the idea of winning his Olympic win after the child's birth was reduced.
The long-term show regular host Christie Young took a couple of months off due to illness.
Being disfellowshipped in the first season of Love, Delie said that she felt "little" than the rest, because "the choice of children was not socially acceptable."
He said: "As of this day, the small feeling and feeling of individuality remain real that gave me the strength and determination to achieve success."
He said that he wanted to prove himself to be "one thing" so that when everyone knew about his sex, everyone wouldn't be disappointed.
The bronze medals in the two-time Olympics became the LGBT preacher, and in Australia the more commonwealth games this year have been able to apply his presence to recognize homosexuality.
He said he had opened his mouth because he felt lucky to live in the open without difficulty and wanted to give others "hope."
The three-time World Championship spoke of falling in love with a man – American film producer Dustin Lans Black, whom he met in 2013, "I was shocked."
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who was born from his age to 20 years, saying that the age gap was not a problem.
"When you're so young," he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later—he said that it was difficult to find someone who had so much to ride in life.
The couple gave birth to a son named Robert Ray Black-Delley in June and Daley said that his "full perspective" had changed.
He said that if he had asked me last year, ‘I have to win a gold medal' it was my meditation.
"Really, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals".
Ravi is my Olympic gold medal."
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 after being diagnosed with breast cancer.
Daley said that his father never admitted that he was going to die and finally asked if their tickets were confirmed for London 2012 – because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I didn't even say 'you're not going to be here to sit in the first row,' he said.
"I took his hand when he stopped breathing, and he left his last breath and died and I didn't admit that he was not incompetent," he said.
The following year Delie took part in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
He said, "This was the dream of my whole life - diving in the Olympics in front of my own audience, nothing better than that."
It was also inspired by his first song's choice – the Praud of the Hinder Coals – which he was in the preparation of the Olympics, and which still beat him.

Off-form Mikelson would sit on the bench on Saturday's Rider Cup.
American Phil Mikelson will make a record on Sunday playing his 47th Rider Cup matches, but if it doesn't want it, he will have to return his form if it doesn't have the unfortunate milestone.
Mikelson, who played at the record 12 times in the biberial event, instead of Capten Jim Furick, had to sit on the bench on Saturday's Fourball and Fours.
Instead of being in the centre of Halal, which he lived in in the United States, the five-time major champions had spent the day working in the Charyleyder and playing his game in the range, from the busy.
The top of the career is not always in the drivers, this 48-year-old Tight Le Galf is not fit for a course, where long-term sediment is often in trouble with a long shot.
And if the course isn't enough bad news for itself, in the Mikaelson, 9th match, the British Open Championship faces Francesco Molinary, who paired with Ruki Tommy Flatwood, won their four matches this week.
If the Americans, who are under four points at the beginning of the 12-years match, can begin well, prove to be important to Mikelson's match.
Furick showed confidence in him, although there was not much to say.
"He's got the whole sense of his own gemica today, holding my shoulder and saying he's ready for tomorrow," Furick said.
"Or has great confidence in himself".
He is one of the halls of Femer and the past and has also given much to the team this week.
I probably didn't think he was gonna play two matches.
I was hoping more, but that's what happened and we were thinking of going ahead.
She wants to get in the field, like everybody else."
On Sunday's match, Mikelson would go beyond Nick Faldo's record of the most Ryder Cup matches.
It can end up in the Rider Cup career which does not pass through its personal record.
In the Pack of Mikelson, 18 wins, 20 ratings, and seven halfs, though Furick said his presence was to revive the team.
"He's a funny guy, anemic, intelligent, loved people, like the team in the room," he said.
"I think the new players enjoyed playing with him very much this week, too, that was very nice to see.
He's more than just playing."
Europe Captain Thomas Schrern knows that the big lead can also disappear
Thomas Schrern, European Captain, knows from experience that the last day of the Bigs' Lead with Rider Cup can also be made up of uncomfortables.
Deon's self-determination took place in Valdarama in 1972, where the Savi Ballots' led team won five points to Americans, but only in the narrowst margin, the Finnish line reached 14111111.2722.
"You make yourself to think that we had a large lead in Valerama; in Brooklyn we had a large lead, where we lost, and in Valerama, where we won, but not only in the gap," Schrern said, in the film, showing him on Friday and Friday, and yesterday's two days to win the 5th class of Le Golf National.
History will show me and everyone in the team that this is not yet over.
Get off with full enthusiasm tomorrow.
Get down on the field and do the right thing.
It's not the end of the board until we get the point.
We have a goal, that is to try and win the Trophy, and we will have the eyes of birds in it.
I've always been saying that I look at the 12 players of my team, but we're very aware of who we are on the side – the best player in the world."
Bourrn also said that I am glad that our players did what they did in the difficult golf courses. "I will never be too proud to believe in this.
Tomorrow is a different fight.
Tomorrow the personal performance will come forward, and it is a different thing.
It's great to be with partners when all good goes, but when you're alone in the field, you have a complete test of your power as a suffriff.
This message is necessary to reach all players, who have to pay the best tomorrow.
This time, you have to throw your partner down to Ago and make the best of it."
In contrast to Schrborn, the opponent Jim Furick will have a vision of the player as a team that has personally played as a team, in an exception, Jordan Species and Simon Thomas, who brought up three points in four points.
As part of the winning team at Har and Brooklyn in Europe, Furk also experienced dramatic Pot-change experience as part of the final day.
On the last day of the 1919 season, he said that he wanted to know how Captain Ben Crane had raised his players, "I remember every word."
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'll want to get rid of a fast start like Brooklyn and Medina.
As the game turns to one side, there is a lot of pressure on the side of the match.
We'll build the line-up according to that and we'll put the boys down as we think, in fact we're trying to do some magic tomorrow."
Paul KC, Simon Rose, John Flatt, Tommy Flatwood and Ian Poulter were commissioned to lead Thomas against the Europeans in the opening match to Rory McLor.
"I have managed this group in this way, because it will cover everything in my opinion," Schnell tells him about the selection of his patients.
New German warship suspended again
Local news reports said that the German Navy's youngest team was scheduled to be introduced in 2014 for the replacement of the previous cold war-time warship, but due to the poor system and snowballing costs, it would not be until the next year.
In reference to the military spokesman, Diee Zeitt stated that the first ship to launch the Freegate's "Rainland-Faltz" was suspended to the first half of the first half of the first half of the population in the new Biden-Greemberg-Charge.
The ship was scheduled to be connected to the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project has been in trouble due to the delivery-up problems.
In 272, the Navy that ordered the four Batden-Gormberg-class ships would take place in old Bremen-class Frigent.
They are known to have strong cannons, anti-aircrafts and anti-ship missile, as well as some steel technology, such as the Riddeds Radar, Infrared, and Aquinastic Sigonic.
Other important features include a long maintenance period - the new freegates will be possible for two years away from the port of the country.
However, the constant delay means the h'all-driven battleships, which are supposed to help Germany in a foreign state of energy, will become old-time in water, Dye J.E.
The unfortunate F12 Freegate was titled last year, when the German Navy refused to launch the official ship, sending it back to the Bloom and Vos Shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that a ship returned to the Shipbillard after the Navy delivered.
Little known about the reasons behind the return, however, the German media referred to several of the most important "software and hardware errors" that would make the ship useless in the battle.
The software's gloves are particularly important, because the naval vessels of the Batden-Gormberg-class will be operated by the crew of around 120 sailors - which are half of the people of the old Bremen class freegates.
In addition, it appeared that the ship was heavy that would reduce its performance and prevent it from connecting the future of the Navy.
The 70,000 tons of "Rainland -Fallage" in the Second World War is believed to be twice as heavy as the same class ship used by the Germans.
Along with the underlying hardware, the cost of the whole project is also becoming a problem with the crew training.
The initial level reached an amazing $3.1 billion (3.6 billion) from a 2 billion pound.
In recent view of the threat of naval-power in Germany, the problematic new larvats have become more important.
At the beginning of the year, the head of the German Parliament's Defense Committee, Hans-Patter Bertels, admitted that "Motten's perfect ship is running out."
The official said that the problem was accompanied by time, because no subsidiary ships that had been dropped were brought to the old ship.
He laments that no fleet of the Baden-Gormberg-class was able to join the Navy.
Listening to National Trust in Bader's Secret Life
New research is being conducted in a estate in the Scottish suburbs to learn how to use landfalls to seek food.
It is hoped that the search will focus on the behavior of these unique flying creatures and help in future conservation activities.
The research of the scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will continue with general and soprano pipes, and also the Denton Baders of the Inavaru Garden of West Ross.
In order to track the activities of the entire Moosume battalions, special recorders will be set up in significant locations around the area.
The ongoing survey is also conducted using the NHS staff and volunteers to provide portable diplomats.
The sound of all recordings by the expert will be assessed by the batting of the batter and news of what a species is doing.
Then a Landscape Map and Report will be created to create a wide variety of landscapes and images of their behavior.
NTS' nature conservation consultant Robe hopes the results will reveal that any fields of habitat are the most important for the disintegration and how it is used by each species.
This information will help determine the usefulness of housing management, such as the creation of a well-being plant and how to protect forest fires and other related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has been extremely low throughout the past century.
They are in danger for building and development work which damages their sleepy places and habitats.
The air-based turbines and light can be dangerous, as may be some of the chemicals of flat paper and buildings, as well as the danger of the attack of pet cats.
The bats are not really blind.
However, their ears are more effective in hunting because of the hunting practice at night.
They use a advanced echo strategy to identify dangers and obstacles on the pathway.
The NTS, whose responsibility is to maintain the land of bats, is a total of 270 historic buildings across the country, 338 important parks, and 680,000 hectares of land.
They have ten trained experts who regularly conduct, visit sleepy places, and sometimes rescue.
The organization also established the first and only dedicated monumental site of Scotland in Damfretz and Gallo's Threev Estates, with eight houses within Scotland's ten-dimensional species.
Estate manager David Thompson said that this estate is the ideal area for the battalion.
"There's a good area for the Threeves Baders," he said.
"There are old buildings here, there are many ancient trees and all good habitats".
However, much more is still unknown about bats, so here and elsewhere the work we do will help us understand more about what we need to survive."
He emphasized the importance of knowing the presence of the land of land before maintenance of property, because it could be destroyed by the destruction of a matrix of a motherly and child, and that the whole local battalion could be destroyed.
It is illegal for battalions to protect and kill them, harassing, or disrupting their habitat.
The Scottish officer of the battalion Reserve Trust, Elizabeth Ferrell, is a source of inspiration to help the public.
He said: "We still have a lot to know about the stars and we don't know how many species live."
Ronaldo rejected the rape allegations and lawyers continue to bring a lawsuit against the German newspaper
He was accused of rape as "false news" and said that people wanted to "open" themselves with his name.
His lawyers are ready to sue the German news magazine Der Speggel, who made the complaint public.
The Portugal and Juvents Forward accused him of rapeing an American woman named Catherine Mazoga in a hotel home in Las Vegas in 2099.
He was accused of giving him $755,000 to keep silent on the incident, in Der Spiegel Report on Friday.
A few hours after the claim came to the public, his Instagram live video commented on his 33-year-old Ronaldo as a "false news".
"No, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," says Ballon-D's winner camera.
"In using my name, they want to expand their identity".
It's common.
They want to be known by my name, but it's a living organ.
I'm a happy guy and everything's going on." The player added in a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Species about the charges, which they called "incompetitive reports to be suspicious in secret."
Lawyer Christian Shertz said that the player "is to be responsible for the moral loss that is likely to be in serious violation of personal rights in recent years," asking for compensation.
The alleged incident occurred in a suit of Palms Hotels and casinos in Las Vegas, June 2009.
The Nevada Clark County District Court has filed papers that Ronaldo and Mayo went to the player's house after the appearance of a night club, where he was raped by Purga.
Mayo claimed that Ronaldo was humble after the incident and told her that he was "9% disappointed" for "one percentage".
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that they had sexed, but that it was agreed.
Mayo also claimed that he went to the police and was taken to the hospital, however, he agreed to settle outside the court because he was "surprisingly afraid of it" and was afraid of "discussing".
The young woman, 34, says she is now trying to raise the resolution because she is mentally upset because of the alleged events.
Ronaldo was in the midst of joining the Real Madrid from Manchester United during the crime and joined the famous club Juvel in Italy in this summer's 100 million contract.
Brasssite: loss of position as a car producer U.K. 'Critical Affirmation will regret'
Minister of Commerce Greg Clarke said his position in the world as the first place in the making of car after the breakout of the car was "to regret it" in the UK.
He also said that it was "inspired" that the UK told the BBC that if Britain releases the EU without any contract, they would temporarily stop production in the factory in Bernton, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the people's job could be lost due to the borderwide delays at the breakdown.
The factory of Burns – which produced Toyota Ornis and Avenis – produced about 1500,000 cars last year, approximately 90% of the remaining countries in the European Union were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain comes out from the EU at the end of March, there can be a stop at our factory".
Honda, B.W. and Jaguar Land Rover have expressed concern about leaving the European Union without any agreement.
For example, BMW said that they would shut down their mini plant in Oxford after a month of brakes.
The main concern that the car manufacturers are saying is the risk of supply chains in the field of the breakdown of the deal.
Toyoter's production line goes on "Jast-In-Time" based on the "Just-Time", the U.S. and both the U.E. and the U.S. have a sediment per minute.
If the UK releases the EU without a deal on March 2nd, the border can be interrupted due to delays in supplying the contrabands and the crisis of contrabands can be seen as a trade palace.
The organization said that more than one day in the Toyoter Derbya's plan can't be kept invertri for which production could be stopped.
Mr. Clarke said that Thresa May's Czechs' plans for the future relations with EU in the U.S. were "experienced to avoid this type of check."
"We need a contract, we want to do the best contract that will not only hold success, but it will also be possible to enjoy future improvement," said at BBC Radio 4 today.
"Not only the Toyota, but also the case of other correlators is evidence that the success of the chain is very important."
Toyota is unable to say how long it will stop, but they have shown that the long-term cost of factory competitions will reduce the capacity of the competition and may lead to many jobs.
For 24 years working in Burns, and the U.S. Union of the Plant said that his members were increasingly concerned: "In my experience, they never returned to work again.
A public spokesman said: "We need to have a specific and reliable plan for future relations with YU."
Rosenstein's meeting with Trump may be more delayed, according to the White House.
In the middle of the twentieth court with Nomine Bret Kavanoff, Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosestein said on Sunday that the high-level meeting could be "a week behind" with the White House.
Rosestein, Russia's intervention in the election, the involvement between Trump's associates and the possible barriers of the President in Russia and the work of investigators Robert Mueller.
Whether Trump will dismiss the Deputy Attorney General and whether Mueller's independence will be in question by means of him, this has been ongoing in Washington for the past few months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported Rosestein's use of secret Mike to record conversations with Trump and to discuss the possibility of removing the president with 25th amendments.
Rosestein denied the report.
However, he was reportedly reportedly on Monday in the wake of such a recurator, who went to the White House.
On Thursday, the meeting with Trump was announced, Trump was then in the United Nations office in New York.
Trump said that he "do not like Rosstein" to dismiss Rosenoff, however, is one of the women charged with sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasziz Ford, both taken testimony, the meeting of the Senate Department of Justice to avoid hearings.
Friday, Trump ordered a week of FBI investigations against Cavanoff, which had further delays in the full vote of the entire Senate.
Trump's press secretary Sara Sanders appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Regarding the meeting with Rosestein, she said: "It's not a date, it may be this week, it can only be a week behind all other current issues of the Supreme Court.
Let's show it and I'm always going to get the news."
Some journalists would oppose the statement, Sanders did no more in the White House after 10 September.
Schurch Chris Wallace asks for his reasons.
Sanders said that the reason for not keeping the buffeting is not "showing up" to journalists, although he said: "I don't deny that they did show up."
He then suggested extending direct communications between Trump and press.
"The current president held more questions than any of his previous presidents," he said without mentioning any evidence: "We have judged the number."
Brilfing will also be in the future, says Sanders, "But if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it's much better to talk to me."
We try to do this and you've seen us do it for the last few weeks and the state of press Brifing is going to take a direct place to talk directly to the President of the United States."
Trump takes regular questions while attending a press conference with prominent guests from the White House or during the opening session.
A single journalist conference is very low.
In New York this week, it is likely why the pressants, the uninfected work, and sometimes the dull appearances of the journalist team.

The entire European Union and beyond it, colleagues have brought valuable experiences and skills that have strengthened and improved health care and benefited patients and our community.
Scotland is your own country and we want you to stay here."

When foreign buyers buy a property in the UK, they have to pay more stamps
When foreign customers buy new property in the UK under the Toori Plan, they will have to pay more stamps and spend the extra money with the help of the homeless.
The move will boost the success of Corbin's expedition to attract young voters.
These stamps will apply to those who do not pay the taxes in the UK.
Treasury hopes that revenues will be made more than $1120 million per year to help the homeless.
When foreign buyers buy a property in the UK, they have to pay more stamps – and this extra money will be spent with the help of the homeless, Therasa will announce today.
The move will boost the success of Corbin's adventure to attract young voters as soon as they target high-income housing prices and high-incomes.
These stamps will apply to individuals and organizations who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the government's assistance with the help of overpaid homeless.
Sarpher—in addition to the current stamps, two years ago, a high rate of costing and renting of the second house could be more than three percent.
Treasury hopes that revenues will be available to →120 million a year.
About 13% of the new total property in London have been purchased by outsiders in the United Kingdom, which has increased prices and made the situation more difficult for the first housing buyers.
Most of the elite regions of the country – especially the capital – are becoming "infatuated cities" in the crowd of poor foreign customers living abroad.
The new policy came a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamps with their first home purchased by the younger generation.
He accuses large construction agencies of increasing property prices without making use of land and calling on Mrs. May to cancel the quota of property in Britain to solve "abusiness problems".
Mr. Corbin announced an interesting series of proposals for housing reform, including the end of rent control and "No-Fall" eviction.
He wants to give the Council more power to build new houses.
Mrs. May: "Last year I said that I would sacrifice my Prime Ministership to restore the British dream - that life should be more beautiful for everyone in the new generation.
And its meaning is to heal the broken home market.
Britain will always be open for those who want to stay here, work and create life.
However, it can't be decided that foreign and foreign private organizations who are not in the UK will easily buy property as easily as hard as the hardworking British residents.
Many are the dreams of ownership of the house for many people, and the problem of homeless remains very real.
Jack Ross: 'My Final Dream is to take the responsibility of Scotland'
Saunderland Boss Jack Ross said that his "temporary desire" is to become the manager of Scotland in the future.
The 42-year-old Scotland Nier, currently enjoying the challenge to restore the North-East club, now in third place in the League One, is behind three points from the first team.
He returned St. Chisum to the Scottish Premiership last summer to the Stadium of Light.
"I wanted to play for the country as a player".
I was getting a B cap and so far, "Ros told BBC Scotland Sports.
"But I grew up watching Scotland play with my father in Hamilton and it's always behind me.
If I succeed in managing the club, only this opportunity can come."
As a Sanderland manager, Ross has a Dick Advocate, David Moiss, Sam Elardis, Martin O'Neill, Roy, Gugu Pot, and Paulo de Cano.
The former Alla Athletics Boss said he did not feel a disappointment by rejecting the established name of the big club in Bernsley and Epunich Town.
"At this point the success scale will be to me 'Can I bring the club back to the Premier League?'
Due to the structure and benefit of the club, it is certainly worth the Premier League, "He says.
"It's not that easy to get there, but I'll probably see myself as a success if I could bring the club back there."
Ross's manager is only three years old, after having been operating in Dumbton and a coaching staff for 15 months as assistant bosses in Hartston.
He subsequently helped Alwa to regain the third level from the lower level and to convert St Mirren from the lower end of the road to the championship champion.
And Ross says that he is now more comfortable than a career in the Collegral, Harlpool, Falkark, St. Mirren, and Hamilton Academy.
He recalled the duties of Alwar, "It was probably a real milestone."
"I really believed that management is more suitable for me than sports.
It sounds strange to hear because I've done it right, I've been able to live somewhat and enjoy some success.
But the game's hard
You have to go through a lot of things every week.
I still feel the same way about work pressure, but the management seems right.
I've always wanted to do the job and I'm doing it now, it's the most pleasant thing in my own skin in my entire adult life."

The survey said Saturday afternoon is the most ideal for Pint.
The summer heat wave increased the crowd in the brigades of Britain, but the restaurants put it under pressure on the chain.
In July, the sales of the platinum and bars increased by 2.7%, however, statistics were published by 4.8% in the restaurants.
Peter Martin of CGA's business consultant company, who compiled the statistics, said: "The unexpected long participation of England in the sun and World Cup, would also have been the same trend as the previous June, when the sale of voltage was reduced to 2.8%, and the sale of restaurants.
In June, the restaurants suffered more than 1.8% of the decline in the business.
Drinks are the main ones and bars have been very good until now, and have been as bad as selling the restaurants.
The food mains are also suffering from heatfalls, but did not call them down like the restaurants.
It seems that people are just going out for one drink.
The sale of all vegets and drinks in the bar has increased by 6.6% this month, reducing the food sales by three percent."
The retired and hospitality analyst and S.M. Paul Neuman said: "The end of the class is still continuing.
The impact of weather and major social or sports events is the highest in the market on the sale of the house outside.
It is not surprising that the restaurants will remain in a difficult situation, but this 4.8% will be particularly painful on sales annually.
Food will not come from long and hot summer for the chief operator, and will say if the soft weather of August will be a bit comfortable."
In July, there was a total increase in sales in the newly opened and restaurants, which reflected a decrease in sales in brand Roll-outs.

The Internet is confused with the mother and cow compared to the cockpit pump
A cockpit pump organization has divided the opinion of the Internet with a advertisement to compare the breast feeding cow with the breast feeding cow.
In what is said "the first wordless pump in the world," the consumer technology organization LV released a fun music video advertisement in order to demonstrate the freedom the new pump provides to modern mothers.
Four real mothers danced with a barn filled cow, with Lyric in it: "Yes, I am, but I don't have a tail" and "If anyone sees it, they're not the left of an animal, they're my pets."
Koras continues: "Pamp it over and over again, pump it up, I feed the children, pump it up and do it again, I'm the milk of my girlfriends."
Although, the ad, which was released on the company's Facebook page, has sparked controversy online.
The video received mixed feedback from the audience on the 77,000 views and Shay Shay Soe comment, with many saying it illuminates the "fearness" of the milk industry.
"The use of beef in the product's advertising is very bad decision".
Like us to make milk, we need to be pregnant and give birth to a child, the difference that within the days of the birth is that their children are stolen from them," one wrote.

Another commented: "It's disappointing for Mom and Child Uvez.
But why don't they be used in adverts for the mothers who keep the baby closely?"
Another said: "The very uncomfortable ad.
Others stood next to the ad, a woman confessing that the song took her "experience".
"I think it's a great idea."
If I had milked the baby, I would have had one.
I think I'm just a cow when I pump.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it well.
It is an innovative product," one wrote.
Another commented: "It's a funny ads that he targets mothers (aboutly in their workplaces or toilets) who pump and consider themselves "gru".
The advert doesn't praise or criticize the deeries industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women are informing them that they all danced in their bra.
The ad is based on the idea that many women feel like beef while pumping a pump.
Although the LV pump is full of words, it does not have a single or tube and fit in the nursing Bree, which in the pumps gives women a walk, baby in the lap, and even the freedom to leave.
Anna Ballin, Mother's partner, and E. C. D. said: "Elvi pump is a revolutionary product that should begin in a bold and productive manner.
By drawing parallel portraits of women and milky cows, we wanted to paint on the pumping and all of its challenges at the Spotlight, a recreational and related way of expressing the incredible sense of release of the new pump.
LV pump didn't take place in the first news this time.
In the London Fashion Week, the mother of a two child used the product to give Catwa to designer Marta Jakuboski.
Hundreds of migrant children were taken to a tent camp in the Texas border
The number of detained immigrant children has increased, although the monthly border is relatively stable, because the establishment of the Trump administration makes it more difficult to keep the children in their sponsorship.
Traditionally, most sponsors are afraid to lose their own chances of being immigrants and children without documents.
The risk was raised in June when the Federal Authority announced that possible sponsorships and other adult members of their family would have to submit fingerprints, and information would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, a senior officer of immigration and co-foundment testified before Matthew Albania Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who appealed to sponsoring orphans children.
The agency later stated that there was no past crime history of the people of the Gitatta.
"Sponsor or sponsor's family members are approximately 80% of the illegal country, and one of them is a large part of the premisesi criminal".
So we continue to search them," said Nikester Alberta.
In an attempt to destabilize children in a more rapid society, officials introduced some new rules that had to be brought into court within a month of detention, which had previously been 60 days before, informing the shelters.
Many will appear through video conference calls without personally coming to their lawsuit for legal status to immigration judges.
Those who will be considered uninformed of relief will be quickly expelled.
According to the shelter staff and recent reports from the system, children will be in custody as long as the bashi day, with more anxiety or depression, so that there may be an attempt to be violent or run away.
Supporters said that these concerns are more intense in the major centres like Tornillo, where children are more likely to be more concerned, more likely to be ignored, due to their size.
They also said that it would be possible for many to move to the center without being mentally prepared or having enough time to leave their friends, the troms can be raised a few times so that they are already suffering.
The United States, French and Turkish called the "superior forces" to leave Syria immediately.
U.N. General Assembly called on Foreign Minister Walid-Al-Mwalem to return to Syria's refugee country, although there were eight years of fighting in the country.
Mowalem, also the deputy minister of the country, said that foreign forces are illegally on the ground in the country, and that "we will take appropriate action."
"You have to leave immediately without them," he told the council.
Mowalem emphasized that "the war against terrorism is nearly over," in Syria, where more than 3600,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have been forced to flee their homes.
He said the Lebanese would launch war until "the whole Syrian territories are cleared" against both terrorism and "illegal foreign presence".
In Syria, there are approximately 22,000 U.S. troops, both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against Presidenti Bashar-Al-Assad are mainly training and consultations.
There are over 1,000 troops in France in this war-torn country.
In the question of refugees, Mowalem said that the situation is appropriate for them to return and that he blames "some Western countries for spreading fear" that prompted refugees to stay away.
"We call on the international community and human organizations to help the return," he said.
"They're politics about the complete humanitarian problem".
The United States and the European Union have provided that Syria will not be granted any reconstruction assistance until the end of the war between Assad and the opposition.
United Nations diplomats said that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to build a buffer zone in the last big rebel base of Idlib has brought forward through political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkic agreement has prevented a major attack by the Russian-backed Syrian forces in the area, where there are three million people living.
However, Mowalem emphasized that the deal had "surreal time" and hoped that the military move would work against the jihadists, including the Battle of Al-Qaida-Ossa Front fighters, who would be "founded."
United Nations Ambassador Staff D. Mistuira soon set up the draft of the post-Next Constitution and the first meeting of a new committee formed by the government and members of the opposition in order to strengthen the course of the election.
Mowalem states in the committee that the Syrian government's participation in the committee should limit the work of the panel "to review articles of the current Constitution, and that he warned against the unintended intervention."
Why Trump would win the second round
In this argument, Trump will win 2020 re-election, as a large number of Liberals probably hope that the position of his president will be completed in unification due to impeachment and scandal.

Outside of the mid-election, the external money has reached the flood like water
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania had paid for the 17th vote, as two candidates are fighting for one seat by the Congressional District.
Recently, in the city of Pittsburgh, the Pittsburgh District, they fought Democrats Connor Lamb, who won another seat in a special election in the last spring.
Lamb fights against Republican Keith Rothfas, who currently represents the 12th District of Old Pennsylvania, much of which is part of the new 17th District.
In January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the old districts were constitutionally in favor of the Republicans, which caused the map to be replaced.
The new 17th District's election struggle led to the money-making competition between the Federal Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
In March, the Lamb was promoted to the Lamb by Lamb after he won in the widely broadcast election in the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
The seat had been in the possession of Republicans for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in this district.
Political scholars are slightly ahead of Democrats.
L. S. China for supporting the U.S.
diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, a step back from Washington.
Mr. Trump made a warm meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, and had a hotel in Panama on June 201, but later removed the group's directors of the Medieval Tramp Organization.
In a statement earlier this month, Foreign Department spokesman Heather Naart said in a statement that "the recent decision not to recognize the president was to be recognized by Duffer officials decided to return the U.S. Chiefs from the Dominican Republic, the Dominican Republic, and the United States from Panama to the United States.
However, the sentence was only pronounced against El Salvador, who received about $140 million in the drug cycle control, development and economic assistance sector in 278.
The proposed penalty, which included financial assistance, and specific visa restrictions, could have become sad for this country due to its high unemployment and murder rates.
In addition to the progress of the internal meeting, North America and Central American officials suspended a high-end conference on protection and economic prosperity in the United States as a step to prevent the crowd from gathering in the U.S. over the last year.
But in mid-September, the administration's top officials made it clear that they wanted to do the convention, which effectively ended the possibility of the execution of the L. Buffalo.
The diplomats said that Vice-President Mike Pance would address the convention, scheduled in mid-November, to give the administration a message of importation.
And the American Americans in three countries returned to San Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without having a new strong message or punishment from the direction of Washington.
Mr. Bolton, a spokesman for the White House, refused to comment on the statements made by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal affairs.
Their statement confirmed an external analyst close to the administration and also refused to reveal the name.

Federal coaches want death penalty for suspected of terrorist attacks in New York

In order to carry out the execution notice issued by the death penalty in New York South District, Kounsley had to prove that Chunsov was killing eight "outstandingly" and severely "incorporated."
According to the court document, both of these are sufficient to execute executions.

Hey, wait a minute.
We framed... no, we didn't," he said, fakes the Senator.
In July, the letter was sent to Ford Phastein, with the description of the charges against Kavanoff, and the letter became leaked in September—but Fawstein refused to leak the letter from his office.
"I'm Dr. Ford's accusations Lukeini, I didn't even leak anything," said the Phainstein Committee, The Hill Report.
"He asked me to keep it secret and I kept it secret according to his words."
But he didn't have the president's pilgrimage, he opened his mouth on Saturday night's rally: "I say what happened, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't, but I've never seen a worse body language."
Presidenti said that Democrats have been using the allegations of sexual abuse in the case of three women.

Air Neugini said in a Saturday afternoon report that a male passenger is not available.
The airline stated that they were working with local administration, hospitals and investigators to find out.
The airline immediately refused to inform the details of the passenger's age and nationality.
The aircraft helped the rescue of some local boat passengers and staff after the plane had been in the water as it was attempting to land at the Chuck Island Airport.
Officials reported Friday that seven were taken to the hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers were in hospital on Saturday, and that they were all stable.
There are still no clear details of what happened.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said that the aircraft went to the water before it reached the runway.
Some witnesses thought the aircraft had crossed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jens said the plane was off too low.
"What's a good thing," Jens said.
Jens said that he and others arrived at the front door of the locomotive aircraft through the hip.
He said the airliners were screaming and a little bit hurt in his head.

Analysts have been able to make time for the burning of the living woman.
In 2014, a woman who was accused of burning a woman in Mississippi put the prosecution on Saturday in the trial of the accused.
The U.S. judicial analyst Paul Raolet testified several hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
How he used cell records to describe the night of his death in front of the jury, the 26-year-old defendant Queenton Teles and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers.
Rawlett said he recovered several cell records from the fact that Teles and Chambers were together in the evening of the death, against the previous debut of Teles, the Clinion laser report.
Information suggests that he was with his cell Chambers at the time, although he was Dyby who was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in town that night.
When the coaches asked if Teles were telling the truth that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that "false, because his truck was on the day of his truck."
Another obituary is that Teles said he knew him from two weeks before Chambers' death.
From the cell records, they were known only for a week.
Raolet said that shortly after the Chamber's death, Teles removed Text from his own phone, Col and U.S. data.
"He's wiped out from his life," Halley said.
The end of the case has been placed on Sunday.
The judge said the case is expected to go to the jury the following day.

Another black man?
New York Nanny sues a couple of couples who have been fired after "racist" Text.
A man in New York is suing a nanny related couple for a confusing bisexual expulsion from a mother so as to call him "Arcine black".
The couple rejected the allegations of being racist and called for a lawsuit on "jumping".
The mother of two children, Lincy Plusco-faxman, expressed frustration after arriving in the first day of work in 2016, to learn that Gigel Morris, a new black man, is a black man.
"NAAAAAAA Another Black" Mrs. Plusco-Folxman writes in her husband's text.
However, he sent it to his husband instead of sending it to Miss Morris, twice.
Later on to understand his mistake, "Obitu" Plusco-faxman was expelled by Miss Morris, who said that their former nanny who was an African-American, expected a Filipino to work badly, the report of the New York Post.
Miss Morris was given a day's mines and then sent home to Ubar.
Morris is now suing the couple for compensation of compensation and is asking for a daily compensation of $350 for six months, although he was first hired to stay at home without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, don't do that," he told the post on Friday, adding more equilibrium, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple accused Morris of being racist, claiming that the expulsion of Morris was a reasonable task, fearing that he could not believe after he was charged with a charge.
"He didn't want to say what my wife sent.
He is not a racist.
We are not racist couples," husband Joel Plusko tells the post.
"But will you leave your children in someone with whom you treat bad, though it's wrong?"
Your newborn son?
Tell me."
Plusko said about the allegations of "jumping" that his wife only gave birth to a child two months ago and was in the "very difficult situation."
"Will you go against someone like that?"
It's not very good to do it," said the investment banker.
In the context of the ongoing legal case, the public court was strongly condemned against the behavior and logic of the couple on social media.
Belton reveals fear that readers may not be able to interact with the bear, published in the new letter
The daughter of Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to say what would happen to the mind of the first one to fall.
It's very interesting to know that after the great success of the paddington.
His father, who served as the BBC's cameraman before he received inspiration from children's books from Little Toy Bear, said that he was optimistic about his work being denied, adding that the 60th anniversary of his death was his "unfamilies".
Regarding Belton, whom he described as "a very important member of our family," said his father was very proud of his final success.
"He was a silent man, and not a arrogant person," he said.
"But he was so real as your own child had achieved some success: you're proud of him, though you don't have any geomica in it.
I think he saw the success of the Belton.
Although it was the harvest of his own creation and imagination, he was always credited by the 6th-century.
My daughter was on the way to the dead and I had to say goodbye to the phone.
After the landing, his daughter was rushed to the Nais Hospital, Louis Pashtur 2A, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Don't call regularly to say it's too bad, and that he won't live," Mrs. ibn-Liprooz said.
"After that I got Nod's phone and found out he'd die in two minutes and I was forced to say goodbye to him on the phone.
And that's what I do.
I say, "Tashi, Darling I love you very much.
I'll come to you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medicines that doctors gave to keep her heart going slowly stopped working on her body and running out of the body.
He died a while ago and then everything was closed.
I had no choice but to wait, know everything.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was the family and people.
I had to hold myself."
At last Mrs. Edenan-Laprej, then mourned his daughter's death, riding the plane along with other passengers - he was otherwise for this difficult situation.
Nobody knows," he said.
‘I lay down my head, I was falling constantly from my eyes.
It's impossible to describe it, but I sat on the plane and became the undisclosed pain of Nod.
That he needs my love and sympathy.
I know how good he was at the base.
She posted cards to stop suicide on this female bridge
Two women, who lost their loved ones in suicides, worked to stop other people's suicides.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamfrey posted cards with an inspiring message at Welsh Bridge where people can call for co-existment.
Ms. Davis's son, Tyler, suffered from depression from age 13 and committed suicide at age 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel that I'm doing it over," he said.
Ms. Davis, aged 43, who lives in Leedney, said his son was a promising Shelf and had a confiscative smile.
"All knew him for his laughter".
Everyone said the house was bright in her smile."
However, before he died, he quits work because he "was really in the dark."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, aged 11, found him dead.
Ms. Davis said: "I continue to worry that this attempt will break."
Ms Davis made cards, "Let everyone know that there are people you can talk to, he can be a friend."
Don't sit quietly - need to talk.
Ms. Hamfries, the girlfriend of Ms. Davis for many years, lost his 15-year-old partner Mark, after his mother's death.
"He never said he was upset or something," he said.
"I noticed some changes in his behavior two days ago in Crismas".
"Crismas's day was very bad - when the kids were giving their gift she didn't go to them."
He said that his death had a huge psychological injury to them, but had to overcome it: "It made a great void in the family.
We were cut off.
But we have to fight him in the path."

Brett Cavanoff's future question in the beginning of the FB's investigations
"I thought that if we could give anything that he wanted - because of the limited time of the investigation, the opportunity is limited - we could probably bring a bit of unity," Mr. Flec said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee might be "to read" the bias.
What was the reason Mr. Kavanoff and his Republican supporters didn't want FB I investigation?
Their obligations are related to time.
In the mid-elections, only five weeks left – if the Republicans, according to the expectations, will get the worst results, their efforts will be very weak to get the favorites in the country's highest court.
George W. Bush is calling senators and is making a public appearance to the White House to support Mr. Kavanoff, through which Mr. Bush meets his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary of Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI report is presented?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently present.
Mr. Kavanoff would not be able to receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would make him sure that the vice-President Mike Pence tie would be broken by him in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's defection number is "combined" under Kim.
After seven years in power Kim Jong-un, North Korea's defection, a South Korean lawmaker made this statement.
Park Bieong-Seg, quoted as the information of South Korea's merger ministry, stated that the number of defectors last year was 1,127 - which was 2,706.
Mr. Park said that the main reason for the heavy border control and human trafficking is the bachelor's money debut between North Korea and China.
Pyongong did not make any public comment on the matter.
A large number of defectors from North Korea have been killed by South Korean citizenship.
Soul reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans had passed the illegal border since the Korean War ended in 1933.
Most of China escapes from China, with the longest border with North Korea, and it is much easier than crossing a highly protected zone (DM Z) between two Koreans.
China is not as refugees, but as illegal immigrants, and often forced to return to their countries.
Relations between North and South Korea - who are still in the war - have significantly improved in recent months.
At the beginning of the current month, leaders of both countries held a meeting for negotiations at Pyongyangi, which was in the center of the thirteenth nuclear disarmament talks.
It came after a historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they were fairly agreed to create the nuclear weapons free Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young-ho blamed the U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress.
In a speech given to the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Mr. R. said, "There will be no confidence in our national protection in the United States, and we will not be first in such situations in a state of total disbanding ourselves."
Nancy Pietsie told Bret Kavanoff "Hitria-During" that she was incapable of serving in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader of House, Nancy Pillasey, called the Supreme Court Nomine Bret Kavantof "hitia-instructure" and said that he was inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pillarsy commented in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin on Saturday, Texas.
Pillars said his reaction to the Kavanif's testimony in front of the Senate Judicari Committee on Thursday, "I couldn't have thought that any woman would ever have done such a thing would have been called a "hitia-fed".
Kavanoff strongly denied the allegations, stating that he had made Dr. Christine Blaze sex when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanf was passionate, talking about his own family and high school life and breathing.
He explicitly condemned Democrats in the committee and accused him of being a "driven and obsessive character" in the case of the Libertals, accusing him of being a "driven and obsessive character" in the 2016 presidential election of Hillary Clinton.
Pillac said he believed the testimony of Kavanoff proved that he was not worthy of the Supreme Court, because it proved he was biased against Democrats.
"I think, the statement that he made, and the way Clinton and Democrats had been destabilised, he himself proved uninspired," he said.
When asked if he had received a majority in the Kavanf if he had been asked if he would impeach him in the Democratic House, Pessey was unintended.
"I'm going to say that if he doesn't speak the truth to Congress or FBI, then he's not the only one who deserves the Supreme Court, but also the one who's in court," Pecsi said.
Kavanoff is currently the judge of the Department of Corttors in the D.C.
Pillarsy added that as a Democrat, he was worried that Kavanoff would oppose the Fordicative Care Act or Ro. Od, because he himself was an acoustic justice.
In his confirmation hearing, Kavanoff avoided the question of whether he would change some of the Supreme Court decisions.
"It can't be let it happen that Historicia-infected, biased people go to court and tell us "It's not great," Pessey said.
And women should control it.
It is a fair debate, months and years of anger are coming out, and she cannot cry.
"We get angry," Ms. Steem told me after 455 years.
"I don't think it's rare, what do you say?"
He also said, "A woman's executive has done much to help me, who would say she was crying when she was angry, but she chose the approach that when she began to cry, she would talk to him, "You might think I'm sorry, because I'm crying.
I'm really angry."
Then he would continue.
I thought it was amazing."
Tears usually act as a manifestation of rage, because they are mainly the victims of misunderstanding.
One of the early jobs is my sharpest memory, in a male-run office, where I once saw myself in an incredible rage, an old woman holding my skater - that I was always afraid of him who pulled me down the stairs.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're angry".
They think you're sorry and they'll be glad to see."
Patrick Schourder, a former Democrat Congressman in Colorado, worked with him during the presidential election of Gary Hart.
In 1968, when Mr. Hart was caught at the Mackey Business boat abroad about marriage, and left for dirty acts, deeply disappointed Ms. Schörder thought there was no reason for his own presidential candidacy.
"It wasn't a very well-being decision," he said to laugh 30 years later.
"There are seven other candidates in the fight, and none of them wanted.
One called it "Sno White and Seven dwarfs".
As he was delayed at the beginning of the campaign, he was behind the fund collection, and so he made Aung Sangnier that he wouldn't get off the run without collecting $2 million.
It was the Battle of the Harp.
He saw that a supporter had just been given a man's $10,000.
"Do they think I'll get a price?" he wonders.
When he announced that he did not receive formal broadcasts, he was deeply grateful for the passion and his supporters' support, making it difficult to collect money from the system, which caused him to target the voters, and to become ill with anger about gender discrimination.
"You could have felt that my nerves had happened," said Ms. Schrder, in the news media's recall of the effects of my nervousness.
"You could have thought that Clenex was my corporate sponsor".
I remember, I thought, where would they bury me?
"He cried?"
The United States-China trade war on how to side with Beijing
The first episode of the United States-China trade war was exciting, and when the war ended in the final episode, Beijing could benefit in the long term of the conflict in the two countries, like experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump, in early this year, raised the tax of major Chinese Raftani products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most notable answer was this week, when the total imports from China were about half of the total, with an estimated $200 billion ($150 billion), a new one.
Beijing took revenge each time – most recently, they raised five to ten per cent of the US$60 billion.
With the eyes of China decided to fight with the eyes and the world's second largest economy, there is no chance that it is soon to drop the eyes.
It would be an insult to the President of China to open his head to the United States, but it would be offensive to the President of China, Shi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing can properly play cards, the pressure of the U.S. trade war can help China in a positive way in two economys.
"The situation can be more dangerous in both countries as a result of any rapid political decision by Washington or Beijing, more dangerous than the idea of a well-known economic collapse," Thunk Tank Institute, Associated researcher Abigail Grace of the Center for New American Security, said.
Syria called for its return to refugees, said the Foreign Minister.
Syria has said that the country is ready for the voluntary return of the refugees, and has appealed to the renovation of the Seven-year war-torn country.
While speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mwalem said the situation is improving in the country.
"The progress in the fight against terrorism is because of the stability and protection of the situation today," he said.
The government continued rehabilitation to restore normal conditions in areas destroyed by terrorists.
All conditions are favorable now to the people who are forced to leave the country because of their daily life and livelihood due to the economic situation.
The UN estimates that more than 55 million Syrians fled the country since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
The remaining 6 million people in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mwalem said that the Syrian government welcomed all the aids in the reconstruction of the country.
However, he also insisted that there would not be a need for any conditions to be taken in support of or to provide assistance to the country of the rebels.

He held the duty of John Ram in his home country, who lost the U.S. Lizard Schwarfer Tiger Woods on Sunday and 1A on Sunday.
