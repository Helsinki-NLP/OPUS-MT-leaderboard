I'll work.
What's your name?
I agree with you.
You're rich.
Will you go to America next month?
I don't want to swim.
I don't own.
Thank you very much.
He hasn't come yet.
I'm sorry!
I've got a lot to say to you.
Ice reflects the obsessive ray.
Come out.
They screamed.
I ran home.
We made pancakes for Prashaw.
You don't have a bike?
I don't know if he's coming.
You're screaming.
He's a kashlen.
He doesn't want to talk about it.
Everyone saw that.
I give my cat food every morning and evening.
My son came to my house.
I'm a student.
I'll attend.
Do you have your passport?
Please correct my accent.
Do as he says.
You look so tired.
Tom started screaming.
Sit there.
I wasn't alone.
I learned a lot from you.
It's wrong.
Tom always keeps his word.
Is Tom here?
I'm a doctor.
We've seen them.
Today is June 18 and today is Muiel's birthday.
Who won?
Come on, let's get ready.
We just have to tell Tom to do this for us, don't we?
Can we get these cups in a position to do so?
I'm going to Osaka station.
I don't think Tom is responsible for it.
Somebody's a Cashlow.
I went to Baker.
I learned to live without him.
My father is very good.
I want you to stay with Tom.
Hurry up.
Tom was very busy with work.
I'm not proud of the way I used it.
I screamed.
We'll work.
He came.
I don't agree with him.
Come to me.
I'm screaming.
My hand-cuffs aren't working properly.
Forget Tom.
How dare you!
Is this Tom's book?
He was angry.
Who are you?
I could have died.
Are you sure?
It's time to go.
She neglects studying.
I don't want Tom to see me.
They eat healthy food.
My mother loves music.
He easily makes his head hot.
Wherever he goes, his dog would go behind him.
Who's this?
Can I work here?
There's still a problem.
The old bottle deposits is my drug.
I like maths.
I don't want to go.
When does the next bus leave?
What does that mean?
Do you have a bike?
Do you want to come?
My mother can play very well golf.
He knows where we live.
I know your name.
Tom's not here now.
What did you say?
He worked as our guide.
Tom stopped screaming.
How old is Tom?
Come quickly!
Stop screaming.
Was Tom there?
I shed blood today afternoon.
My back still hurts.
Where did Tom go?
They look like an American.
You were Tom's only friend.
I went to the hospital.
I accepted his invitation.
My father can drive very well.
I'll be alone.
You need a friend.
Forget about Tom.
I think Tom said that his surname Jackson.
You know Tom for a long time.
I know.
I'm playing football now.
My stuff hasn't arrived yet.
Tom hasn't been here yet.
Please wait until he arrives.
Tom rarely keeps his word.
You eat something.
Is there anyone at home?
What do you do?
I think Tom is fine.
Where do I get the stamp?
I'm gonna cry.
Can he speak French?
Tom could not take that.
We love our country.
Is he a doctor?
A little more nib?
And one day he left.
They wanted to steal the car.
I'm still your friend.
Stop that woman.
How old is that church?
Ask me tomorrow.
That's still mine.
Where do I claim my stuff?
We do what we want.
Tom's right.
I ran to my mother.
This book is for students whose mother tongue is not Japanese.
Tom wanted to be Minister.
Who would you trust?
He is a doctor.
You can talk.
That's what I deserved.
No one is essential.
Are you here?
The rest of them laughed.
How much nights do you have?
Have you seen the man in this picture?
I lost my stuff.
I think it's impossible for Tom.
I don't want Tom to wake up.
My son is reading economy.
The sky looks like it's going to start falling on the ice tonight.
How much is it worth?
You know what Tom wants.
We'll dance.
I can't stop the Cash.
I just want Tom to be happy.
Those who live in the glass room should not throw stones.
Why are you screaming?
Stop Tom.
I'm in pain with my fists, I think I should go to the hospital.
Tom wants his umbrella back.
Is Tom at home?
Tom always keeps his word.
I eat nausea.
I'm your friend.
How long have you been?
Who's here?
The town splits a river east and west.
Come and see it yourself.
Do you understand what he's saying?
I have to go to sleep.
You got a car?
Tomo plays the fellow.
Do you have any idea to do something now?
He's having lunch now.
Can you keep an eye on Tom?
You should ask him for advice.
This teeth are hurting.
How much do these potatoes?
How much for extra good?
Everybody liked Tom.
What happened here?
Here's your key.
Are you Japanese?
Hurry up.
Eat whatever you like.
Take this.
You've ever broken a bone?
He was angry.
We learned English.
I couldn't move my right leg.
I've had a dry cough.
How old is your grandfather?
Can I ask you a question?
What is that?
Here's your key.
We've seen worse things.
Help Tom.
I'm pretty sure.
What is that?
He's eating.
The rabbits like carrots.
You didn't understand.
My mother hurts.
Sit down on the table.
He's younger than me.
What's your name?
We were waiting for you.
Tom was inside.
Can I use the credit card?
It's a big night, isn't it?
The book is available only in French.
Tell me.
I'll take her.
Can I pay the credit card?
Tom found my bike.
I went to Jackson's house.
He wore a black hat.
Anything else?
Everyone's screaming.
Is there any concessions for the students?
I eat noodles.
Tom is inside the house.
Don't ask what they think, ask what they do.
Will you come in?
I'll tell you.
We like football.
What do you want?
Good evening.
He eats empty fruit.
I'd like to have a new squash for these shoes.
Everybody liked Tom.
Who is that?
I'm still your friend.
Have fun.
Please listen!
He runs.
I'll swim if it rains tomorrow.
My right shoulder hurts.
My father was busy.
All are ready to go.
I couldn't catch the train at 7:00.
He had two daughters.
This is my wife.
Let's tell the story.
Do you have a pen?
Class doesn't begin before 8:30.
How many lunch times do you eat?
What does that word mean?
How much do I get?
You speak English?
What they did is wrong.
My son is taller than me.
Tom's parents were also singers.
Here's your bell.
Tom's alive.
Looking in faucus.
Answer me.
This bag is mine.
Tom is angry.
How much is it worth?
You can eat as much as you like.
Yes.
I've had a little fever.
Can you speak French?
He is a doctor.
Fill it.
How old are you?
Hold Tom.
They screamed.
You're screaming.
I don't think it'll rain tomorrow.
I'll be back when I'm done.
I like the light.
He grew up in France.
He didn't work Sunday night.
He taught me to write.
Happy birthday!
It's not your book, it's mine.
Toroon people have been killed.
He eats nothing but fruit.
Tom's father is a defender.
Listen.
Do you think Tom wants to eat now?
It's a time.
I never make mistakes.
Where's the door to UA 111?
I pick up.
Why are you shouting?
Tom wants his umbrella back.
You usually go to bed at the time?
The two countries had an agreement between themselves.
I speak the empty French with Tom.
Tom hits his eyes.
Can you get it a little gift?
Tom is now in Garde.
What did you forget?
I really don't want to go.
You go first.
That's my sister.
I forgot.
He's a duck.
He hasn't come yet.
It's not mine.
Who came?
He's eating fruit.
I don't speak Japanese.
I'll be grateful.
The horrorists let the prisoners go.
I could have gone with you, but I didn't have time.
I lost my wallet.
He's a good man.
We did that.
The government has reduced taxpayers.
Let go of town!
Gun it from Tirish.
He's eating.
How old is the church?
Let's go!
This can be said in Japanese.
Did you see the way out?
How many airports are you going to leave for Syltel Bus?
Don't argue.
That's my cat.
That bag is mine.
I have an old computer that I don't need anymore.
I've got it.
We were walking on foot.
I want it.
I need those papers.
Tom screams.
Tom laughs very little.
Eat what you want.
Tom cries.
How much is it worth?
I'm fine.
They're doctors.
The aircraft was on board at the time.
I don't know what you mean.
Most of the audience were businessmen.
Turn right.
Tom's probably asleep.
I'm hungry.
Tom won many races.
He knows where we live.
I learned a lot from Tom.
Tom potatoes are dust.
Everyone was screaming.
I'll be outside.
My mother can cook well.
They're screaming.
The study was successful.
I think that the gold that Tom has received is little to be allowed to keep it to him.
Boston is a big town.
I'm 17 too.
Here's your key.
Leave it to Tom.
Eat your milk.
Both of us are Tom.
They were all happy.
Is this your book?
I don't want to go with Tom.
Who broke the flower?
Tom is injured.
Go behind Tom.
Is Tom still mad at me?
Tom has been hit.
We were waiting for you.
I'm not perfect.
Do you know what he said?
Listen to me.
We've made a lot of mistakes.
Why are you shouting?
What's your father's name?
Look over there.
Tell me if there's anything I can do.
We tried.
Tom resigned in October.
The market is next to the doctorhouse.
Happy Canada Day!
I'll be late.
What does this sign mean?
Tom's got his head off.
Are we ready?
I like Tom's blueapple.
He was very patient.
How old are you?
Listen to me.
Will you go shopping with me?
Slow down.
They're there.
I'll scream.
Everybody's exhausted.
Don't let me.
Who was that?
I'm shy.
When I said that Mary had left the city, it seemed really surprised to see Tom.
I heard screams.
What time is your plane?
I don't want to talk about it.
My book seemed interesting.
Tell me what happened.
I'm up to 8 today.
Please burn the light.
Tom is injured.
I'm still your friend.
A few pages took me over two hours to translate English.
Are those yours?
Who is this?
Is this the smallest route to the station?
Tom tried to kill Mary.
Do you know what you're talking about?
It's impossible!
When does the train reach Yokohama?
What time is it?
The sentences that don't correct the right ones can submit more natural translations instead.
Your shoes are here.
Are all ready for tomorrow?
Did anyone leave a report for me?
I want to cook for you.
Excuse me, does this train go to Washington Square?
We're a failure.
The room is in AC.
Are you wearing all this?
Tom Boston was gone.
Tell me clearly.
Don't open that.
Tom saw him.
The evening can wear ice.
I'm not proud of that.
Is there anyone there?
It's wrong.
I'm not young anymore.
He's eating.
That's just blood.
Will you go fishing with us?
Just wait here.
I'll be back in twenty minutes.
Wait a minute.
Tom was injured.
Mary explained.
I'm not denying it.
Don't look!
End it as soon as possible.
Use it.
When does the train reach Yokohama?
I don't understand that either.
This morning I got seven.
I'm at home.
Take it easy.
Merry Christmas!
I'm going in.
Me too.
I'm not too busy.
That's great.
Do it again!
Tom started in Kash.
They're kids.
I don't want to argue with you.
"Why don't you go?" "Caron I don't wanna go."
I know that.
I'll be around.
Call me tomorrow.
Tell me what you want.
My leg hurts.
Ask Tom.
I wonder what to give you on your birthday.
Don't forget the ticket.
Good to see you again.
Why are you shouting?
Stay right there.
Eat the food you like.
We used to play at the park.
I'm busy.
Where can I buy a ticket?
I've done my job.
I'm planning to stay at the hotel.
I've finally got my keys.
Tom starts screaming.
I'm not arguing.
Can you read?
How old is your father?
Are you okay?
I've never seen Tom as happy with it.
Don't come in.
We're lost.
Tom screams.
We can still do that.
I tried.
I'm sick.
I'm just looking. Thank you.
Unfortunately it's true.
We were waiting for them.
How old do I look?
Tom isn't happy here.
He was angry.
I don't like coffee.
Keep your voice down.
Can I get your phone number?
Why do you want to meet Tom?
Here you are.
We don't care what he does.
I called my good friend Tom.
We will never play better than this.
We're shy.
The bill will be cleared today.
Tomorrow I'm going to Paris.
You'll never be alone.
You can go there.
We both know that this is not right.
Eat what you like.
I have wine.
Why was Tom crying?
