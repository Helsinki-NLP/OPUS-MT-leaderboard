Tom won't win.
Tom thinks you're stupid.
Stop shouting.
He doesn't do anything.
Do you have a bigger bowl?
I thought this book was interesting.
I don't know the answer.
I love the tour.
I don't want to go with you.
I'll be back in three weeks.
He eats nothing but fruit.
What do you mean, "ita"?
Is Tom fine?
I think I lost my key.
Who sent you?
Stop that woman.
Did you wear all this?
Pakistan is a Muslim country.
Do you understand French?
I'll be back late.
Tom says he'll resign.
Get it!
Tom's been hit.
Children love to do these things.
I feel so sorry for him.
Have you ever done that?
What's the point of doing this?
What's the date today?
Goodbye.
He's angry.
I absolutely agree.
I like my dad's pizza.
Do you understand what he's saying?
I wrote a letter.
I like apples.
Didn't you buy it today?
Eat that ass!
It's not true what you said.
They have two daughters.
Any sacrifices for children?
Come here!
Everyone ignored Tom.
I live in a small village.
Keep an eye on Tom.
What's the price?
Look!
We agree.
Tom's out.
Greetings, how are you?
That Tom's a really good fellow.
I don't want you.
Do you have my book?
I'll be back later.
He punished Tom Mary.
Don't open it.
Come in.
Tom's teaching me French.
Mind if I sit next to you?
So it's hard.
My neighbor's name is Tom Jackson.
I don't know exactly what to say.
Yesterday was my 17th birthday.
Where else would Tom go?
I need a locker.
You must eat this coughp.
Who can take a day off?
I want to change my ticket.
Tom's clearly not happy.
Eat whatever you like.
They all shouted.
It's late.
Let us down.
I don't get tired.
I had a cat.
Wait.
How many times did it open?
It's ours.
Why don't you try to take your money back?
Can I see your passport?
I can't find any words.
How can you be so calm?
Eat what you want.
In Rome.
Tom's tired.
I can take care of it.
When will you come back?
Can you speak French?
I wouldn't allow it to unite you.
In such a way, Mount Everest is the roof of the Earth.
I was sitting.
Come back.
Tom tried to raise his face.
Tom is dead.
Tom was crying like a child.
Leave him alone.
I don't recognize anyone from a twin anymore.
I'm reading your book.
Nothing's gonna happen.
He was talking.
Can I eat?
It's taller than Tom Mary.
The kid's screaming.
I sleep all my time.
Ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, 80, 80, 100, 100.
He spends his evening reading books.
I win.
Take the Fleece.
I'm not gonna make it.
Good night!
They're all screaming.
There are many branches of science.
No, not me, you!
Watching bikes and pedestrians!
You always complain.
For what?
I want to open an account.
You're gonna have to buy a ticket when you're on a bus.
French isn't hard to learn.
I'm getting cold.
I bought a pound of meat the other day.
Watch your tongue!
Is everything okay?
Lincoln died at 1865.
We're failed.

Allow me to go.
I accepted his invitation.
They have two twins.
You got a car?
You're very brave.
Don't let me down.
Do you have a bike?
Now the most important thing you can do is stay calm.
Where's the shop to buy undressable things?
Look at Tom.
How long will you stay?
I walk to school.
My throat's a little dry.
I have a new red car.
You call me.
Keep an eye on Tom.
"Why don't you go?" "Kaan I don't want to go."
You're not the first man to tell me that.
He's eating.
Tom swims well.
Doesn't it work?
He doesn't want to talk about it.
I've learned a lot from you.
Give me a deck.
Do you have a car?
Do you eat meat?
Is there any way to go there?
No one here does that.
You're not paying attention.
Can you show Tom around?
Take it.
Please confess my sincere apology.
Do you have anything to report?
I don't understand you.
He eats nothing but fruit.
I accepted his invitation.
Is Tom fine?

He'll be a ten-year-old in April.
Tom kept screaming.
He knows where we live.
What are you doing?
He's a doctor.
Eat as much as you like.
I worked for three years as a waiter.
Tom was there.
You must run.
Kiss Tom.
We can't sleep to sound.
He could speak French.
I got your letter.
I agree.
I see.
Tom isn't happy about it.
I like him.
You're rich.
I don't want to go to sleep.
My mother loves music.
Is this the way to the station?
Do you have a bike?
You always complain.
Do you eat meat?
My pots hurt.
Can you keep an eye on Tom?
Can you play the piano?
Look at Tom.
Today I got a call from Tom.
I'm drunk listening to music.
I want to buy them.
What's your name?
Don't yell!
The river fell to the Pacific Ocean.
Why are you shouting?
I love to sing in French.
Tom needs a friend.
Good to see you again.
How do you expect me to do this?
I saw him running.
I don't want to eat now.
Praise yourself.
I know Tom was your friend.
Stop practicing.
What'd you see in the back?
How do I get to the airport?
I need a pent!
Tom's screaming.
Tom, I'm a little busy here.
He's having lunch now.
I was easily found his house.
I promise you.
That's mine.
We'll win.
Eat whatever you want.
I can't find my stuff.

How deep?
I ran out.
I don't care what he does.

I didn't forget.
We write our own songs.
Are you okay?
I'll do my best not to disturb your studies.
Trust me.
I'm sorry I'm late.
He can say whatever he wants.
Were you there?
I know your name.
Is the ticket coming up for the concert?

Tom's gonna scream.
Tom wanted to talk to you.
I'll take you back in 20 minutes.
What do you want to grow up?
I accepted his invitation.
What does that mean?
I saw Tom last night.
You didn't understand.
They all screamed.
Would you please be able to speak more slowly?
What's the tooth?
The woman eats a shelf.
Tom wanted you to get this.
I'm done.
My father can fly the plane.
Who doesn't want to win?
He eats of it.
Attack!
Tom screamed.
Tom said she was allowed to leave immediately.

Don't stop here.
Forgive me, but it's not possible.
I want your opinion.
It's important to remember who your friend is.
This object is easily expanded.
Can you please tell me what you're saying?
I fully agree.
You go first.
Take us to the hospital.
I'm not your friend.
He ran.
I lost your phone number.
Get out of here!
Are you gonna go fishing with us?
How old was he?
Tom's got me French.
It looks cheap.
More water.
I love to travel.
I shouldn't have logged out.
Why?
Tom is breathing hard.
I know we still love each other.
Forgive me. I waited for you.
What have you found?
Sit here.
The hospital is crowded.
He asks how it can be done.
I asked them to send another ticket.
I can't believe it!
Tom will talk.
He explained the meaning of the phrase literally.
Here you go.
Read this.
How old is your father?
I saw that my mother was busy doing some clothes.
How much did you eat?
I'm not your friend.
I'm not screaming.
What does that word mean?
Wait outside.
Can you take me to the Grand Hotel?
I can't deny it.
The puzzle is funny.
They need friends.
Why don't you try to take your money back?
Tom feared Mary.
If he were to follow his doctor's advice, he might still be alive.
What is the purpose of your visit?
Tom can read French.
Ask Tom.
Don't yell!

Where can I buy books?
Do you know what he said?
What a shame.
I'm playing right now.
Call the hospital.

Come with me.
Get off.

Where is the hospital in the vicinity?
Where's the touch?
It was a devil rabbit.
I like black.
I'm depending on you.
Do you have any cokes?
I'm just kidding.

I saw him wash the car.
Tom Sighance got away.
This is smaller than me.
How long have you been in Boston?
How am I going to the station?

There's a cat in the kitchen!
I'm a student.
My father is open.
I think you both know Tom.

Thank you very much.
He hasn't come yet.
I'm sorry!
I have so much to tell you.
Ice reflects the rays.
Come out.
They screamed.
I ran home.
We made pancakes for dawn.
You don't have a bike?
I don't know if he's coming.
You're screaming.
She's Kassher.
He doesn't want to talk about it.
Everyone saw it.
I give my cat food every morning and evening.
My son came to my house.
I'm a student.
I'll attend.
Do you have your passport?
Please correct my accent.
Do as he says.
You look tired.
Tom started screaming.
Sit there.
I wasn't alone.
I learned a lot from you.
It's wrong.
Tom keeps his word.
Is Tom here?
I'm a doctor.
We've seen them.
It's June 18 and it's Muiel's birthday.
Who won?
Let's get ready.
We just have to tell Tom to do this for us, don't we?
Can we get these cups in the lirit?
I'm going to Osaka station.
I don't think Tom is responsible for it.
Somebody's a Cashlo.
I went to the job.
I learned to live without him.
My father is very good.
I want you to stay with Tom.
Hurry up.
Tom was very busy with his work.
I am not proud of the way I used it.
I screamed.
We'll work.
He came.
I don't agree with him.
Come at me.
I'm screaming.
My hand-cuffs aren't working properly.
Forget Tom.
How dare you!
Is this Tom's book?
He was angry.
Who are you?
I could have died.
Are you sure?
It's time to go.
She neglects studying.
I didn't want Tom to see me.
They eat healthy food.
My mother loves music.
He's easy enough to get his head off.
Wherever he goes, his dog would go behind him.
Who is this?
Can I work here?
There's still a problem.
The old bottle deposit is my drug.
I like maths.
I don't want to go.
When does the next bus leave?
What does that mean?
You don't have a bike?
Do you want to come?
My mother can play very well golf.
He knows where we live.
I know your name.
Tom's not here anymore.
What did you say?
He worked as our guide.
Tom stopped screaming.
How old is Tom?
Come soon!
Stop screaming.
Was Tom there?
I shed blood this afternoon.
My back still hurts.
Where did Tom go?
They look American.
You were Tom's only friend.
I went to the hospital.
I accepted his invitation.
My father can drive very well.
I'll be alone.
I need your friend.
Forget about Tom.
I think Tom said his first name is Jackson.
You know Tom for a long time.
I know.
I'm playing soccer now.
My stuff hasn't arrived yet.
Tom hasn't arrived here yet.
Please wait until he arrives.
Tom rarely keeps his word.
You eat something.
Is there anyone at home?
What are you doing?
I think Tom is fine.
Where do I get the stamp?
I'm gonna scream.
Can he speak French?
Tom might not have done that.
We love our country.
Is he a doctor?
Would you like to take a little more?
And one day he left.
They wanted to steal the car.
I'm still your friend.
Stop that woman.
How old is that church?
Ask me tomorrow.
That's still mine.
Where do I claim my stuff?
We do what we want.
Tom's right.
I ran to my mother.
The book is for students whose mother tongue is not Japanese.
Tom wanted to be the minister.
Who would you trust?
He's a doctor.
You can talk.
That's what I deserve.
Nobody is essential.
Do you live here?
The others were laughing.
How much nights do you have?
Have you seen the man in this photo?
I lost my luggage.
I think it's impossible for Tom.
I don't want to wake Tom up.
My son is reading economy.
The sky looks like it's snowing tonight.
How much is this gonna cost?
You know what Tom wants.
We dance.
I can't stop it.
I just want Tom to be happy.
Those living in glass should not be stoned.
Why are you screaming?
Stop Tom.
I'm losing my hands, I think I should go to the hospital.
Tom wants his umbrella back.
Is Tom home?
Tom always keeps his word.
I eat shit.
I'm your friend.
How long have you been?
Who's here?
The city is divided by a river east and west.
Come and see it yourself.
Do you understand what he's saying?
I have to go to sleep.
Do you have a car?
Tom too plays his mate.
Do you have any idea what to do?
He's having lunch now.
Can you keep an eye on Tom?
You should ask him for advice.
This tooth hurts.
How much are these potatoes?
How much for the extra property?
Everybody liked Tom.
What happened here?
Here's your key.
Are you Japanese?
Hurry up.
Eat whatever you like.
Take this.
You ever broken bones?
He was angry.
We learned English.
I couldn't move my right leg.
I've had a dry Cough.
How old is your grandfather?
Can I ask you a question?
What is it?
Here's your key.
We've seen worse things.
Help Tom.
I'm pretty sure.
What's that?
He's eating.
The rabbit carrots like.
You didn't understand.
My mother hurts.
Sit at the table.
He's younger than me.
What's your name?
We've been waiting for you.
Tom was inside.
Can I use the credit card?
It's a big night, isn't it?
This book is available only in French.
Tell me.
I'll take him away.
Can I pay the credit card?
Tom found my bike.
I went to Jackson's house.
He wore a black hat.
Anything else?
Everybody yell.
WHAT IS THE CHALLENGE?
I eat noodles.
Tom's inside the house.
Don't ask how they think they do.
Will you come in?
I'll tell you.
We like soccer.
What do you want?
Good evening.
He eats empty fruit.
I want a new scissors for these shoes.
Everybody liked Tom.
Who's that?
I'm still your friend.
Have fun.
Please listen!
He runs.
I'll swim if it rains tomorrow.
My right shoulder hurts.
My father was busy.
Everyone is ready to go.
I couldn't catch the train at 7:00.
She had two daughters.
This is my wife.
Let's tell the story.
Do you have a pen?
Class doesn't start before 8:30.
What time do you have for lunch?
What does that word mean?
How much do I get?
You speak English?
What they did is wrong.
My son is taller than me.
Tom's parents were a singer.
Here you go.
Tom's alive.
He's in Farcas.
Answer me.
This bag is mine.
Tom was angry.
How much is it worth?
The more you eat, the more you wish.
Let go.
I've had a little fever.
Can you speak French?
He's a doctor.
Fill me.
How old are you?
Grab Tom.
They screamed.
You're screaming.
I don't think it'll rain tomorrow.
I'll be back when it's over.
I like astrologers.
She grew up in France.
He didn't work Sunday night.
He taught me to write.
Happy birthday!
It's not your book, it's mine.
Toroj people were killed.
He eats nothing but fruit.
Tom's father is a protector.
Listen.
Do you think Tom wants to eat now?
It's time.
I never make mistakes.
Where's the door to UA 111?
I took it.
Why are you shouting?
Tom wants his umbrella back.
What time do you usually go to bed?
The two countries have made a deal between themselves.
I speak empty French with Tom.
Tom hit his eyes.
Could you just tap it for a gift?
Tom's in Garde.
What did you forget?
I really don't want to go.
You go first.
That's my sister.
I forgot.
He smiled.
He hasn't come yet.
It's not mine.
Who came?
He's eating fruit.
I don't speak Japanese.
I'll be grateful.
The terrorists let the prisoners go.
I could have gone with you, but I didn't have time.
I lost my wallet.
He's a good man.
We did that.
The government has reduced tax money.
Let go of town!
Count it to Tisher.
He's eating.
How old is that church?
Let's go!
This is Japanese.
Did you see him leaving?
How many airports are you going to leave for Seattle?
Don't fight.
That's my cat.
That bag is mine.
I have an old computer that I don't need anymore.
I've got it.
We were on foot.
I want it.
I need those papers.
Tom screamed.
Tom laughs very little.
Eat what you want.
Tom crying.
How much is it worth?
I'm fine.
They're doctors.
The plane was on its way around nine o'clock.
I don't know what you mean.
Most of the audience were businessists.
Turn right.
Tom's probably asleep.
I'm hungry.
Tom won a lot of running.
He knows where we live.
I learned a lot from Tom.
Tom potatoes are dust.
Everyone was screaming.
I'll be outside.
My mother can cook better.
They screamed.
The research was successful.
I think that the gold that Tom has received will have little chance to keep it.
Boston is a big city.
I'm 17.
Here's your key.
Leave it to Tom.
Eat your milk.
Both of us are Tom.
They were all happy.
Is this your book?
I don't want to go with Tom.
Who broke the flower?
Tom's hurt.
Follow Tom.
Is Tom still mad at me?
Tom's been hit.
We've been waiting for you.
I'm not perfect.
Do you know what he said?
Listen to me.
We've made a lot of mistakes.
Why are you shouting?
What's your father's name?
Look over there.
If there's anything I can do, let me know.
We tried.
Tom resigned in October.
The market is near the doctor's house.
Happy Canada Day!
I'll be late.
What does this sign mean?
Tom kept his head shut.
Are we ready?
I like Tom's blueapple.
He was very patient.
How old are you?
Listen to me.
Would you like to go shopping with me?
Slow down.
They're there.
I'll yell.
Everyone's tired.
Don't let me down.
Who was that?
I'm shy.
When I said that Mary had left town, it seemed really surprised to see Tom.
I heard screams.
What time is your plane?
Simony doesn't want to talk about this.
My book seemed interesting.
Tell me what happened.
I'm up to 8 today.
Please burn the light.
Tom's hurt.
I'm still your friend.
It took me more than two hours to translate English.
Are those yours?
Who is this?
Is this the shortest way to get to the station?
Tom tried to kill Mary.
Do you know him?
It's impossible!
How many trains does Yokohama reach?
What time is it?
Don't correct the words that don't correct them, but rather submit them to normal translations.
Your shoes are here.
Are you all ready for tomorrow?
Did anyone leave a report for me?
I want to cook for you.
Excuse me, does this train go to Washington Square?
We're worthless.
This room's AC.
Are you wearing all this?
Tom Boston was gone.
Tell me clearly.
Don't open that.
Tom saw him.
It may wear ice during the evening.
I'm not proud of that.
Is there anyone there?
It's been a mistake.
I'm not young anymore.
He's eating.
It's just blood.
Would you like to go fishing with us?
Just wait here.
I'll be back in 20 minutes.
Wait a minute.
Tom was injured.
Mary explains.
I can't deny it.
Don't look!
End it as soon as possible.
Use it.
How many trains does Yokohama reach?
I don't understand that either.
I'm up to seven this morning.
I'm home.
Slow down.
Merry Christmas!
I'll go in.
Me too.
I'm not too busy.
It's beautiful.
Do it again!
Tom started the kash.
They're children.
I don't want to argue with you.
"Why don't you go?" "Cause I don't want to go."
I know it.
I'll be around.
Call me tomorrow.
Tell me what you want.
My leg hurts.
Ask Tom.
I wonder what I'm gonna give you for your birthday.
Don't forget the ticket.
Good to see you again.
Why are you shouting?
Stay right there.
Eat the food you like.
We used to play in the park.
I'm busy.
Where can I buy a ticket?
I'm done.
I'm planning to stay at the hotel.
I finally got my keys.
Tom started screaming.
I'm not arguing.
Can you read?
How old is your father?
Are you okay?
I've never seen Tom so happy.
Don't come in.
We're lost.
Tom's screaming.
We can still do that.
I tried.
I'm sick.
I'm just looking. Thank you.
Unfortunately it's true.
We've been waiting for them.
How old do I look?
Tom isn't happy here.
He was angry.
I don't like coffee.
Keep your voice down.
Can I get your phone number?
Why do you want to meet Tom?
Here you go.
We don't care what he does.
I called my best friend Tom.
We'll never play better than this.
We're shy.
The bill will be cleared today.
Tomorrow I'm going to Paris.
You'll never be alone.
You can go there.
We both know that this is not right.
Eat whatever you like.
I have wine.
Why was Tom crying?
