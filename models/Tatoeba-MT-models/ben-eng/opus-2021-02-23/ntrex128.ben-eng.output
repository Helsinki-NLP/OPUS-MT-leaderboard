Welsmbly member is concerned about the 'like' of a "welcome"
Several Ambrel members of the MWP (Membre of the Welsh Parliament) are panicking about the change.
The reason for this panic is that Asmeboli's name was changed by a proposal to the Wesh Parliament.
Members of various political parties are afraid of facing ridicule from the change.
A Labor Party member said that his party is worried that "with Twp and Paul with the new position"
For Welsh readers: in the blind language, Twp means a fool and a bop.
One of its members said that they were "not pleased" and offered alternative advice as a team.
Welsh Conservative, a member of the Party, said that the group was watching the change in the name "open" but noted that the accent was slightly different between the MWP and the size of the MWP.
In this sense, the words of Wesh W WW are like the words of the English-language U.S.
The Astemmbly Commission, which is now preparing for the opening of the rename process, said: "The final decision of the Ambly members of the premises, must be taken by the members."
The Govs of Wells Act gives Welsmbly the right to change their name.
In June, the commission published the results of a public opinion where Amembly's name was changed and the proposal of the Welsh Parliament received much support.
Regarding the position of Asmmbly members, the commission is supporting Welsh Parliament and the WMP, but according to John, MWP has the highest support.
Apparently, Ambly members are suggesting different alternatives, but the process will be difficult for Prisoning Officers, Alan Jones, which should be filed within a few weeks.
In this decree, there will be different changes in the process of working as part of the process, including the disproportionateness of members of the committee and design of the committee.
After the debate over the decree, members of the Asyncllimen will receive final vote on what they should be.
Macedonians are voting in a referendum on the country's name change
Voters will be on Sunday to decide whether to change the name of their country into "Republic of North Macedonia".
Greece - a neighboring country with its own Macedonian province - is also a popular vote to avoid a decade-long conflict.
Athens has long claimed that its northern neighbor’s name is a symbol of their claim on the region, and that the country’s European Union and NATO have objected repeatedly to the appeal of members.
Macedonia's president, Jiz Ivanov, who is against the referendum on re-name change, said he would ignore the referendum.
However, supporters of the referendum include Prime Minister Zoran Jav, who thinks the change is an essential step to join the European Union and NATO.
St. Martins’ bells are silent for the Churches of Harlem
"The elderly people I spoke to said that historically there was a church and a bar in each corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Not one of them today."
He said that the matter of getting out of the bar would be understood.
Today, people’s social networks are "in different ways."
"The bars are no longer in the sit-ins where everyone goes on regular basis."
In the church, he is worried that the money sold by property, as long as the leaders do not think, "and sooner or later, they will return where they started."
He added that there could be an apartment building and a construction site in the church where people will live with people who will not help the rest of the buildings in the area.
"The majority of those who buy Condum in these buildings will be white," he said, "and so will they speed up the day of the closure of these churches because most of these people who are still in the church are less likely to become members of the church."
Both churches were established by the white congregation in 1870, and St. Martins after a decade.
The original white methodist congregation left the church in 1930s.
A black congregation in nearby took ownership of the building.
Reverd John Johnson took over a black congregation under St. Martins, who led a boycott against the vendors at the Red Red and Twenty-fifth Street due to the refusal of black workers to pay their jobs and promotion - a major street for Harlem shopping.
The building was badly damaged in 1939, but Father Johnson's Parisians planned to restore it, when they built the Carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson, and heir of St. Martins, gave the Claude an "hour to people".
In July, the expert who played the Carilloni, called it something different: "A historical resource" and "unreal historical instruments."
Experts, Tefini Niyong, from the University of Michigan, also said that it was the environment of a black Bader Bader-of-the-scene world carmoil, dedicated to the Baja Dionio A. Lindio, who was dedicated to playing a bigger carporter than 18 years ago in the city of Riverside.
Mr. Maryweder said that St. Martins didn't replace him.
The events that happened in St. Martins over the past few months have been a complex case of the founders and the taverns, who were appointed by the general church leaders or the APsopal Diariosis.
Vestari - Paris's governoring body, made up of ordinary leaders - was concerned about their concern that in July they would "set up" the Diesy Vestries, although Dito's appointment was not involved in the recruitment and recruitment of the sit-ins.
Some members of Parish have complained about the lack of transparency in her work.
Shark attack in California after 13-year-old Golde shrimping.
A 13-year-old boy was injured by the shark attack after being drowning for the first day of the shrimp season on Saturday, according to officials.
The attack took place at Bisns Beach about 7 a.m. at Ennius.
Chand Halel told San Diego's KSWB TV that he heard him screaming for help for the boy for half an hour on Saturday morning, and he managed to get him out of the water with a group of people.
He first thought that the boy was screaming at a shrimping shrimp, but then he said, "The boy, he was calling me a bite!"
'He bit me!'
Her voice was tearing off her throat," says Halel, and she saw her way to the boy.
"I cry out to everyone to come out of the water: "There are sharks!" Hamel adds.
The boy is taken to the hospital of San Diego , where he is in a terrible condition .
Sharks of the attackers are not known.
Lifegard Captain Larry Ziess said that a shark’s presence in this area was seen a few weeks ago, but it was identified as not dangerous.
Zeyles also said that the infected man was hit by serious injuries on the top of his neck.
Officials have banned access to the beach from Cassablad Beach to Ennus's Swamy for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Zays reports that more than 135 species of sharks are found in the area, most not dangerous.
Sebaris is planning to enter the UK market.
Senseris boots, Superdrags and Debenhams are going to compete with the department store to form a monumental practice in the Isles and the business of shop owners, including experts.
As part of the strong effort to enter the UK’s 2.8 billion nature models, these large models will be opened to 11 shops across the country and will be opened as successful as they prove to be in other shops.
These investments are coming in as supermarkets are looking for new ways to fill their shells with TV, microwaves and homemade materials.
Sensbaris says it will double its shapes to 3,000 goods, which will include Revlon, Ey, Tuyzarman, and Dr. Pot.
There's already a place for austerity range, such as Li'el, Mellin and Barts Beys, which will have a unique place for brands like boots.
Bootsque Mekup range at Supermartity is launching so that most of the products become Vigan Friendly - which has become very popular among young customers.
In addition, the perfumer seller The Frerce Sp would be conducting a test on the distribution of goods to the Sebaris store, first launched last week in South London, and the second in part of the year the Seoli oak in Birmingham.
A small amount of food buys online shopping and local shopping shops means super marketers have to try to get extra time for the customers.
Mike Quae, Chief Executive of the Secretary of State, says that outlets will have to look like the department store since the super market chain is contesting with Alddy and Ledol shops and will have more services and food products.
Two years ago, the company claimed that the company has been bossing the Roggos outlet in hundreds of shops since the Roggos and the Habits chain was bought two years ago, and opened some Habitats and opens, which have made it more profitable and profitable.
The construction of the Supermart and the pharmacy of the farm have failed.
A joint project with the first dull boots of the 2000s, but the project closed down due to the conflict over how to get a share of carts from the supermarkets.
This new trick is taking place after Selencio, the owner of the farm at 281 shops, sold to his farm, Lloyd's farm owner.
The company reported that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding a luxury circuit to the skincarre brand, including La Rovey and the creation of four stores.
Paul Mills-Herx, the commercial director of Sensbaris, said: "We changed our rice - to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest especially in recruitment for trained workers who will attend to advice.
Our brand's range has been designed to satisfy all needs and for the attractive environment and facilities we now have become a reliable platform to challenge shopping methods."
Peter Jones 'immistry' to withdraw from his 11 million pounds deal
TV host Holly Willowby Marxby and ITV to focus on his new agreement with Dragon's Star Peter Jones' Lifestyle brand.
There is no time for their home items and shit brand Truly.
This couple compare the business with Gineth Patolro's spy brand.
This morning's host, 37, reported on Instagram.
Holly WillowB dragons has angered Peter Jones by withdrawing from their interesting lifestyle brands to their last moments of business - focusing on his new bumper agreement with Markers and Spain and ITV.

The business was compared to Goineth Patolro's spy brand and was expected to double the wealth of 11 million pounds of Dometby.
After hearing news of his departure from Trully, 37, Instagram, Jones left Britain in his jets to make his vacation home.
One source said: "So far, Truly was the top of the list.
It was part of his long-term future plans that he would provide for the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw surprised everyone who is concerned about it.
On Tuesday, no one believed that the project was supposed to start soon.
Marol's headquarters has a store full of goods prepared for sale."
Experts believe that the present-time present-day directors of the Britain's most reliable star might have lost millions of pounds of farm because they have already invested in a large investment of products such as candles, clothes and housing items, and that the launch will have to be late.
And that could end a long day's friendship.
Dan Baldwin, her three child's mother, and her husband Dan Baldwin, had been close to Jones and his wife, Taura Cap for over a decade.
There was Truly started with Cap in 2016 and Jones joined as president in March 52.
The two have 40% of Jones shares on the farm, and Baldwin’s TV production.

"I didn't give any rest."
He said that Kim would be interested in meeting their first meeting in Singapore in June after their initial meeting, Trump claimed their first encounter to be a huge step towards nuclear intervention in North Korea.
But the dialogue of nuclear intervention has gone viral.
More than three months after the Singapore summit, North Korea's top diplomats Ri Young Ho told the world leaders on Saturday that North Korea's previous unrest has not seen a "related response" towards the US.
However, he said the US ban on pressure.
Trump expressed a more positive view during his speech at his rally.
"We are in good position with North Korea," he says.
"We faced a battle with North Korea.
It could have killed a million people.
Now we have great connection."

And she supports her unique approach to her relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to treat the president, but it's only 200 people standing out of this crowded area to try to get into it," Trump points out his finger to the crowd in front of him.
An island destroyed by tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia, hundreds killed
After the looming earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they don't need help.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lombre were displaced, no national disaster was announced, a premise for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they are very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so challenge it" Ms. Sambaang reported.
Although a team of foreign workers can work in the field, it is still not sure whether Save the Children will be able to move.
Mr. Sutopo, the spokesman for the National Disasters Association, said that foreign agencies are assessing the situation of the Indonesian officials to determine whether they will be allowed to participate in relief efforts.
Despite the regular quakes in Indonesia, the country is unhappy with the nature's anger.
Although the tsunami shelters in Aché were set up, the site of shelters in other coastal areas was set up.

The statue of the Parliament of Cocowell is the new victim of the ‘hit of history’
The statue will be removed after the destruction of the multicultural and religious symbols of England by pro-Jamaat followers.
But Cocowell Society announced Mr. Bakir's advice to be "discipline" and "trying to rediscover the history".
The president of the Cocowell Society, John Goldsmith, said: "It was inevitable that the statue of Olive Cruzwell, outside the western Palace of Coalton, would have been the target of the statue of Olive Cotwell, which was set up outside the western Palace in the wake of the detonator's removal.

Mr. Goldmmeth at The Sunday Telegraph said: "Many people consider Cocowell to be the guardian of parliament by the face of external pressure, against the pressure of the monarchy - which is now less than a few people's opinion in 19th century.
But whether it is a complete correct picture of the time, which is part of an ongoing historical debate.
What is sure is that the conflict in the 17th century has led to the next development of our nation, and Roswell is a well-known character representing a party of the department.

They bite little bites, very interested creatures... but they don't try to hurt anyone.
But you have to go on with them enough," he says.
Hurricane Rosa's remnant will create heavy rains across the United States
For example, Hurricane Rosa is weakening the power of the cyclone as it sails over cooler waters in the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will be flooded by the northern part of Mexico and the western part of the United States.
During the morning of Sunday, at 5:30am, Rosa had 1 hurricane wreath with 85 miles an hour, and a 385 miles from Piña Eugeneia in Mexico.
Rosa should be heading north on Sunday.
On the other hand, a method has begun to form in the Pacific Ocean and is heading west to the West Coast of the United States, which hits the California coast on Monday and leads to the United States in the deep tropical north of the United States.
Rosa's cause will rain up to 10 inches in different parts of Mexico on Monday.
After that, heavy rains will be caused by heavy rains in the southmost part of the day, linking to the deep tropical growth.
Rains from 1 to 4 inches from locally to 4 inches will lead to flash flashing or flash flood, destruction flows, and possible landslides in the desert.
Due to deep dystrophy, rain levels can be between 2 and 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of South Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to rain from 2 to 4 inches in several parts of the south, especially in Arizona.
Flash flashing and fast can be a way to reduce the situation because of the slowness of waterfalls.
It would be stupid to walk out of the desert on foot under the threat of water.
Heavy rains can make the Canyon turn into a dangerous river, and the storms with strong winds.
This will result in heavy rains locally in various parts of the southern California coastal region.
The amount of rain may reach half an inch, which can lead to small ruins of street congealed roads.
It will be the first rain season in the region.

He was standing down for a few minutes in the face of criticism from the protesters, which was broadcast directly on CNCN.
"I am standing right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think Kevana is telling the truth to the country?
He is called "You have the power, when many women are helpless."
FFC says that his office issued a statement and said there was more to him in the committee hearing.
Later, when the Judyasiri committee voted for the full Senate nominee to proceed, all of the cables and broadcast networks were live.
But FFC says he will vote on the condition that the FBI will investigate the charges against the chosen person next week, which are being addressed by minorities.
The conversation with Democratic Senator Chris Coun has had a partial impact.
After talking to Kun, Flesh spoke to several other senators and reached his conclusions.
Induced by the Swedish decision, it was clear that the Republicans did not vote for Kevana without investigation.
President Trump has launched a FBI investigation based on charges against Cavana.

And that trick came to an important goal.
Rangers concorded a free-key and opened the leadbook, Deklan Galgar and Robinson Minga, who scored the center of a touch box.

Incredible 'commun' analysis
BBC's Lamont Tony McArni in Alasia, Scotland
An extraordinary performance and results for Livingston.
For one person, they were awesome, continuing beyond the expectations of everyone at their own pace.
Since returning to the top, their game style and player has rarely changed, but credit must be to the side of the team he has made since he arrived.
He was a lot of heroes.
Captain Halket was amazing, built a tremendously organized defense, and kept Manga Connor Goldson and Joe Warll always.
Although Rangers were less inspired.
Under Gerard, they fell down the standards they were good.
They lacked the answer - only once they opened the welcomeers - and it is a warning for Rangers who are at the table right now.
Erdogan's got mixed-up.
The situation was very happy when Turkey and German leaders met in Berlin on Saturday (September 29).
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at repairing the relationship between the NATO coalition.
They debate human rights, press freedom, and the participation of Turkey's EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne for the opening of a new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police have managed to prevent the 25K people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters came to visit their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, including many Kurdishs - were heard their voices condemning Erdogan's policies and the decision to welcome him to Germany.
This conflict proves to be evidence that a visitor is praised by the Germans as heroes and condemned by others as dictators.

Thousands gathered at the beach in Palu City on Friday evening in which six meters (18 feet) of higher waves broke down on the coast, which led to the death of many people and destroyed everything on the road."
The tsunami came after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"The people continued their activities at the beach during the recent tsunami threat, and those who did not immediately run away and became victims," said the Indonesian disaster disaster spokesman Sutopo Públiho, a Brifanho spokesman in Jakarta.
"Sunami didn't come from cars, logs, houses, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nughuho adds, “the tsunami traveled at an hour before the speed of 800 km (497 miles) hit the shores.
Some people came to the tree to escape the tsunami and they survived,
About 16,700 people were moved to Palu's 24 centers.
The images from the sky, published by the disaster agency, show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges down and down to a mosque.
Aftershocks travel on Saturday in the coastal city.
The series of earthquakes felt in the region of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Alliance and Application (BPP) issued a statement that nearly 200 times the power of nuclear bombs released by Friday's massive earthquake in Hiroshima.
The geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow Gulf, can increase the size of the tsunami
Nuseho described the damage as "poke" that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping and hotels were broken.
Some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed building, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 missing."
Nusegho reports that the casualties can be even higher in Dingala, a region near the coastal point of the coast, over 300 kilometers (190 km) from Palhua.
The communications system "was completely crippled without any information" Ngugroho said.
"Red Cross issued a statement, and adds that workers and volunteers are going to the affected region."
"It is already a tragedy but it could be even worse."
The agency has been widely criticized for not reporting the data because of the tsunami Palu, although officials said the waves came when the warning was issued.
One of the people on the ground, shared on social media, has been heard by a tsunami warning people on the following street.
Within minutes, a wall of water hit the shores, and the building and car swept away.

President Joko Widododo was supposed to visit Palu's shelters on Sunday.
The number of people killed in a tsunami in Indonesia has reached 800.

According to Mr. Dosse, as the World Organization staff were going safely from Dingala to Palu, where employees were sheltering in the yards of their office, they saw the destruction on the way.
Dossa also said, "They saw many houses destroyed."
It's sad.

The change was revealed before his presence on the Night Live, where he hoped to reveal his new album, Yondu.
The producer said that he would replace the performer, Ariana Grande, who cancelled the event "in the emotional state."
West earlier said that the word was religious, as well as its present professional form.

"So I'm you, I'm ours, that's us.
This is said to be said from Cain, which means the only person, Yes, reflects our good, bad, our confusion, everything.

Sean Combles is known in various ways as Paof Daddy, PD or DDD, but this year he announced that he likes profit and brother-in-laws.
J-G, a former associate of West, has been working with Hafen, Hifen, and the capital.
Mexican ALWA has vowed not to allow military force on ordinary Mexican citizens.
Mexican president Andrés Manuel Lopez vowed to mark the 50th anniversary of violent torture against students that he will not force military force against citizens.
López Obrado promised on Saturday that "the military will not use force to torture the Mexican people".
On October 2, 2000, soldiers shot at peaceful protests that killed 300 people while the leftist student movement in Latin America was building strong positions.

The United States should offer double funds to artificial intelligence.
As China has become more active with artificial intelligence, the United States needs to double its cost in research, says artificial intelligence professionals and investors Kai-fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft, and Eman.
This statement comes from different parts of the government, declared in the United States that the U.S. has a formal strategic shortage of intelligence in artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China launched its new plan last year: its goal is to acquire number 1 of artificial intelligence in 2030.
“The double budget will be a good start in the research of the Diary Sciences, where most countries are far behind in this case, and we are looking for the next step towards progress in artificial intelligence.”
Double funds can double the potential of the next big artificial intelligence in the United States, according to Lee in an interview with the CBC this week.
Lee, whose book "All Superpasieves": "China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" is the chief executive of Hwton Miflin Harcot, Sinnova Veteran, China's leading artificial intelligence organization Fache+.
In the 1980s, Carnegi Melon worked on an artificial intelligence system that defeated the most powerful American player in the UK and was then president of Microsoft Research and Google's China branch.
The former US government's technology competition, like Lee Defense Advanced Research Project, admits to the next step.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to win, says Lee.
"China is not taking away academic leaders; corporates are giving," Lee says.
Facebook, Google, and other technology organizations have been recruiting students from universities to work in artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee says the changes in immigration policies can help increase the efforts of AI in the United States.
"I think the Green Card should automatically offer it to the Ph.D. in artificial intelligence", he said.
The Chinese State Council of State issued a plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence development in July 2017.
China’s National Institute of Natural Sciences, such as National Science Foundation and other government agencies, provide funding to US researchers, but China has less than the value of academic work, says Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint artificial intelligence center, which has announced the formation of the White House Committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DRPA announced 2 billion investments in an initiative called Latin Next.
As NSF, it currently invests more than 100 million dollars per year in artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Act, which seeks to form artificial intelligence, has not been seen in months.
Macedonians voted in the referendum on whether to change the name of the country
On Sunday, the Macedonian people voted on a referendum on whether to keep its name in the Republic of North Macedonia, a step that blocked the efforts of several decades-old conflicts with Greece to get a member member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where Macedonia has a province, represents a claim of its territory and the entry of NATO and the European Union.
Two governments have made a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opposition thinks that the change will undermine the ethnicity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Jij Ivanov said he won't vote in the referendum and suspected whether the re-election should be legal for 50 percent of the necessary referendum.
The question was in the referendum ballot: "You are for the Natsudians and members of the European Union, with the recognition of the deal with Greece."
Supporters of change, including Prime Minister Zoran Jav, have argued to pay the price of entry to the European Union and NATO Organization for Macedonia, one of the most wanted countries in the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I am here to vote for young people in Macedonia for the future of the country, so that they can live freely in the shadow of the European Union because it means safe for us all," said Oliveira Giizevska, 79 years old.
However, the members of the parliament said they would accept the results of the decision by making a decision.
Two-thirds of the majority is needed in parliament to change the name.
The State Election Commission said there were no reports of 1,00 p.m. in the country.
However, only 16% compared to 34% of the 2016 National Assembly election, when 66% of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, we have our place in Europe," said José Teenovski, one of the voters in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Jav, his wife, and his son, Zharko Macedonia, voted on a referendum to change the country's name, which will open the way to NATO and joining the European Union in Macedonia on 30 September, 2018.
Vladimir Kavardkov, 54-year-old, was preparing a small stage in front of the Parliament in Skopje and drew chairs in front of those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to raise our heads, not through the doors of the service," said Kavderovskov.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can go to others like China and Russia and be part of the Euro-Esia solidarity."
Prime Minister Jabyev said that NATO membership will bring the necessary investment in Macedonia, with more than 20 percent of the unemployment rate.
"I believe there will be a huge majority favor because more than 80% of our citizens are in favor of the European Union and NATO," Javed said after his ballot.
He said that a "yes" result would be a confirmation of our future.
According to a survey published by the Institute for Policy Research in Macedonia last Monday, 43% of voters will be participating in the referendum under the necessary turn out.
Another poll, conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, shows 57% of the respondents planning to vote on Sunday.
About 70 percent said they would vote yes.
The referendum needs to be more than 50% of the votes to succeed.
The failure of the referendum will lead to the death of the pro-government policy since taking power in May.
See: Get into the whole Braton Defense for Serio Aguo goal in Manchester City
Braton's victory over Manchester City, Manchester, in Manchester, England on Saturday, ended in decried Serio Agustio Agustero and Thrim Steinne, winning a 2-0-0 difference in Manchester City.
Aguro made it easier to see his score in 65th minute.
At the beginning of the sequence, Argentina has received a pass at the Midfield.
Before he went to the open field, he ran through three Broton defenders.
Aguero was then surrounded by four Green Jerseys.
He turned a defender before several others crossed the end of the Braton box.
Then he pushed a pass to the left, which found Sterling.
Using his first touch in the English Forward box, he returned the ball to Agureo, who was using his right boot to shoot Matthew Ryan, the Braton Protector, and beat him right next to the net.
"Aguro is fighting some problems on his feet," City Manager Pippe Gardola told journalists.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are lucky he scored a goal at that moment."
Berlin, however, gave Sky Blues the initial advantage of the League's fight.
The goal came at 29 minutes.
Aguero got the ball in the center of the Briton region.
He sent the ball to Lion on the left side of the right side.
He took a couple of touch before he was moved to a long post.
Just before Sky Blue Forward passed the limit, he put it on the net.
In the group of City's champions, Hfffenheim will fight the Hafenhym on Tuesday 12:55 in Germany's Rain-Nakar-Anrem, Germany.
Sherzar Spiler wants to play Rocks at the match.
There was not much reason to force the nationals to start other things after they removed the debate from the playlists.
However, forever contestants hope that he will be taking action against Colorado Rocky in Sunday, if only then the effects of the One-Greme Lead to the LL's Los Angeles Lengeers in Los Angeles.
Rockis had at least a wild card victory at least by 5-2 side on Friday night, but they still want to achieve their first division.
"Even though we're not playing for anything, at least we can step on the rubber with Denver's viewers and maybe the other party knows what level I'm facing this year.
"Why wouldn't I want to compete?"
Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but it has been said that Shezar can start off in such a situation.
Sherzar, who starts his 34th session on Thursday and throws him off on Sunday.

Trump rally in West Virginia
In the mid-election elections, the president referred to his Supreme Court's election as a focus to the situation around Bront Carvana.
"All we did is at risk in November.
Five weeks from one of our most important elections.
It's a big, big - I'm not running, but I'm really running in every place to fight for the great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this horrible, dangerous group of democrats, you see it happen right now."
And they are determined to take back any means they need to take back the strength they need, you see the lowness, the arrogance they need.
They don't care who they are hitting, power and control, they only want strength and control, we don't give it to them."
He says the Democratics are on missions to "stop and prevent."
"And you can see that for the last four days," he says, the Democratics called "fifty and hateful and unfaithful."
He called the Democratic Senator of the Senate's Department of Justice to the Democratic Committee of the Senate, which received a loud voice from the audience.
"Do you remember the answer?
Did you leak the documents?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting - this was really the bad body - the worst body I've ever seen.
Labor is not an independent organization.
Those who say what is in their minds are not allowed here.
When my party men in Mastam blamed me for voting, it was no surprise.
Because your mind won't be welcomed by Bola’s style - I was the last Labor MP to inform you.
My parliamentary colleague, Juan Ryan, had a similar attitude because he stood up against Jewishism.
In my case, I was accused of disagreeing with Jeremy Jabin.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, about Europe and national protection, and similar issues, Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
Friday, Notingham stated at the East Labor Meeting that "we want to include and promote meetings."
As local Labor MP in eight years, this is the first time that the GC meeting took place on Friday.
Unfortunately, today, it is not the sound of the meeting, and it has been forgotten for a long time by "please," politics, if it ever begins.
It has been increasingly evident that dissent in the Labor Party is not tolerated and each opinion is judged as whether it is acceptable for party leadership.
It started shortly after he became the leader of Jeremy, who I thought I had the same political views as they began to hope for me and to say that I would not be willing to take a stand that would be national security or EUUU is a single market.
Every time I speak openly - and even though what I say doesn't come, there was a call to remove my removal by social media, the center's politics was condemned, and I was told that I shouldn't be in the Labor Party.
And this is not just my own experience
In fact, I know that I am more lucky than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed to me are political too.
I am surprised to see colleagues who are facing a daily wave of discrimination or racist violence, but I am never ashamed of their professionalism and determination.
The most frustrating aspect of this era of politics is how the rate of glamour has become normal.
Jeremy Corbin last week claimed that the Labor Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer a free-minded organization, and each "emergency" vote or change the party's rules.
Over the last two years, I've been asking many to keep my head down, not become so loud and that I'll be "right"
But I've come to politics, not to do this.
When I joined the Labor School as a school student 32 years ago, we were provoked by the negligence of the government which literally destroyed our extensive school classrooms, I tried to provide the necessary public service, whether it is the local council or the government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, including the last election.
No one in the East was ever confused about my policies and the fields of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who broadcast the Friday movement, I only want to say that while the country is heading towards a brakes that will affect families, businesses and our public service leaders, I don't know how to waste my time and energy.
But I really don't have a message for Natingham Momentam, whether it is a Laborman or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that any impotent threat or political initiative that will not prevent me from believing that is the best for all.
Chris Lesley Notingham is an MP to the East.
Ir 38-17 Meloz: Rise of Unnewed Income
Lately, two attempts can reduce the gap between the final results, but no doubt the great entertainment puller of this day was qualified to win the title of the summit.

The 14th minute attempt by Grant Anderson to transform Frazier's income into a yellow card by Frazier Clermo, but a yellow card by Scotland's player Rory Hughes that drove him out for the game with Warers, gave him the majority, and tried to break Jason's bag.
Clomo Penalty raised the lead of income, just before, at halftime, he turned it into 17-5 in one single effort.
However, Melruz started with the second round, and Patrick Anderson’s attempt to convert the gap into five points of intervals.
Then, for long time, the Raguad Nott, who went on a stretcher and went on to earn more than once again with St.ford McDondov's attempt to transform it into clean-up.
Aya’s captain, Blair McFarson, got yellow card when he was hit by a serious pressure and once again, Melruzze Bruce Colvin’s efforts to get extra player.
Although the welcome Ra has come back, and when Stualan Tston saw the yellow card to deal with it without the ball, he turned it out of the penal line and moved it back to Makfarson's mall.
Cloom changed, when Kyle Ro, David Armstrong’s box kit, sent Henry to the fifth try to go home.
Still playing star restaurants are ready for new careers in the industry.

Evo Morales, Bolivia's Caribbean President - who will face a controversial fight for the next year's reelection - has much to do with the verdict on Monday.
"We are very close to the Pacific Ocean," he promised in late August.
Some analysts, however, believe that the court does not have the chance to make a decision in favor of Bolivia - and if that happens, it will change little.
The Netherlands-based UN-based organization does not have the power to give Chile a territory and points out that it will not determine the results of possible discussions.
The final argument that ICJ's verdict came only six months after hearing the final argument indicates that the case was "not as simple as it was," said the Chilean international law expert Pásierate.
And it could be backed up in the last four years than to move on to Bolivia's cause further.
"The entry of the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," says Jorenet.
He said that the anti-war speech in Moras has offered any welcomes from Chile.
As far as Bolivia and Chile can continue to talk, it will be very difficult to discuss later.
Two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1997.
The Hague's representative, Eduardo Rodriguez Vetzy, rejected the court's decision to act as unusually fast.
Monday, Bolivia's "a great opportunity for a new era" and "to put an end to the 139 years of controversy with the polygamism," he says.
Calzadila also denied that Morales is still using the issue as a political fence, as one of the most popular presidents in Latin America.
"Bolivia will never leave the right to enter the Pacific," he adds.
"The opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past"
North Korea says that nuclear evictions will not come until they trust the United States.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho said that if he cannot trust Washington, his nation will not be forced to intervene first.
He said on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to comply with a promise made by rival leaders at a summit in Singapore.
His comments came when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompo, in northern Korea, seems to have been on the road to re-open the nuclear deal with Singapore over three months later.
Ri says it is a "Pip Dream" that continues the ban and the U.S. object to North Korea's objection to the end of Korean war.
Washington is warning that the announcement may first agree with the announcement without the process of not being implemented by pongyang.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second convention.
However, there is widespread suspicion that Pyongyang is serious about leaving a weapon that the country is perhaps the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pyongongong wants to travel next month to prepare for the second Kim-Tramp meeting.
The Paris Fashion shows reveal the latest line of giant heads in a high street near you.
No need to see if you want to raise your hat or block the whole sun.
Designed designer Valencia and Thim Brown revealed a trend of oversized head gear to collect their S199 on the runway, which shocked style sets in Paris fashion week.
This summer, the highly absurd hat is on Instagram, and the designers sent the puzzle to Catwa.
The one of the creations of Valencia was a over-the-top top hat that was decorated with wide wings like feathers that covered the heads of the models.
Among other overrided melons, one wizard's hat even includes one of the archives - but they aren't designed to keep your head warm.
Tham Brown also published a choice of the weird mask - and the perfect time for Halloween.
A lot of colourful masks were similar to hannybal Laketer compared to the horrible fun they had.
A creation snowcake and Golgols are similar to Scruba diving gear, the other one looks like anything else.
And if you continue the massive fashion statement - you're lucky.
Style observers predict that big woods may go to the high Street of yours.
Outsized hats compete with 'La Bombay', two-foot-fifty straw hats that each of them had to wear from Ryana to Emily's cousinskovsky.
The black label behind the highly absurd hat was sent by Catwa another large creation - a stretcher bag that is almost as big as a swimming suit model.
The orange Rafiya bag of Paris Fashion We gathered in La Rivera in Jacki's La Rivera, along with the Riffaf Puffing and a top white skin code, was one of the first.
Sellebrist Luke Armies informs the armed letter: "I hope the big hats and beaches will be coming to High Street next summer - as designers have had such a huge impact on the needs of overrided needs."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for world citizens
The independent schools of Scotland have maintained a track record of academic excellence, and in 2018, it continued with yet another outstanding test of violence, sports, art, and other communities that have been firmly established by personal and collective efforts of individuals and communities.
These schools, represented by more than 30,000 students across Scotland, were tried to provide their students and parents with the best level service.
The independent schools aim to provide more and more education for their students, their chosen profession, and their place as world citizens.
As an educational field that can design and implement a special school textbook, we see modern languages as popular and favourites in schools.
Nelson Mandela says: "If you speak to a person with a language he understands, it's in his head.
If you speak to her in your own language it goes to her heart."
It is a powerful reminder that if we want to create relationships and trust with other people, we can't just rely on English.
From the recent results of this year's experiment, we can see that the highest level of letters are at the League tables with the highest score in the individual schools.
A total of 68 per cent of foreign language students achieved higher grades.
A total of 74 members of the SCIS school reported that 72 percent of students achieved higher grades in the Mandarin when 72% of German studies, 69% of French studies, and 63 percent of Spanish studies were made.
It proves that the independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Language is now a choice, as a way to choose the unique school textbook and somewhere else to do the same (tech, engineering and math).
A study conducted by the UK Commission for Development and Skies 2014 found that 17 percent of the workers blame the lack of language skills in the fight against zero.
More and more, the youth are becoming essential in preparing for their future career.
These skills are essential in order to provide more potential opportunities for which languages are needed.
Anyone who chooses a career, if they learn a second language, will have a real advantage in the future.
It is possible to communicate directly with foreign people before they compete.
In 2013, more than 4,000 adults in Egov: 75% of them were not able to speak a foreign language well during the conversation, and French language was the only decade-old language, 15 percent.
This is why investing in language education is important for today's children.
There are multiple languages, especially developing economy, to give children better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will separate them from the languages they teach.
Several schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while 2020 are seen as the most important language in the region, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a lot of languages to choose the independent schools, including experts.
The Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing an environment for education that will prepare children and create the necessary skills to succeed in the future.
In business around the world, it can't be denied any moment that languages play an important role in the future of the country, so it should reflect on education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be considered as "the skill of international communication."
The unique schools provide the same choices, diversity, and hospitality for young people in Scotland.
It must be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scots Council of Independence School.

YouTube channel during the rally in West Virginia, Trump
President Donald Trump stormed the night's march at the wheeling of West Virginia.
It's the first time in five Tiffiles next week, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
As he has been able to ensure that his vote for the emptyness of the Supreme Court, Trump is in support of the Central-Meddi election, as Republicans risk losing control of the Congress in November.
What happened tonight at Trump's West Virginia rally and how do you see it online?
Trump's wheeling is scheduled at 7:00 p.m., the ET Saturday night, September 29, 2018.
You can view the West Virginia rally below the live stream on YouTube.
Trump probably spoke this week about the Supreme Court's appointed candidate, Bret Catvana's hearing, which has been fueled by an expected Senate vote of sexual abuse during the FBI investigation.
However, the initial goal of these gatherings is to help the Republicans face some speed facing the November elections.
Thus, President Trump's campaign stated that the five rallies in the next week were "to force and support supporters, as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority under the Senate and representatives," according to Reuters.

According to Reuters, President Simon Heder, a West Virginia university politician, said, "It's not very good for Morriy to try to encourage him to run for elections."
Rider Cup 2018: The hunger to keep our hope in a single room on Sunday
At the end of the three unconstitutional session, the 4am cup was needed by Rider.
The ottering ostensibly of Pandam's Pandam is a complete sporting idea, but the players really believe in it, and the biggest in the national competition.
So where are they gonna tell me now, Momentsam?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so I think we have a little ladder," Jordan Spoith told us to walk for the day.
Europe has benefits, of course, there are four points leading to the game.
As Seth said, Americans feel that they have some assistance on their way and that they can be encouraging, especially in the form of Spoth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and took three points from four to three points.
Seth was deadly from the beginning to the end and leading from the front.
He was loud and louder in celebrating his rounds, when he and Thomas were behind two points behind, making an important leap for the entire four points of match.
The student who won the match on 15th gets the same scream as you say he believes that the American team is not out of it.
"You really have to go deep and think about your match," Seth said.
This player is all of it now.
18 holes to make a mark.
Over the past two days more than Spiath and Thomas, the players were just FrenchSyscomi and Tommy Flatwood, Rider Cup.
The strangest of Europe but Arzu Zül doesn't make any mistakes from four and no mistakes.
The "Molywood" was the only pair who did no boggle on Saturday afternoon, but on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and Friday.
The run, and the way their power flows from the crowd and flows from the crowd, it seems that they have no other popular player than the beating player on Sunday, and the setting of the sun at Le golf National or the European victory, without darkness.
It would be better if both of you were in different holes at the same time.
However, European glory has gone from time to time.
When Alex Neren was paired with Burba Watson and the web Simpson morning ballball had something to do with Cerzio García.
In the first nine, a Boggi and two double Colombians threw Swelfth and Sweedy into a hole where they never got up.
On Sunday, though, there's nobody here to get you out of your hole.
Companies between paired, suggest that they don't suggest, and that strategy can change immediately is very interesting and 4am from around.
Europe has played as a better team so far and has taken an important lead on the final day, but this Forsam session has also proved that Team USA has the desire to fight, especially for Statesides.
On the final day of Rider Cup, Europe took 10-6 lead.
On Saturday’s final day of Rider Cup, Europe will take healthy advantage of the 10-6 intervals against the United States from Fourball and Forsam to the United States.
Strategically paired Tommy Flatwood and Franceskol Mossuky took them to the golf National point in the second round of victory against the Tiger Woods.
Thomas Zerborne's European team, whom two years ago, has been bled to restore the lost Tropical Tropical Tropical Tropical, won the series 3-1-1.
America offered more resistance to two matches in Forsam, but they couldn't meet the shortage.
The team needs eight points from the 12 single matches on Sunday to the return of the Trophy.
Flatwood, the first European Runi and Uribe, was the first pair to score four points from the first four points in the history of the Cup of Rider Cup after a remarkable weekend.
Woods and Patrick Reed, they then sentenced a lost Woods and American Russs to severe jail by 5 and 4.
On Saturday, the Woods stormed himself into the middle of two matches but he lost 19 matches between his Fourballs and 29 matches.
Justin Rose, resting for Morning Fourball, returned to Henry Markson's partner, Henry Johnson, and Brooks Johnson, 2 and 1 in the world and one in three.
A pleasant, wind day in Paris, the southwestern part of Paris, although it wasn't in Europe.
Three major champions of Jordan Sparta and Justin Thomas set up a scale for Americans on Saturday with two points.
They won 2 and 1 strong win against the Spain Zone Ram and Yan Polter, and came back to defeat two of the openings at Forsam and Rri McColer in 4 and 3.
Only two days in the history of Rider Cup, a team has returned from four points of crisis, although there is only one need for drawbacks to the party's Trophy.
After being the second of two days, however, Sunday's counter attack seems to be going beyond them.
North Korea says "no way" will remain unsatisfied without faith.
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the existing ban has deepened disbelief in the United States and that the country has no choice to release nuclear weapons in such a national situation.
In the annual General Assembly of the Ri Young Ho global organization, North Korea took a remarkable wish "to stop nuclear and missile testing last year, break down the nuclear testing system, and not promise to increase nuclear technology and nuclear weapons."
"But we didn't see a similar reaction in the United States," he said.
"If there is no confidence in the United States, we will have no confidence in our national protection, and we have no choice to destabilize ourselves in this national situation."
Although North Korea's complaints against the retroversial nuclear chaos in Washington were describing North Korea's slow action, his statement was significant because he did not leave the nuclear disorder totally, since Pyongiang had done it in the past.
At the first meeting of the United States President and North Korean Leader, Kim Zun Nie and Donald Trump, in Singapore, mentioned a joint statement that Kim promised to work on "the nuclear intervention of the island of Koirier," when Trump confirmed Korean protection.
North Korea is looking for an official end to the war of 1950-53 Korea, but the US said Pyongyang must first leave his nuclear weapon.
Washington has also resisted calls to lax international sanctions on North Korea.
They also objected to the announcement of "The United States "encouraged the first" and forced the pressure to achieve its objectives, even "the end of the war", saying.
"The orders may risk us to the ground, the idea of those who don't know about us is a useless dream.
However, the problem is that the ban continues to deepen our disbelief."
The United Nations did not comment on the plans of the second summit between Ri Kim and Trump.
In exchange for the last five months, Kim and South Korea's South Korea's leader, Moon Zain, highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korea, saying: If the issue had been in South Korea, it wouldn't have been so difficult to destabilize Korean territory."
Nevertheless, the Surrey of Riy’s speech was dramatic last year, when he told the UN General Council that the mainland had been targeted by North Korean rockets as "Mrville President" Trump was suicideally called "Corte Man".
In the United Nations, Trump threatened to destroy North Korea last year, he praised Kim for his courage to take over the containment, but said that there is still much work to do, and that the ban will continue to exist until North Korea is unsatisfied.
On Wednesday, Trump said that it doesn't matter if it takes two years, three or five months.
China and Russia argued that Pyongyang should be rewarded for the move taken by the USN Security Council
However, the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pampio told Americans on Thursday that "the restrictions on the Protection Council must continue effectively until we fully verify the complete disappearance."
Security council in Pyongong-Yong has repeatedly promoted restrictions on North Korea since 2006 to stop funding for nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pimply, the General Assembly of the United Nations met with ZEA and later said that he would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second conference.
Pompo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip is not good.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said that some progress was made, only hours before North Korea condemned him as "grugged"!
North Korea has promised a missile site and a nuclear complex this month to break down if the United States adopts "civilization".
She said that the "works" Kim called her looking for her was a safety guarantee in Singapore and guarantees her safety with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a lot of rest.
This year, a new course at Harvard University gives the students a better way to get more sleep in order to cope with the rising night culture of the people who have spent the night studying.
One academic found that the world's number of university students around the world are often confused with the basics about how to care for themselves.
Charles Seizila, a professor of medical school at Harvard Medical School and expert at Brigdy and a female hospital, created this course, believing that this was the first time in the United States.
After giving a speech about the lack of sleep, he was inspired to start the course.
‘ At the end of this, a girl approached me and said: ‘ Why have I been told this so long, my senior year? ’
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep - something that surprised me, "he was telling the Telegraph.
This course for the first time starting this year helps students to learn how to sleep with good habit academics and antric Permans, as well as how to improve their normal health.
At Harvard Medical School, professor and executive director of the University of Health, Paul Baraira said that the university decided to launch the course this week after the students were seriously deprived of their sleep.
The one hour long course contains a list of work related to the task.
A section has a student dormroom image, where students will learn about the impact of Caafine and light by clicking on coffee cups, screens, and books, and how the shortage of Athic Permans is affected by the lack of sleep and the importance of a Bedtime routine.
In another section, the participants are told how long sleep can lead to heart attack, stroke, frustration, and cancer.
A map of campuses with an interactive icon, and then the participants encouraged them to think about their daily routines.
'We know it won't change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know, as you decided to smoke cigarettes, there is a right to know the impacts on health," adds Professor Sisila.
He says the culture of being awake is still alive, adding that the growing pressure on modern technology and students is a growing problem.
You should be a student's 's secret weapon' to fight against your well-being tired, fatigue and anxiety, he says - even sleepy brain makes them hungry, hungry them constantly."
Raymond Soe, 19-year-old at California's chemical and physical biological studies, also helped Professor Cizila to design the course, as well as a class during his first year in Harvard last year.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to a campus-wide course.
In the next step, he hopes that all post-students will ask for a study program before attending a competitive organization.
Professor Seizila recommended that students consider setting up a reminder for when to go to bed and when to wake up, and the effects of 'silly light' by passing screen and LED light, which may cause you to be aware of the effects of the harmful effects of 'silent light', causing you to die while you are sleeping.
Gladys 1 - Rangers: defeating the Shire of the Manga Goald.
The Rangers saw a loss in another Allway match after being defeated near the random team of Stephen Zerard, who lost 1-0.
After the 4-1 victory in Johnston, February, the Ebrox team was looking at another victory, but Gary's team gave him the second defeat as the manager of the 18th match, which led him to the start of the Battle of Ledorbrürvard's eight points.
Menga was hit at half-time minutes ago, but hopeless Rangers never gave up on them.
Rangers have moved down to the sixth place, the third place, and the goal is behind Hyberian.
And there could be more trouble for Rangers because linesman Calam Spain had to be treated for an object that was not caught on the way.
The Gerard team has changed eight changes that have raised the top of the Betfrred Cup.
On the other hand, Livi went with 11 which took a point from his heart last week and he was supposed to be proud of the way his armed team stopped the opponent.
Rangers may have control over the rings, but Hasin did more with their force.
They should have been scored in just two minutes, but the middlefield destroyed his big opportunity.
Keghan Jacobs found a long free-key captain, kreg Hapocket, but his defense partner Alan Lithgo was able to kill the ball in the back post.
The Rangers were re-manded, but the finals were more than the faith of their game.
Alfred Morlos, of course, felt that he should have been in the quarter-awar where he was due to the clashes between him and Stephen Lauss, but Stephen Stephen Thompson rejected the request for Colombia.
Rangers can only target two shots at the top, but former Ethiopian goalkeeper Liyam Kesana Kulti, head and Ovi Eserya's shot were little trouble.
Livi's 34-minute opening goal may have been against the current, but no one can deny that they were the only ones to play their design game.
Once again, Ranger Jacobs had failed to solve the dup-peace set.
Scott andfield didn't react to Scott Robinson’s ball slot, but he kept his head cool to choose Menga for a simple selection.
The girlard break took place instead of Ryan Kent and this change was going to take place almost immediately as the Wengerty was in Moreles, but the extraordinary Kely took him off to the block from the line.
However, the only type of game that the Mandarin visitors enjoy was sending the ball after the long term of Lithgo and Halocket.
The team of Nd would have been able to move to their final stage, but it was before McCrudo Jacobs stood up to make his attempt to destroy the corner of Lithgo.
The Substition of Glen Middleton, a range of Rangers claiming to be stumbling with Jacobs, has once again returned to Glenn Middleton to demand that they run away from him.
Almanak: The discovery of Guyga counter.
And now we have a page from "Monak" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago... on the day when scientist Johans Wilhelm was born in Germany in the future.
Gagar developed a system to identify radiation and measure the measure, an invention that eventually became known as the Gaga counter.
Since then, Gaga’s counter counter was also based on a pop culture, in the 1950s' "Bils of Corona" movie, seemingly unlikely scientist Roy Rogers and Del Evans:
Man: "What's that?"
Rogers: "It's a Gagar counter, it's used to identify radiation minerals such as Idea.
When you give these yearphones a bride, you can hear the effects of radiation on the minerals."
"What does this say?"
"Hance" Gagar died in 1945 shortly before her 63th birthday.
But it's still alive to discover his name.
The vaccine for new cancer can be identified by the Imun system.
The vaccine for new cancer can be identified and killed by the Imun system.
The vaccine teaches me to identify mymun systems as a part of medical treatment.
The system includes removing preventive cells from patients and changing them into labs.
Then they can 'see' a simple protein for so many cancers and then rediscover it.
A test Vicin has shown a sense of optimism to patients with various levels of cancer.
Viccin is a woman who has taught the Imun system to identify the sick cells, she has seen her ovum cancer disappearing for more than 18 months.
The system has to change the immune cells from patients, change them into experiments so they can see the common protein of HER2 and then rediscover the cells.
J. Bajfsky, professor of the United States National Cancer Institute in Bethesiere, said: "Our results show that we have very positive vaccines."
HER2 has raised various cancers, including BER2, D praise, lungs, and coloqual cancer, as per Proface barfsky explains.
Out of the patients, the immune cells are targeted, and it has also worked to treat Liu as a "healing" for them.
Nye West L.L. Pro-Temp's debated at Pro-Temp, wearing a MAGA hat
It didn't look good.
Kseni West was recently put on a studio after a long-driven performance during the evening night, where he praised US President Donald Trump, who said he would continue his self-immolation in 2020.
After performing his third night song, Ghost Town, where he was wearing a Mexican Great Cap, he condemned the Democratic Republic and re-united his support for Trump.
"There are times when I talk to a white man, they say: "How can you choose Trump, he is racist!"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have come out of the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL Matt started the show with a skit, where the Hollywood star, Christine Blaji, took a joke at the Senate's Judicial Committee about the claim of sexual abuse by the Hollywood star.
Although it hasn't been broadcast, comedy actor Chris Rock uploaded the footage of the West on social media.
It is not clear if the rock post tries to mock the West, although.
Moreover, he complained to the West audience that he had to face difficulties in the backstage, too.
"They beat me in the backlands.
They said, 'Don't go outside the hat'
They're fucking me!
And then they say that I'm in a sinking place, according to the source of Washington Examiner.
West also says: "Are you going to see the place?" and says that he would read his own "Mr. Ket," because it means I can't tell you what you have to do.
Then try with love."
His comments, at least twice, were posted by audiences and members of the SNL Cast members were embarrassed, where one told the publication that: "The whole studio was silent."
Westers were brought forth as substitutes for Arrajana Grand , whose former lover had died a while before.
West I love it.
West conservative group TPUS has received support from the head of Conndes Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest souls is: thank you for standing up against the criminals."
However, Talksho host Karen Hunter tweeted that West "what he was, and he was extremely impressive."
"But I chose not to buy someone's music or his arts, which embrace and spread harmful standards for my community."
He's free.
And so did we," he added.
Before the show , he announced on Twitter that he had changed his name , and now "He is officially known to the West."
D is not the first artist who changed his name and DD, DD, who was known as Paof Daddy, Pofi and PDD.
Another of the contemporary Dunup was the Snoup Dog’s name Supup, and the late singer of the music , changed his name to a symbol known as Prince before .

The game of Thrones hit Kit Harington Toxic Masculin.
Kittington HBO's aggressive Middle Eastern Fantasy series is known for its strong role as Zone Snow.
However, the 31-year-old actor, Macho, spoke of the hero's style on the screen, giving little boys the impression that they should be severed to respect them.
While talking to Sunday Times Culture, Kit believed that something went wrong, and questioned how he could handle the problem in #MeoExClimate Age
Kitt, who was recently married to his game of Thrornas, Leslie, at the age of 31, admits that he felt forced on the problem.
"I feel personally, very strongly, right now - where are we misinformed?" he says.
'What were we taught men when we were growing up, who are facing this problem now?'
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the growth of the texic Masculini for its very male characters.
He adds: 'What are we born, and what are we learning?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that boys seem to have to follow this particular course if they have to be men?
I think this is really one of the biggest questions of the day - how will we change it?
For some of the youth there was a greater error .
In the interview, he also admitted that when the series comes into effect in the next summer, he won't do a game of Thrors Pical, he said he had finished the life of "wars and horses".

HIV / AIDS: China has released 14% growth in its new growth.
China has announced that 14% increase in number of HIV and AIDS victims.
There are more than 800,000 affected people in the country, health officers said.
Only about 40,000 new incidents were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases were sexually transmitted, which changed from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread quickly in various parts of China to perform an infection.
However, the number of people infected with HIV was almost zero, in a conference in Yunnan province, Chinese health officers said.
However, every year, there are more than 100,000 people, including HIV and AIDS in China.
HIV infection is a serious problem with the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still expected.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies suggest that 70-90% of men sex with men are later married to women.
This relationship with too many diseases comes from insufficient sexual protection.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to make universal access to HIV as part of its efforts to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the leaks of clients, 'disproportionate lies' and 'controversive theories'
On Saturday, U.S.A. Republican Maximin Waters denied that one of his staff members had posted personal information about US senators' personal data on Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democratic asserts that these claims are being circulated by scholars and websites.
"false, false, and more hateful lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The data includes the home address and phone number of U.S. senators, Senator Lindsay, and Mike Li and Orin Hach in South Carolina.
The information was published online on Thursday, when an unknown person posted a hearing at the Capital Hill hearing of the Senate panel on charges of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court candidate Brat Carvana.
The leak came shortly after the three Senators questioned Kevana.
conservative sites such as Gateway scholar and RedState have reported that the IP address of the post was linked to the office of "Werters" and published information from a member of the Waters staff, Hill reported.
“The false accusations are false and a perfect lie," the Waters continue.
"My staff members - who identify themselves as individuals, personal information and protection of fraud and false accusations - were settled in no way to expose this information.
This baseless charge is totally wrong and a perfect lie."
The story of Waters was quickly criticized by many online, including the former press secretary for the White House.
"This denial is angry," Flesh wrote.
"It says that he does not tend to be a member of the Congress."
Don't be angry when anyone is accused of what they have not done.
They must not be the defendants.
They should not question the motives of the complainer.
They must be quiet and fresh."
He was comparing the reactions of the Democratics about the judge Cavana's criticism of Waters, critics considered him very angry during the trial on Thursday.
Republican candidate Omar Navaro, who has been running the presidential elections in mid-election, also published his own opinion on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's big," he tweets.
In his statement, Waters said that his office warned "the authorities and the law enforcement agencies about these fraud claims."
"We will ensure that the criminals will be released," he continued, "and that any member of my staff and all members of my staff will be held accountable for their destructive and dangerous actions."
Johnny English Strauss reviews - the weak Roanoke Asterson spy.
It's traditional to see the brakes of any new photo, including British anchor, and it seems to have been approved by Johnny English Action-commend Freud Fresco, which started in 2003 and returned to life in 2011 by Johnny English Rebnborn.
Clearly, how many of the garbage are we going to use to make that self-immolation issue seem to have a new chance?
In any rate, pop-faced, rubber disabled Johnny English has a license for making new things the second time — more than anything else, it suggests that he created an extensive comic for the rest of the world without English.
He must have contributed to a note on the 2012 Olympic opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London, which, despite the absurdity of the smooth performance of the smoothness, was a dash of Mr. Bin's and a Dop's opening ceremony in London.
He mainly based on the traper, and the man of international secrets once playing Barakacard TV ads, spreading chaos.
This last one has one or two great moments at Jei outing.
I'd like to see Johnny English hanging around with a little helmet in the Middle Ages.
The gift for physical jokes shows, however, the joke is very low and inexpensive, especially at around 007 and "Syrian" film brands are now having fun with confidence.
The joke looks like it's focusing on children rather than adults, and I don't think Johnny English's weird accidents are as innovative and not as creative as the silent Asterson's joke.
The long-term foundation is that Great Britain is facing serious problems.
A cyber hacker broke into the network of British secret web networks, to expose the identity of all Britain agents in the field, to disappointed the responsible agent - Kevin Arnold.
This is the last hope of a Prime Minister who is already experiencing a complete crisis of politics: Emma Thompson, the semi-recessa character in this half-me, did nothing to do with the script.
His detectives told him that each active spy has been compromised, so he has to get out of his retirement.
And that means making Johnny English, who is now a school teacher in some back-class institutions, learns about how to cover it out: There are good jokes here, since English offers a rock-type school for spyers here.
Ben Miller is back at the English White Festival for Emergency and is reunited with his former long-long-term sidekirk Bauer.
Bao is a married man, married to a Underground commander, a jolly-hecstick role in the case of Vickin.
So the Batman and Robin returned to action to face Odrea Kurenenko's buffalo woman, Ofelfía Kotva, who was severely mistaken at the Ministry of Majeste's Secret Service.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Carsher Bavaria is dying dangerously in the hands of billions of dollars, claiming that he can solve the problems of Britain's computers: Jack lacsy sinful Jason Váña.
English and Buu started with the strangest words of their larger upper-class high-jinns: "They caught a flash in a French restaurant; they started shooting themselves in the luxury boat; and they tried to use the virtual expected headset to make themselves known inside the home of Sporta."
All stops must have been pulled for the last level, but as often as it is, it has a lot of children's TV views.
Very medium staff.
And I couldn't even think of anything like other Johnny English films: what role does the British film industry have to make as much as it really does for his talent?
Labor denies that it is planning to work four days a week in favor of Breton but will pay for five days.
Jeremy Jabin’s Labor Party will consider a key plan that the British will work for four days a week - but receive five days.
The group, according to the report, wants the institutions to share money from activists through artificial intelligence revolutions.
It will see the workers enjoying three days of vacation - but still the same pay.
Sources said the group's economic program will be "fate" and plans to move the country to support the workers.
Trade Union Congress approved to transfer a four-day shift as a way to change workers’ economic opportunities.
The Sunday Times, a senior source of Labor Party, told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but it is a 4-day workshop that fits the team's system to balance the overall industry in the economy.
Not the Labor Party’s first time in favor of this national idea, the Green Party promised four days of work during its general election campaign in 2017.
The desire is not currently supported by the Labor Party, though.
A spokesman for the Labor Party said: "A four-day workshop is not policy and it is not considered by the party."
John Macdnel, from the Shadow Chancellor, used the Labor Summit last week to express his views on a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDell says that he is determined to turn power away from "the anonymous directors" and "lovers".
The shadow Chanel's plan means that the current shareholders of water companies can not get their whole part back because the labor government can give some "experts" due to the misperceiving of the labor government.
He also confirmed plans to protect the staff of the organizations board and raise the ownership of the ownership, which is an annual amount of Rs.500 per cent, to justify the work of private companies.
Lindsay Graham, tell John Kennedy "60 minutes" that investigations can change the minds of the FBI in Kavana.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Brat Kavana has delayed at least one week of the final votes in the Supreme Court, and the Bureau's investigations have raised questions about whether Republican senators can turn their support around.
In an interview on Sunday, “60 minutes” correspondent Scott Pauli asked the Republican Senators, John Kennedy and Lindsay, if the FBI could discover something they could do to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague in South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I told you to go to the hearing, I told you, I spoke to Judge Kavana.
After that, I called him, the complaint came out, saying, 'Did you do it?'
He was determined, unsatisfied."
Graham's vote, of course, seems to be constant.
"My Bread was created about Kavana and it would require a great deal of serious charges to change it," he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett's strongly denied it," Stephen Blassy added Graham to Ford.
"And the man he called could not verify.
It's 36 years old.
I can't see new changes."
What is Global Citizen Festival, and did it make any difference in reducing poverty?
This Saturday will be the Global Citizen Festival in New York, an annual event that has a great line-up of stars and an equally impressive mission; the end of the world's poverty.
Now in the seventh year of its seventh year, Global Citizen Festival Jackson will only see thousands of people visiting the Great Lawn in Central Park to enjoy the activities like Conservatory Jackson, Conservative B and Sean Mendes, but not to raise awareness of the real purpose of the event to end the extreme poverty in 2030.
In 2012, Global Citizen Festival is an expanding global poverty project, a group that hopes to increase the number of people who are actively involved in the fights that promote poverty.
To get a free ticket for the event (if you are not willing to pay for the VIP ticket), concerters had to work with multiple jobs, like volunteers, e-mailing, calling, or helping them raise awareness about their goals in raising awareness about the purpose of ending a call to poverty.
But how much success did Global Citizen make for the next 12 years to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of being rewarded by concerts in which one is the real move to encourage people to take action, or is it another case of so-called "extremism" - where people think they are signing or sending a tweet online?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has said that it has recorded more than 19 million "work" from his supporters, moving towards achieveing goals.
It says that these measures have helped world leaders to declare the most equal promise and policy of 37 billion dollars that will affect the lives of 2.22 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 promises and announcements that started with its work, including at least 10 billion dollars already being distributed or raised.
The team's speculation that the protected funding has so far affected almost 649 million people across the world.
Some of the main promises are that the partnership of power-based investors, the UK-based investors, and the implementation of the "invigorate their full potential", promised to supply Randa to the County after receiving more than 4,700 tweets.
"With your help, with your help, the UK government, the donors, the national government, and the Global Citizen we can turn the social injustice into a footnote in history," the ambassador of the Power of Alliance in London during a power concert in April 20, 1818.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to the United States to improve breastfeeding of mothers and children, the government announced for a project, The Power of New medicine, which would reach 5 million women and children in an emergency intervention.
"What do you think we can end the extreme poverty?" answers a frequent question asked on its website.
Global Citizen responded: "This will be a long and hard way - we will never fall down and fail."
However, like our great civil rights and anti-racism movement, we will succeed because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardy B, Janel Money will perform this year's performance in New York, which will run by Debra-Li Fares and Herman.
U.S.A. can use the Navy to "responsib" the Navy to disrupt the US's fuel Rofony
Washington could take refuge in his Navy to prevent Russian fuels from coming to the Middle East, according to Washington's Foreign Secretary Ryan Jinc.
Zinq complains that Russia's arms in Syria - notably working on a legal government invitation - is an excuse to visit the new fuel market.
"I believe that their location in the Middle East is because they want to get power pimpsed like Eastern Europe, Europe’s southern center," he says.
And according to the officials, there is a way to take action for it and the means to take care of it.
"We have the US power to set free the sea with the Navy and block their fuel so that they don't go to the market."
Zinc was speaking to participants at the event organized by the Energy Alliance, a non-profit group known as the U.S. to call "The Coalition" in the United States.
He compared Russia and Iran to Washington's use of.
"We got cards," he said to Russia, including the fossil fuel-based economy, "independence from Iran and Russia's financial options is less fuel and added," he said.
These statements were made during a very cheap bid to European consumers in Europe to export natural gas.
The effects of the Trump administration, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to bar Germany from the 2nd pipeline stream project, according to Trump, in Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the US $111 billion stream doubles the capacity of the existing pipeline to transport 1,110 billion cubes to the cube, fully financial project.
The Kremlin's reasoning is that the project is not only because of Washington’s strong opposition, but because it is an unsatisfied competition.
"In my faith, we agree that it can't be used as a tool for fuel and that Russia's Energy Minister Alexander Novak, after an interview with the United States Energy Minister, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
Germany's position in the United States received negative reactions from Germany, confirming their commitment to the Germany Project.
In the industry, the German National Institute of German Industry (BDI) asked the United States to stay away from the European Union’s Energy Policy and the double-income agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
After the latest meeting between the German Chancellor, Angel Markel, and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the chief of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), we had a big problem with the intervention of any state in our third energy supply.
Elizabeth Warren, the candidate for the 2020 presidential position, said to the Senator of Massachusetts:
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he was "seemed" for the post after the transitional election.
Warren confirmed that he was in prison when he was in a town in Siyke, Massachusetts.
"The time came for women to travel to Washington and fix our broken government and establish women at the top," he says.
"After November 6th, I will be strongly involved in the presidential position."
Warren Town is the time when Presidentey Donald Trump expressed his opinion against "the country is on the wrong path."
"I am very worried about what Nedal Trump is doing about our democracy," he says.
Warren Trump and Trump's Supreme Court's criticism of the newly elected Bront Kavanagh.
In a Friday tweet, Warren said, "We need the FBI to investigate before voting."
According to a survey published on Thursday, most of Warren's own voters do not think he should fight in 2020.
The University's Political Research Center / Boston Globis survey said the Macedonia "invigorate" increase in the number of voters said that the senator should not fight in vote.
Thirty percent of the fight is supported by support.
The survey showed that support for former governor Deval Patrick is much higher than fighting for the vote, where 38% support possible battles and 48% did not.
Other of the most likely high profile protests in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Byden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
Assised Press reports, Baiden officially decides to decide between January.
Sara Palin quotes Palin's tracks in Trump's rally
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent two years in Iraq after two.
On Monday night, she was arrested and charged with domestic violence
"He tells viewers at a rally in Tulce, Oklahoma, "My own own son is going through the middle of which he's going through, I can understand the consequences of those other families who are going through with the PTSD and our army."
Palin called his arrest "a elephant" and told him about his sons and other combatants that "they came back with some change, they thought they were going back to think that the army and the military and other military members would respect their colleagues."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasila, Alaska, and according to Dan Benet, a police spokesman, who was charged with domestic violence, arms and drug addicts.
18 Ti State supports the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eightty states and District of Colombia are supporting the legal challenge of the new US policy that refused to provide protection for the victims of gang or family violence.
The NBC News reported that in support of the policy, representatives from the 18 provinces and districts, filed a Friday court - a friend - a court case in Washington.
The full name of Grace V. Sessions case, which the U.S. Civil Liberty Union filed against federal policies in August, was not published.
He said his band "and his violent gang, boys" was beaten by U.S. officials, but on July 20, his request for asylum was denied.
He was detained in Texas.
Attorneys in the state of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, have examples of the problems faced by large gangs and family violence in the United States.
The new U.S. asylum policy has backed up the decision of migrant appeals boards in 2014 to appeal for asylum to immigrants who fled to power for domestic violence.
In a Friday statement, Attorney General Carl Rein said that the new policy “has ignored the federal, federal and international laws of the decade.”
Friends - the Court Brife said that "all refugees should be judged according to specific information and circumstances and that the national ban violates the basic objectives of the ban."
In the statement, the attorneys also argued that the denial of entry to migrants is a sign of the U.S. economy, which is more likely to be an entrepreneur and that they are "neutral labors."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions was ordered by judges not to allow the victims of domestic violence and gang violence to flee.
"The nation, religion, nationality, or political opinion can be given asylum for those who have left their country due to oppression or fear of having to leave their country," Sessions announced its policy on June 11.
The solution to all problems is to say asylum - not even all serious problems - that people face every day in the world.
Death toll in double and desperate attempt to rescue the survivors
There was an even greater danger for survivors.
"The 35-year-old Rasa Kusuma, who was in the shelter center of Phopu, asked his children to comfort him with fevers."
"In an ambulance every minute, dead bodies are coming."
Clear water is not available."
Finding in the water that can be found and returned to their homes destroyed by residents.
Hundreds of people are suffering from injuries and 7.5 quakes.
Some injured people, including Dui Harrys, were kept outside Palu Army Hospital, due to strong aftermath.
She cried to the feelings of the earthquake when she spoke to her wife and daughter at the five-storey hotel room.
"No time to save your own.
I was trapped between broken walls, I think, "The press representative also told Harrys that they were in town for a wedding ceremony."
"I heard cries of my wife for help, then silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my kids.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "Glagali"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad advertisement in the U.S. Daily, China's U.S. Ambassador accused the US press of using "inciting propaganda" against Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump mentioned the Pedum, the largest Chinese daily in Iowa, and accused China of attempting to intervene in the US Congress election on Wednesday, November 6.
Trump is accused of attempting to intervene in the U.S. elections in Beijing, which U.S. officials told Reuters a new attempt to pressure China.
It is natural that the foreign government will provide ads to promote trade, but Beijing and Washington are currently in the business war which makes them more vulnerable to the importation of each other.
Chinese and American experts say that in the early part of the trade war, China's revenge customs were designed to harm the rest of the state, like Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trump.
China's U.S. Ambassador and former long-term governor of Iowa, Terri Branstade, a major agricultural company in China, said that Beijing has caused damage to American workers, farmers and businesses.
Bradenstade wrote in a post on Sunday's Day Mines registered that "China has now doubled the brutality with our own free press ads."
"The Chinese government is taking immoral advantage of American freedom of speech and free press through advertising advertising the Dos Mines registered to register."
"On the other hand, you can find limited opposition voices on the side of the Beijing street, and you can't see the real reflection of Chinese people's differences about Chinese economic road to China," he writes.
He added that his work "was denied a major newspaper print in China", although he did not mention the newspaper.
Before the Midday Controversy debate, Republicans want to keep women away from voters, analysts warned.
With multiple complaints from Republican sexual abuse, analysts have warned that during the upcoming midterm elections, they will receive a similar reaction from women, especially women.
The sentiment surrounding the issue has been extremely high and most Republicans are already trying to move forward with the vote.
In an article published on Saturday, Maxwell University's State Science Professor, Grant Rihar, told The Hill: "They can't come back."
Rihar says that the last minute after the FBI investigation, Senator Jeff Flec (R-A Arizona)'s pressure to calm down the angry voters.
According to Watan DC, senior advisor to the progressive Muovun community and National Women's Sponsman Jean-Pierre said Friday, "the women don't forget what happened yesterday - they are tomorrow and in November."
On Friday morning, the protesters chanted "November" during the demonstration at the Senate Hall in Kavana, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaji Ford.
“The non-participated political analyst Stu Rothsman told the news site, “the past of democratic origins and inspirations.”
"To tell him that there's already too much; it's true.
But it could be more, especially among the city dwellers, and among the 20-year-old voters who don't vote often because they don't like the president."
Even before Ford had publicly testified on the charge of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court's chosen candidate, analysts suggested that the Republicans would continue if they were to proceed.
"It has become a complex issue for the GOP," earlier this week, former chairman of the Republican National Committee Michael Steele told NBC News.
“It’s not just about whether or not it’s going to be the final vote of the committee, but also about how the Republicans have taken and used it,” Ezra’s U.S. Group, director of the Democratic Republic of Parliament, told the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be a little confused about who to believe in Fords and Kavanf's testimony.
In a new study, Ugov found that 41% of the respondents are sure or perhaps believe Ford's testimony, where 35% said they must either believe in Kavanf.
It also shows that at least 38% said that they thought Kavanf was perhaps or of course lying when he took his witness, and only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After being pressured by the Hudians, the FBI is currently investigating the case of Debora Ramirez, another accused of doing so by the FBI.
Ford last week, a sworn oath in front of the judiciary committee testified that Kavanf was a victim of drug addiction at the age of 17.
Ramirez complains that the Supreme Court showed him his own sexual organs during a party in Yele in the late 1980s.
Google and Facebook are planning to launch a new internet for the World Wide Web.
Tim Berners-Lee of the World Wide Web is launching a startup to challenge Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Interrupt, is a company that will build Solid on the open source platform of Berners-Lee.
Users of solidarity allow people to choose where they will be stored and what information they will have permission to access.
In an exclusive interview with the First Company, Barnes-Le joked that the Interrogation is "the real objective of the world."
"We have to do this right now," he says about startup.
"It's a historic moment."
Using this app, it allows everyone to create PD or D to create personal data store.
It may include contact lists, two-oodle lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like getting all the same browsers in the same browser as well.
The uniqueity of the personal online data store is that it depends on users - who can access information on the type of information.
The company called it "personal empowerment through doors."
According to the Directorate John Bruce, the idea of the Intervention will help bring wealth, processes, and appropriate skills to achieve unity.
The organization is currently composed of a team of Beers-Lie, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some agreemented developers and volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create tools for their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the website.
Barnes-Li says he and his team are not talking about a complete change in Facebook and Google's models of all their businesses are going to be completely changed overnight."
"We are not asking for permission from them."
In a post on the medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the Institution "is the commercial energy and a livelihood to protect the integrity and quality of new web based on solidism."
The World Wide Web Consortium was replaced by Berners-Le Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1942 with a radical change in the Internet.
In the past few months, the net has become a powerful voice in the debate by Berners-Le.
Even during the Interrogation, Berners-Lee World Wide Web Consortium, the web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute will be the founder and director of the Open Data Institute.
"I am impossible to hope for the coming era," Burces-Lie adds.
Van: Victoria Cross Cleric celebrates the first frequencies
Hundreds of years before the beginning of the city, the Church of England was the only priest of the Church of England who won Victoria Cross during World War I.
Lieutenant Colonel de Reverend V was won by Belenglish and Lehancott on September 19, 1931.
However, he was killed four days later by a assassin and never knew he had the highest honor of British military.
On Saturday, two of his grandsons exposed his monument at a parade in Northpamtonshare.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said that it was "an absolute significance" that the monument was revealed just 100 years later after his grandfather's funeral.
According to London Gejate, the Lieutenant Colonel Van "was led by a fire that led him to the Battleship by the fiercely injuring the field and machine guns" D-Qintin Cannon Parka.
He then rushed into the firing line and led the line along with the "top bravery" only with a field song and teared down three enemies.
Lieutenant Colonel Van van was killed by a German assassin on October 4, 1942 - just a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, says that his grandfather's work was "the things I could never do and what was most respected."
He and his brother, Dr. James vantager, placed a blossoming band led by Brentwood Imperial Youth band.
Michael Van said he was "supposing great respect for the part in the red," and said, "a real hero is being displayed in support of the people."
M.A.A.A.P. is awake all night to see 206 Repig, but instead they get Pipig.
Imagine that you woke up all night to see a wonderful afternoon 206 and the main event wasn't visible.
The main bill from San Jose had 13 fights with six key cards and channels were live on YouTube for 5 nights.
At 6am, as Gegard Mosssy and Rory McDonalds were preparing to face each other, the coverage shocked the audience in the UK when Pepa Peg changed.
In particular, they were awake at dawn for this fight, so some people were angry.
On Twitter, a admirer describes the changing cartoon as "a dirty joke."
According to the rules, they were forced to change children's cartoons at 6am, and in response to the question of the broadcast, senior co-vist Dave Schwarz from Beltto, in response to the question that the program was "not suitable for such an event, according to the rules.
"Pippa the Pig," yes."
The President of Bellatto, Scott Cocaor, said that the UK’s audience will be working on schedules for the future.
"We may be able to solve it during the concert" Cocaer said.
"But now there are six in the mornings and our Sundays, we can't do this until Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, there was a lot of messages when it was switched and they weren't very friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it might be some technical mistake.
But no, it was official.
I promise you this won't happen next time.
We'll lower it in five fights instead of six, just as we usually do - the opposite happened to try to give the fans too much.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island disks: Tom Deli suffered from "uninhumanity" because of sex.
Olympic Diver Tom Deli said that he suffered from acknowledgment of sex when he grew up - but it inspired him.
This 24-year-old says he doesn't go to secondary school until he realizes that "all are not like me."
When talking about the first Radio 4 Desert Island disc, Laurent said that he spoke about the "gay rights" of others.
He added that his concern about the Olympic win has been lost since the birth of a child.
The long-term program's regular host, Christi Young, took a few months off due to illness.
Being disfellowshipped at the first legion event, Delie said that she felt "little" than the rest of the world, because "the choice of children was not allowed to be socially acceptable."
He says: "To this day, it remains real to feel and to be different from what has given me the strength and determination to achieve success."
He said he wanted to prove himself to be "one thing" so that everyone would know about his sex and not be disappointed.
This high profile has become LGBT preachers in the two-time Olympic Olympics and has worked to apply for more countries to recognize homosexuality in Australia this year's Commonwealth Games.
He said he opened his mouth because he felt lucky to live in public without difficulty and wanted to give others "Hope".
This three-time champion talks about falling in love with a man - American film maker Dustin Lans black, who met him in 2013, "I was surprised."
Deli married the Oscar winner last year, who is more than 20 years older than he was, says that the difference between age was not a problem.
"When you were so young," he went to the Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone who had such a high level of life.
This couple gave birth to Robert Ray Black-Delley in June and Delie said that his "left point of view" had changed.
He said, "If you asked me last year, I'd say, "I have to win a gold medal." This was my meditation.
"Really, there are bigger things than Olympic gold.
Ravi is my Olympic medal."
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died when he was 2011.
Dely said his father never admitted that he was going to die and finally asked if their tickets were confirmed for London 2012 - because he wanted to be the first row.
"I never said you would stay in the first row," he said.
"When he stopped breathing, I took his hand and left his last breath and died and I didn't admit that he was not incompetent," he says.
The following year Deli took part in the 2012 Olympics and won the Bronzek.
He said, "This was the dream of my whole life - to celebrate the Olympics in front of my own audience, nothing better than that."
It also inspired the choice of his first song - Prawood of Hedar Bader - which was accompanied by the preparation of the Olympics and which still bites him.

Mykelson will sit on a bench on Saturday.
American Phil Michelson will build a record after playing his 47th Rider Cup on Sunday, but if you don't want it, you have to get back to his form if you don't want to.
Mikelson, who has been playing on this record 12 times in this two-day event, has been sitting on a bench on Saturday instead of Captain Jim Fuhrick.
Instead of being at the heart of Halal, which he used to play in the United States, the 5th major winner spent the day working as a cheerer and trying to ease his performance on the range.
The top of the driver's career isn't good enough for this 48-year-old Tite Le Golf National course, where long-term shots are often in trouble.
And if the course isn't bad enough for itself, it's Michaelson, with the 9th match, facing the British open-air champion Francesco Molinari, who paired Ruchi Tommy Flatwood, won four matches this week.
If the Americans, who are under four points at the beginning of the 12 singles match, can start well, prove to be important.
Furrik expressed confidence in him, even though he didn't have much to say.
"He's got to know his own heart today, with my shoulder and says he's ready for tomorrow," Fulic said.
"He has great confidence in himself.
He's the one of the Famar and the last time and this week he's given a lot to this team.
I didn't think he was gonna play two matches.
I was hoping more, but this happened and we were thinking about going ahead.
He wants to get down into the field like everybody else."
On Sunday's match, Mikelson Nick Faldoud will be the best of Rider Cup records.
It can end up in the Rider Cup careers which can't be sold through his personal record.
18 wins in the Pack of Mikelson, 20 losss, and seven shorts, even though Fulitik says his presence keeps the team alive.
"Oh, funny guy, smart, loving people, he's a great guy in the room," he says.
"I think the new players have enjoyed playing with him, as well this week, which you like to see.
He's more than just playing."
Europe Captain Thomas Schiffn knows that the biggest lead could disappear too.
Thomas সিorn, European Captain, knows from experience that a single day after Rider's cup of lead could be a little uncomfortable.
Dun's self-determination took place in Valerama in 1997, where the Sovi Balrates led the American team to receive five points from the Americans, but only in the narrowst margin there was a total of 1412,2172,27002.
"You can make yourself think that we had the biggest lead in Valerama; in Brooklyn we were the biggest lead, where we lost, and in Valrasama, where we won, but not only the difference," Says Drumn, a photo showing him on Friday and yesterday, two days from the 5th class of Le Martíni National.
History will show everyone and team that this isn't over yet.
Get off with all your enthusiasm tomorrow.
Get down on the field and do the right thing.
It's not over until we get the point on the board.
We have a goal, it's to try and win the trophies, and we'll have eyes on the birds.
I have always been saying that I look at the 12 players of my team, but we are very aware of who is on the other side - the best player in the world."
Morrn adds that I am happy to see our players doing their job in a difficult golf course, "I will never be too proud to believe in this.
Tomorrow is a different fight.
Tomorrow will come in front of your personal performance, and it's a different thing.
It's great to be with partners when all good things are done, but when you're alone on the ground, you're fully tested as a hideoffer.
This message needs to be reached all players, who must be the best tomorrow.
Now, you have to throw your partner away and bring the best."
On the opposite side, the opponent would have a look at Jim Fulic as a team that has personally played as a team, with Jordanian Spoiths and Justin Thomas, who brought up three points of four points.
As part of the winning team in Europe "The Miracles of Miracles" and Brooklyn, Fuuriri has also experienced dramatic Pot-change experiences as part of the final day.
"I remember every word I remember"
"We've got 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to get rid of the fast as Brooklyn and Madina.
When the game fell on one side, there was a lot of pressure on the side of the match.
We'll build lines and put the boys down as we think, in fact we're trying to do some magic tomorrow."
Paul KC, Justin Rose, Tommy Flatwood and Ian Pulter were charged with leading Thomas against the top order against Europeans, who will face Riri Mcllor in the opening match.
"I've managed to set up these groups, because I think it's going to cover everything," Solomon told him about the elections.
New German warship suspended again
Local media reported that the young German Navy was supposed to start with the newest team in 2014 to replace the previous cold war-time warship, but with the wrong system and snowballing system at least the next year.
Referring to the Military Spokesperson, Diee Zeit said the first of the Freegate's "Rainland-Faltz" was suspended to half the first half of the 269.
The ship was supposed to be connected to the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project is facing problems with the next delivery problem.
Four of the Navy's ships that were ordered by the Navy in 2002 will take place in the old city-responsibly-restraint.
It is said that they will have strong cannons, anti-aircrafts and anti-ships, as well as steel radars, redials and aggregators.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period - the new freegates will be possible for two years away from the port of the country.
In any case, the constant delay means that "it's great" warships, which are supposed to help Germany out abroad, will be old enough to enter into the water, Dye Jeit.
The unfortunate F.5 Freegate last year came under the title of last year, when the German Navy refused to launch the ship, sending back to the Blueam and Volos Shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time that a ship returned to the Navy after the Navy delivered.
Little is known about the reasons behind the return, but German media referred to several of the most important "stuffed" and hardware errors that would undermine the ship in the war.
The software features are especially important, because the bred-remmeburg-class naval ships will be led by the crew of about 120 sailors - half of the people free of old city-class Freegates.
In addition, it was also seen that the ship would be too heavy that would reduce its performance and prevent it from connecting the future of the Navy.
These 7,000 tons are believed to be twice as heavy as any of the German ships used by the same class during World War II.
Along with the broken hardware, the cost of the whole project, including crew training, is becoming a problem.
The initial level has reached $3.1 billion (US$3.6 billion) from 2 billion pounds (US$3.6 billion).
In recent view of the threat of a naval failure in Germany, the problems with the new freezers have become more important.
Earlier this year, the head of the German Parliament’s Defense Committee, Hans-Patter Bartels, admitted that "Mottan is running out of charge."
The official said that the problem was accompanied by time, because no ship that had been canceled was brought to the old ship.
She laments that no naval ship in Band-Bedmberg- class was able to join the Navy.
Hearing the control of national trust in bats is a secret life
New research is being conducted in a estate in the University of Scottish, to learn how to use landlimates to seek food.
Hopefully searchs will focus on the behavior of this unique flying animal and help in future conservation activities.
Scientists will continue researching for National Trust for Scotland, as well as the missing Dobton of the Inner Gardens of Wender Ross.
To track the activities of the superwives, special recorders will be placed around the area.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also run an ongoing survey using portable decree.
The sound of all recordings by experts will be assessed by batting and reporting on what a species is doing.
Then there will be a landscape map and reports to describe their behavior.
The NTS’ nature conservation counselor hopes the results will reveal that the most important fields of land are to be forgotten and how each species is used.
This information will help determine the usefulness of housing management, such as the creation of homes and the protection of fires and other species related to it.
The number of fires in Scotland and the UK has been low over the past century.
They are at risk for building and development work that will damage their sleepy places and homes.
The air-based turbines and light might be dangerous, such as some chemicals and buildings, as well as a danger to pet cats.
The bats aren't really blind.
However, their ears are more effective in hunting for hunting than their eyes at night.
They use a advanced echo strategy to identify the dangers and obstacles on flight roads.
The NTS, whose responsibility is to maintain the fires, focusing on more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks, and 676 hectares of land across the country.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct their studies, visit sleepy places, and sometimes rescue.
The organization has also set up the first and only place to preserve Scotland's remains in Damfifty and Glo’s ThreeVior estate, where eight out of the ten-dimensional species of Scotland are located.
The estate manager David Thompson says this estate is an ideal place for the firefighters.
"There's a good place for the 3vet bats," he says.
"There are old buildings here, there are many ancient trees and all the good places."
There is still much more unknown about bats, so we can understand what we need to do here and elsewhere."
He emphasized the importance of knowing the presence of properties before they are maintained because of the destruction of a mother-in-law’s residence that could destroy 400 and child fires, and wipe out the entire number of local bats.
It is illegal to protect the bats and kill them, harass them, or disturb or destroy their homes.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scotchish officer of the desert saving Trust, is a source of encouragement to the public.
He says: "We still have a lot to learn about the fires and we don't know how many species live."
Rolendo rejected the rape charge and lawyers continue to bring a case against the German newspaper.
The charges against him as "false news" that people want to "open" their names.
His lawyers are ready to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, who made the complaint public.
The Portugal and Juvents Forward accused them of rapeing an American woman named Catherine Majoroga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2004.
He was accused of giving him $5,000 to keep quiet on the incident.
A few hours after this claim came in public, his Instagram live video commented on his 33-year-old Ronindo's report on "false news" during a conversation with millions of fruiters.
"No, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," says Balon-Dio's winner camera.
" using my name, they want to expand their identity.
It's common.
They want to be famous for my name, but it's a livelihood.
I'm a happy guy and everything's going on." The player adds in a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronldo's lawyers are preparing to file a complaint against Der  bestowal, which they call "the unintended report in secret.
Lawyer Christian Shrewz said that the player "is responsible for the moral loss that is likely to be in serious violation of personal rights," and asked for compensation.
According to the story, the incident happened in Las Vegas, Las Vegas, and a casino suit.
The Nevada Clark County District Court has filed a report saying that Roald and Mayo player went to the home of a night club where he was physically raped.
Mayo claims that she later gave birth to her and told her that "9 percent of the "good people" were disappointed by "one percentage".
The document claims that Roald has confirmed that they had sex, but it has been agreed.
Mayotte also claimed that he was in the police and was taken to the hospital, but later he agreed to settle outside the court because he was afraid of "disgusting" and "instructive."
The woman, 43, says she is now trying to raise the issue because she is mentally upset because of the alleged incident.

Brastsit: You'll regret it all the time if you lose your position as a car maker
The UK "will regret it" after losing its first position in the world after breakout, Minister of Trade Gregor Clarke said.
He also said that it was "disgusting" that the UK told the BBC that if Britain releases the U.S., they will stop producing their produce in Barbieton near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark says.
The Japanese driver reported that people could leave their jobs due to a border delay at the break-down.
The Barton factory - which produces Toyota Orvenis and Avenis - produced nearly 1500,000 cars last year, was exported to the rest of the European Union.
Marvin Cook, managing director of Taunter in Barton, said, "My opinion is that if Britain comes out from the U.S. after March, the plant could be stopped."
Honda, BW, and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concern about leaving the European Union without any agreement on how to operate interborder trade.
For example, the BMW said they would shut down their mini plant in Oxford after a month of breakout.
The main concern is that the motorists are saying that the supply chain risks without agreements.
Toyota's production is based on "St-In-Time", the U.S. and both the U. and the U.E. have a significant share in per minute.
If the UK leaves the U.S. without any deal on March 29th, the border would be a delay in supplying portions of the supply and the crisis could lead to a trade palace.
The organization said that more than one day of the price of Inventary is not possible to keep production off.
Mr. Clarke says the Czech checks' plans for the future to have ties with the EU in the future have been "sorted properly to avoid such checks."
"We need a deal, we want to do the best deal that will not only survive success, but it will also be possible to enjoy future prosperity," he said at BBC Radio 4 today.
"Not only the Toyota, but also other manufacturers prove that the success of the supply chain is important."
Toyota is unable to say how long it will stop, but it has warned that the long term cost of factory competition will reduce the capacity of the competition and could lead to many jobs.
As the United Union of the Plan for 24 years working in Barton, and the U.S. Union of the Plan, Ahok Suvalaris, said that his members were deeply concerned: "A time of my experience, they will not come back to work.
One government spokesman said: "We need to have a specific and reliable plan for the future with Yu."
The White House says the meeting with Trump can be more delayed by Rosestein.
On Sunday, the White House reported that with Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rodney's high-level meeting with Rosenstein would be "a week behind".
Rosestein, Russia's intervention in the elections, the involvement between Trump's co-founders and the possible interruption of the President, Robert Mueller, has done his job to investigate the possible barriers of the president.
For the past few months, the scandal has been ongoing in Washington whether Trump will sack the Deputy Attorney General or not.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported on Rosenstein's use of secret mikes to record conversations with Trump, and the possibility of removing the president through 25th amendments.
Rosestein denies the report.
However, on Monday, he was reportedly on his way to the White House.
Instead of meeting Trump on Thursday, Trump was at the UN office in New York.
Trump says that he "do not like Rosenstein," but one of the women charged with sexual assaults against him, Dr. Christine Blezi, both received testimony, denied the meeting to the Senate Department of Justice to avoid the hearing.
Friday, Trump was ordered by the FBI for a week's investigation against Kamvanf, which was delayed by the entire Senate's vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Regarding the meeting with Rosestein, she says: "It's not the date, it could be this week, it could take another week for the Supreme Court's other current issues.
Let's show it and I want to share it with the media all the time."
Some journalists will oppose the statement, and no press meet on the White House after the 10th of September.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders says that not keeping the buffet because it wasn't about "showing" to journalists, even though he says: "I don't deny that they've done something about it."
He then suggested a direct connection between Trump and press.
"The current president is more than any president," he said without any explanation: "We have judged the number."
In the future, Brelfing, Sanders says, "If the news is given a direct question to the President of the United States, it's much better to talk to me."
We tried to do this and you've seen it for the past few weeks, and we've had a direct conversation with the President of the United States at press meet. "
Trump takes regular questions while leaving the White House or taking part in the opening session with prominent guests.
A single journalist conference is very low.
Perhaps this week in New York, the press showed why, to be self-determination and sometimes to see the weird presence of journalists in front of the team.
Health Minister N H. S. Scotland wrote the letter of U.S. staff's humble letter to the Breakdown.
The Minister of Health in Scotland, NSA, thanked the European Union staff and expressed their desire to stay in their brakes later.
Jean Freeman M.P., has sent a letter six months before the U.S. comes out of the EU.
The government of Scottish has already promised that Setild status applications will spend on the EU to work in the government services in the country.
In his letter, Freeman writes: There is a ongoing discussion between UK and EU about the breakout throughout the summer, which can be expected to end.
However, the UK government is also preparing for its impossible situation.
I know you're all going through a worrying time for this.
That's why I want to remind you again how precious their contribution to each member of the staff is to me without nationality.
The entire European Union and beyond it, colleagues have brought valuable experiences and skills that have strengthened and improved health care and benefited patients and our community.
Scotland is your country and we want you to stay here."

When foreign customers buy property in the UK, they need more stamps.
When foreign customers buy new property in the UK, they need to pay more and more money to help the homeless.
The move will ease the success of Corbin's campaign to attract young voters.
This stamp will apply to those who do not pay the UK.
Treasury hopes that income will be available to more than 120 million people per year to help the homeless.
When foreign customers buy property in the UK, they have to pay more — and with the help of the extra money the homeless will be announced today by Thresa May.
The move will destroy the success of the taxbean operation as a target for more secure housing and targeting high-income workers.
This stamp will apply to individuals and organizations who do not pay taxes to the UK, and the government's support with the support of the homeless.

About 13 per cent of new property in London, residents of the United Kingdom have been buying, price rise and making the situation more difficult for the first housing buyers.
Most of the country's elite regions - especially the capital - are becoming "known city" for foreign customers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy came weeks after Larris Johnson invited the younger generation to buy their first home.
He accused large construction organizations of increasing property prices without buying land and calling on Mrs. May to cancel the quotas of property in Britain to solve the “business problem.”
Mr. Corbin announced an interesting series of proposals for housing reform, including the end of rent control and "No-Talent".
He wants to give the Council more power to build new houses.
Mrs. May says: "The last year I said that I would sacrifice my prime ministership to restore British dreams - that should be a better life for every new generation.
And that means fixing broken houses.
Britain will always be open for those who want to work, work and build their lives.
However, it can't be resolved that foreigners and foreign organizations who don’t live in the UK will be able to buy wealth as easily as hard as the hardworking British residents.
Many people dream of ownership, and the problem of homeless ones remains very real.
Jack Ross: 'My final dream is to take charge of Scotland'
Sanderland Boss Jack Ross says that his "teacher desire" is to become Scotland's manager in the future.
The 42-year-old Scotland Nei, currently enjoying the challenge to restore the North-East club, now in third place, is behind three points from the first team.
Last summer, he was taken back to St.W.E. to the Scotsmanship, where he moved to the stadium of Light.
"I wanted to play as a player.
I got a B cap and so far, "Ras said to the BBC Sports Square in Scotland."
"But I grew up looking after Scotland's game with my dad when I was a child and it always brought me back."
If I succeed in managing the club, it can only be the chance."
There is Dykov, David Wess, Sam Eldis, Martin O’D’ol, Roy, Goos Potte and Paulo de Canio, amongst the residents of the Sandland Manager.
This former Alya Athic Boss said he did not feel disappointed by rejecting the established name of such a big club, located in Bernle and Espich Town.
"I'm going to be successful right now. Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?"
Because of the infrastructure and benefit of this club, it certainly deserves the Prime Minister League," he says.
"It's not easy to reach there, but I'll probably see myself as a success if I can bring the club back."
Ros's manager is about three years old after having been a assistant boss in Dumbton and a heart-ching staff for 15 months.
He then helped Alwa restore Alwa to the third level from the lower level and transform Saint Mirre into a champion from the lower end of the road.
And Ross says he's more comfortable than a game at Coke, Heartpool, Fawkark, St. Mirre, and Hamilton Academy.
He remembers Alwar taking responsibility, "this probably was a real milestone."
"I really believed that management is more suitable for me than sports.
It sounds strange because I've done it right, I've been living normally and enjoyed some success.
But it's hard.
You have to go through a lot of things every week.
I still feel the same way about the work pressure, but the management seems right.
I've always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it, it's the most pleasant thing in my own skin in my entire adult life."

The summer heat wave has increased the crowd in Britain’s shells, but the restaurants have put pressure on the chain.
In July and the sale of bars has increased by 2.7 percent, but statistics are estimated to have reduced by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of CGA's business counselor, who compiled the statistics, said: "The unexpected participation of the sun and England in the World Cup is going to last July, as well as the same trend as the sale of at least 2.8 percent in the past June, when the sale of the interest rate has declined and the sale of restaurants.
In June, the restaurants dropped at 1.8 percent of the business in the country.
Drinks are the main ones and the bars are very good, and the restaurants are the worst.
The food mains are also suffering from heat, but the restaurants don't sell them down.
It seems people are just going out for one drink.
It has increased 6.6 percent this month, selling food at three percent."
Responsibility and hospitality analyst R. S. Paul Newman said: "The latest trend of events continues.
The weather and major social or sports events are most likely to affect the market outside of the house.
It is not surprising that restaurants will remain in the tough conditions, but these 4.8% will be sad every year to sell.
"The long and hot summer season of food for the chief operators cannot come from bad times and will tell us if the soft weather in August will bring some relief."
In July, the new launch began and the total increase in restaurants was 2.7 percent, reflecting the decrease in sales in brand Rolls.

Each child has a secret social media account that they hide to their parents
The survey revealed that one of five children - some of them 11 years old - has secret social media accounts they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey by 200,000 secondary school students has been published on the "The Call Inta" page.

Alloyd Laura Scotty will be the "voys for Athic Board"
At the annual meeting of the Governmenting Body, Elidhodottts have been elected as executive director of the Scotchish Athletics Board.
Dufresne, one of Scotland's most successful trackers and Chairman Ian BT, described the move as a great opportunity for sports directors to benefit from his extensive experience during the last decade.

The internet is confused with the mother and cow compared to the milk pump
An breast pumping organization has divided the Internet's opinion with a advertisement to compare breastfeeding to breastfeeding.
“The first wordless practice in the world’s colour is the pancreation pump,” the consumer technology organization Elvi published a fun music video advertisement to show the freedom the new pump provides to modern mothers.
Four real mothers are dancing with a barn full of corn, including: "Yes, I am, but I don't have a tail" and "If no one sees them, they aren't an animal's bone."
Quorras goes on: "Prasp again and again, I'll feed children, get pumped up, I'm my girlfriend's milk wish."
However, the ad, which was released on the company's Facebook page, has sparked debate online.
The video received mixed reactions from the audience on the news of more than 76 views and Sowey Shay Sowe comments, and many say it shines with the milk industry's "wart".
"The use of beef in the commercial is very bad decision.
We also need to get pregnant and give birth to our baby, the difference that soon after birth their children are stolen from them," one wrote.
The LVIU is set up in a well - dressed nursing Brit (LV / Mother) pumped inside a well-known hospital.
Another comments: "It's really frustrating for mother and child Oov.
But why don't they use ads for moms who keep children close to them?"
Another said: "The most uncomfortable ad."
Others stood next to the ad, a woman admits that the song has become "exulty."
"I think it's a great idea.
If I was breastfeeding, I'd have one.
I think I'm just a cow when I get a pump.
The ad is a little crazy, but I've done it well.
It is an innovative product," wrote one.
Another comments: "This is a funny ad which is targeted by mothers who go to their workplaces and consider themselves "gru".
"This ad does not praise or criticize the deer arts."
At the end of the video, a group of women are informing them that they all danced at their bra.
The ad is based on the idea that many women feel like cattle while pumping them.
Although the LV pump is full of sound, he doesn't have tubes and fit into nursing buoys, which gave women walkers, babysponsories, and even freedom to leave.
Ana Balirin, mother's partner and E.D.D. said: "Elvi pump is a revolutionary product that should be brave and productive.
By drawing parallel images of women and milky cows, we want to highlight breast pumping and all of its challenges, an entertainment and related means of expressing the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will receive.
LV pump didn't take the first place in the news.

Hundreds of migrant children were taken to a tent camp in the Texas border
The number of detained children has increased, however, although the monthly border is relatively stable, it makes it even harder to keep the children in their sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors fear losing their own chances of being immigrants and children without documents.
The risk was raised in June when federal authorities announced that possible sponsors and other adult members of their family will be submitted to fingerprints, and information will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, a senior officer of migration and practice, Matthew Albanians, testified to the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who appealed to sponsoring orphans.
The agency later reported that 70 percent of those who got that Gitatah had no history of crime.
"Sponsor or sponsors are nearly 80 percent illegal in the country and a large portion of them are criminals.
So we continue to search them," said Star Albania.
In an attempt to rehabilitate children in society, officials have introduced new rules, including a month before being arrested, which was previously 60 days ago, told the shelters.
Many will be present via video conferences without personally coming to a court case for legal status to immigration judges.
Those who will be considered undeserved for relief will be expelled quickly.
According to shelter workers and according to reports from the system in recent months, children are likely to remain in custody as often as they are reported, with more anxiety or depression, so that they may attempt violent incidents or run away.
Supporters said that this concern is more intense in the big center like Torlow, where children are likely to be more concerned, more likely to be ignored, due to the size of their children.
They also said that instead of being mentally prepared or moving away to the center, many could be increased a few times so that they are already suffering.
The United States, French, and Turkish "occupiers" were asked to leave Syria immediately.
In address to the UN General Assembly, the Foreign Minister Walid-al-Melem urged Syrian refugees to return home, although eight years of fighting continues.
Mowalem, also the deputy minister of the country, said that foreign forces are illegally on the ground, and "we will take appropriate action."
"You have to go away immediately without them," he told the Council.
Mowalem emphasizes that "the war against terror is almost over", where more than 360 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have been forced to flee their homes.
He says Damascus will launch war until "the whole Syrian region is clean" against both terrorism and "illegal foreign presence."
There are nearly 2,000 US troops in Syria, both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs are mainly training and counseling against President Ali Bashar al-Assad.
This war has more than 1,000 troops in France.
In the question of refugees, Mowalem said that the situation is suitable for them to return and that he blames "inciting fear of some Western countries" which prompted refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and human organizations to help this return," he said.
"They're politics on the complete humanitarian crisis."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be given any restructuring support until the end of the political agreement between Assad and the opposition.
UN diplomats said that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to build a buffer zone in the last big rebels base in Idlib has led to political discussion.
The Russian-Russian agreement has prevented a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the region, where three million people live.
However, Mowalem emphasized that the deal has "the absolute time" and hoped that the military move would work against the Jihadists, including the al-Qaida-Gaida Front fighters, who would be "rooted."
United Nations Ambassador, staffan de Mistuira, has hoped to call for the first meeting of a new committee formed by the government and members of the opposition party to draft the next constitution and make its way through the elections.
Molem, on this committee, stated that the panel should limit the task of "consulting articles of the current constitution," and warned against undeterred intervention.
Why Trump will win the second round
In this argument, Trump will win the re-election of 2020, as many Liberals probably hope that his position will be over due to impeachment and scandal.
Which undoubtedly would end the most dramatic end of any president!
Until now, there is no sign of change in the audience's opinions.
From 2014 to CNN, the primary-time rating has doubled more than 1.5 million and has increased almost three million in the case of MSNBC.
The average TV audience of Fox News has grown almost 2.7 million from 1.7 million last year, and according to Neelsen, the "Bina Mado show" is at the top of a large audience of approximately 3.5 million viewers.
About the Secretary of State who became president after an attack, the ABC Drama said "it is a fire that attracts people because it doesn't understand us."
There is another theory by Colonel Skovell and "Just the Fanny Parties: Some of the hard truths hidden in Hollywood age club."
He remembers a taxi trip before the 2016 elections.
The driver asked him if he was voting for Mr. Trump.
He asks.
"He says, "because he talks funny." Miss Schove told me.
The chaos also has some entertainment value.

It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th vote will be raised, as two candidates, courtesy of the Congressional Distraction, are fighting for one seat.
Recently, in the old suburbs of Pittsburgh's Distraction, the Democratic Republic of Democracy, has fought Connor Lamb, who won a seat in a special election in Spring last spring.
Lamb is against Republican Kith Rothfas, currently representing the 12th District of Old Pennsylvania, much of which is part of the new 17th district.
In January, Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the old districts were constitutionally in favor of the Republicans, which led to a map of the map.
The main party in the new 17th District of the election struggle has been involved in the money-making competition between the Democratic Campaign for the Congressional Committee (NDCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
This post is part of our special coverage Venezuela Elections 2011. In March, Lamb Peb introduced his identity after his victory after he won a wide range of elections in the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
The seat had been in the hands of Republicans for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the 20th point in this district.

El Salvador is the Guinda master of support for the U.S. China, withdrawing later.
diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, a step back from Washington.
Mr. Trump made a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varella and he had a hotel in Panama on June 2222, but later removed the group's director of the Tramp Organization.
In a statement earlier this month, Foreign Department spokesman Hidar Naart said that officials decided to bring back American heads from El Salvador, Dominican Republic, and Panama from diplomatic missions.
However, the only punishment for El Salvador was the death penalty for those who received about $140 million as an American aid in the drug circle, development, and financial support sector in the 211s.
The proposed punishment included the layoff and specific visa restrictions, which could be painful for the Central American country due to its high unemployment and murder rate.
In addition to progressing in the internal meeting, North America and Central America officials held a high-level conference to protect and prevent immigrants from gathering in the U.S. over the past year.
But in mid-September, the administration's top officials made it clear that they wanted to do the conference, effectively leaving the possibility of the execution of El Salvador.
The diplomats said that vice president Mike Ponce would address the conference, which was scheduled for October, to issue a letter from the administration.
And the American angels in three countries quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without sending any new messages or punishment from Washington's side.
Mr. Bolton, a spokesman for the White House, refused to comment on the statement made by two American officials, including two diplomaticists, who agreed to discuss internal affairs.
Their statements confirm that an outside analyst is close to the administration and he has refused to publish them.

What should we do if Mr Trump was sacked by Deputy Attorney General Rodestein, who will determine the fate of Mr. Muller?

Later, he realized that "unless" Plusco-faxman was expelled by Miss Morris, who was an African-American, had hoped for a Filipino report from the New York Post.
Miss Maurice was given one day mines and then sent home.
Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation and is asking for three50 dollars a day for six months, although he was hired first without any agreement.
"I want to show them, look, it's not like this," he told the post on Friday, saying he added a more opportunistic application, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple accused Morris of being racist, saying that the expulsion of Maurice was justified in fearing that he could not be trusted after complaining against him.
"He didn't want to say what my wife sent me.
He's not a racist.
We're not a racist couple," husband Joel Plusko tells the post.
"But will you leave your children to someone who has treated you badly, even though it's wrong?
Your newborn son?
Tell me."
Plusko says about the charges of "separates", his wife only gave birth to a child two months ago, and was in the "most difficult situation".
"Will you go against someone like this?"
It's not good to do this," said the investment banker.
In light of the ongoing legal case, the public court was strongly condemned against the behavior and logic of the couple on social media.
Belton revealed fear that readers may not be able to communicate with the bear, published in a new letter.
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, who was born after the book was accepted, wrote about the letter: "It's hard to tell what it's gonna be like for the first time before expressing it.
It's so funny to know after the huge success of padding.
His father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write books from little toy bear, said that he was optimistic about his work, saying that he had "unsurpassed" the 60th anniversary of his death last year.
About Belton, whom he described as "a very important member of our family," said his father was very proud of his ultimate success.
"He was a quiet man, not a proud man," he said.
"But paddington was so real to him as if your own child had achieved some success: you're proud of him, though you don't have any comopolitans.
I think he saw the success of Belton a bit like this.
Although it was the harvest of his own creation and imagination, he always credited the padding.
My daughter was dead and I had to say goodbye to the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was rushed to hospital NSF, Luístur 2 where doctors tried to save her life.
"Don't call regularly to say it's bad, and maybe he won't live," Mrs. Ferran-Lishro said.
"The next time I got Nod's phone and found out he'd die in two minutes and I was forced to say goodbye to him on the phone.
And that's what I do.
I say, "Tashi, darling, I love you very much.
I'll come to you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medicine that doctors gave him to keep his heart off was slowly stopping him from working and going out of his body.
He died a while ago and then everything went off.
I had no choice but to wait and know everything.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was being brought up by my family and people.
I had to hold myself."
At last Mrs. Ifan-Lishrooz expressed his grief over her daughter's death, as well as other passengers of the plane, she was an unsustainable person for this difficult situation.
No one knows," he says.
'I was down, I was falling constantly on my eyes.
It's impossible to describe, but I'm sitting on a plane in the deny of Nod.
That he needs my love and sympathy.
I know how good he was in the base.
Sadly, the woman posted cards to stop suicide on the bridge.
Two women who lost their loved ones in suicides, worked to stop others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Hamfrish posted cards with an inspired message on the bridge and posted a phone number where people can call for help.
Ms. Davis's son, Tyler, suffered from cancer at age 13 and committed suicide at age 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I'm doing every day," he says.
Ms. Davis, 43, who lives in Leedne, says his son was a promising Chef and a big smile.
"They knew him for a smile.
Everybody said it was her way of making her smile shine."
Anyway, he quits his job before he dies because he had gone into the dark.
Tyler's brother, aged 11, found him dead.
Ms Davis says: "I continue to worry that this attempt will break."
Ms. Davis created cards, "Let everyone who has someone you can talk to, he could be a friend."
Don't sit quietly and talk.
Ms. Hamfrus, who has been Miss Davis's girlfriend for many years, has lost his 15-year-old partner Mark, after his mother died.
"He never said he was upset or something," he said.
"I noticed some changes in her behavior two days before Christmas.
"The day of Christmas was very bad - when the kids opened their gifts, they didn't go looking at them."
He said his death had a huge emotional shock to them, but it had to get over it: "It created a huge void in the family."
We were cut off.
But we have to fight his way."

Brett Kavanoff's future question about the beginning of the FBI investigation.
"I thought that if we could give anything that he wanted - because the time is limited, the chance is limited - we could probably bring some unity," Mr. Flesh said on Saturday, adding that the committee may be afraid to read, "it may be unfair" in the face of the injustice.
What was the reason Mr. Kavanoff and his Republican supporters didn't want the FBI investigation?
Their obligations are related to time.
The mid-election elections will only take five weeks to November 6th, if expected, Republicans will be making a bad result, their efforts will be very weak in the country's top court.
George W. Bush is calling senators and is making it public to support Mr. Kamvanoff, who was a personal secretary for Mr. Bush.
What happens when the FB report is submitted?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and49 Democratics are present.
Mr. Kavanf would still not be clear if he could get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would have broken the vice president Mike Pance tie and ensure him at the Supreme Court.
North Korea's defectors have been "atoned" under Kim's number.
Seven years ago, Kim Jong-un, a North Korean lawmaker, made this statement:
Park Byung-Seg, quoted South Korea's Merge Ministry, said that last year, the number of defectors was 1,127 - which was 2,706.
As Mr. Park said, the main reason is the heavy border control between North Korea and China and the importing of human smugglers.
Pyeongong has not made any public comment on the matter.
A large number of defectors from North Korea are accused of South Korea's citizenship.
Soul reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans crossed the illegal border since the Korean war ended in 1973.
Most of them escaped from China, who have the longest border with North Korea, and it's easier than crossing a highly protected zone between two Koreans.
China considers these refugees as refugees, not refugees, but illegal immigrants, and often force them back to their countries.
The relationship between North and South Korea, which is still in the war, has been remarkable in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of both countries held a meeting for discussion at Pyongyang, which was centered on the discussion of nuclear impeachment of Thim.
It came after a historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jung-un in Singapore, when they were fairly agreed to build the nuclear weapons-free Korean colony.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young-ho blames the US ban on progress on Saturday.
In a speech given at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Mr. R. says, "If there is no trust in the United States, we will have no confidence in national protection, and we will not be the first to destabilize ourselves in such situations."
Nancy Bront told Kavana that she was unconfirmed by the Supreme Court.
House minority leader Nancy Pyesi called the Supreme Court Nominit Kavantof "hit-alter" and said he was inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
At the Texas Tribune Festival in Texas on Saturday, Tsai commented in an interview.
P. P. Tsy told the Kavanif's response on Thursday about his testimony in front of the Senate Judicari Committee, "I can't imagine that if any woman ever did anything like this, she would be called "Histy-fed".
Kavanf strongly refused to complain, saying he had sexized Dr. Christine Blange when both of them were teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanf was passionate about the lives of his family and high school.
He clearly condemned the Democratic Party and accused the charges against him of being a "dover and analytic character" of Libarals, accusing him of being a "constitutional figure" in the 20th presidential election of Hilary Clinton.
Pilsy said he believed that Kavanf's testimony proves that he is not worthy of the Supreme Court, because it proved to be unfair against the Democratics.
"I think that he made his statement, and the way Clinton and the democrats were banned," he says.
When asked if Kavanf would impeach him if he received majority in the House if the Democratics found it.
"I'm going to say that if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or FB, he's not the only Supreme Court who deserves it, but also the one he's in court," P.C. said.
Kavanoff is currently the judge of the circuit staff of the D.C.
Neilsy adds that as a Democratic, he is worried that Kavanf will oppose the Fordicative Care Act or Ro. Od, because he himself is a livative justice.
In his confirming hearing, Kavanoff avoided the question of whether he would change some of the Supreme Court decisions.
"It can't be that Histaria-smed, fair-minded people go to court and tell us, "It's not great, it's great," Tssi said.
And women should control it.
It's a fair debate, months and years of anger are coming out, and she can't cry.
Ms. Steem told me after 435 years of "we are angry."
"I don't think it's rare, what do you say?"
"A woman who said she was crying when she was angry, but she decided to talk to him when she was angry, "You might feel sorry, because I'm crying."
I'm really angry."
Then he would continue.
I thought it was amazing."
Tears usually serve as an expression of anger because they are victims of misunderstandings.
A sharp memory of my first job, in a male-dominant office, where I once saw myself crying out, an old woman holding my skater - I was always afraid of him who pulled me down the stairs.
"Don't ever let them see you crying," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sorry and they'll be happy to see."
Patrick Shardar, the Democratic Congressman in Colorado, worked with him during the presidential election of Gary Heart.
When Mr. Heart was caught on the monkey business boat abroad about marriage, and went out of touch for dirty acts, I am deeply disappointed that Ms. Shawder doesn't have a reason to be his president.
"It wasn't very well-known," he said laughing after 30 years.
"There are seven other candidates in the race, and none wanted.
One of them called it "Sno White and Seven Dwarves."
As he was delayed at the beginning of the campaign, he was behind the fund collection, so Aung San Suu Kyi told Aung San Suu Kyi that he would not run without collecting $2 million.
It was a loss war.
He saw that a supporter was given just $1,000 if a man was given $10,000.
"Do they think I'll make a difference?" she wonders.
When he announced that he was not making official preaching, he was deeply grateful for his passion and his supporters, hard to collect money from the system, which he targeted voters, and became ill with anger about gender discrimination.
"You could have felt that I had a nervousity," says Ms. Shardar.
"You could have thought that Clinic was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, where would they bury me?
"He cried"?
How can this trade war in the US-China side with Beijing?
The first episode of the United States-China trade war was exciting, and when the war ended, Beijing could benefit from the long term of conflict between the two countries.
U.S. President Donald Trump was first warned by the tax tax on major Chinese products including solar panels, steel and aluminum earlier this year.
The most notable answer was this week, when about half of the total imports from China, which are set up by $200 billion ($150 billion), new regulations.
Beijing took revenge every time – most recently they raised five to ten percent of the US $60 billion.
China has decided to fight with its eyes and the world's second largest economy has no chance of bringing its eyes down soon.
Backing the money to stop Washington, but openly bowing your heads to the US will be an insult to China's President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing can play cards properly, the pressure of the US trade war can help China in a positive way between two economys.
"The situation can be much more dangerous in both countries as a result of any fast political decisions in Weshington or Beijing," Think Tank, a researcher at the Center for New American Security, says Abigail Grace, who practices Asia.
Syria called for its return to refugees, said the Foreign Minister.
Syria says that the refugees are ready to return, and they have requested to rebuild the country which has been hit by a seven-year war-torn war.
While speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Melem said the situation is improving in the country.
"The progress in fighting terrorism is stable and secure today," he says.
The government continues rehabilitating to restore normal conditions in areas destroyed by terrorists.
The situation is favorable to all those who are forced to leave the country because of their daily lives and livelihood due to terrorism and the constant economic crisis.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
The remaining 6 million people in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mwalem says the Syrian government welcomed all the support to rebuild the country.
However, he also insisted that there will be no coercion or assistance for the rebels.

I'm so happy I got the cup back.
It's the success of the team, I've been able to help," said García in the European victory.
He holds the responsibility for the President of his country, who lost the U.S. Lizard Golf Tiger Woods on Sunday, 2 and 1 a.m.
"I am very proud to have lost the Woods, who grew up to see him," said the 23-year-old Ramam.
Woods lost four of his matches in France, he had a record of 13-2-3.
It is Bemanan statistics for one of the greatest players ever, who only won 14 heads after Jack Niklas.
Team U.S.A. has been stumbling over the whole weekend, apart from Patrick Rid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finnu.

We had some kind of pressure on Europe this morning.
We couldn't.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a good captain.
His 12 players played very well.
"We'll turn around, I'll be working with the USPG and Rider Cup Committee.
