Cumulative outbreak of the rapidly spreading coronavirus (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK, January 1 to March 15, 2020
The increasing prevalence of coronavirus cases (COVID-19) shows a similar trend in EU/EEA countries, and the UK confirms that while in different countries, we are at a different stage of the pandemic, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
Based on Italy’s experience, other countries, hospitals, and intensive care sectors should increase their readiness to increase the number of COVID-19 patients in need of health care and intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a group of pneumonia cases of unknown cause were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the cause as a new coronavirus variant called acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been referred to as the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date shows that about 80 percent of people with COVID-19 have mild illness, i.e., a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and most of these recover.
In about 14 percent of cases, COVID-19 develops into a more severe disease requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6 percent experience a critical state requiring intensive care.
The death rate in hospitals due to COVID-19 is around 4%.
In this study, we assessed the trend of the increasing spread of coronavirus in each of the EU/EEA countries and the UK (UK) and compared them to Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with the number in Italy from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK
After China, COVID-19 spread more geographically, and the dynamics of the pandemic in other parts of the world are now following the country.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
Spiteri and colleagues in the journal Eurosurveillance reported the first confirmed COVID-19 cases in Europe on March 5, 2020, according to the World Health Organization definition.
In the EU/EEA, three cases confirmed by France on 24 January 2020 were reported from people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On March 15, 2020, cases of COVID-19 were identified in all 30 European/EEA countries and the UK, with 39,768 confirmed cases and 1,727 deaths reported from December 31, 2019, with 17,750 confirmed cases and 1,441 deaths reported from Italy alone.
Gaining the cumulative number and cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), COVID-19 cases in different countries around the world come from only official sources, such as the Ministry of Health, the National and Regional Health Organization and the World Health Organization, which are updated every day at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to assess the trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with the trends of disease in Italy.
As an indicator of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 cases over a 14-day period, and as a result the normal course of COVID-19 was considered in EU/EEA countries and the UK during the period January 1 to March 15, 2020.
The cumulative number of cases declared by each country on March 15, 2020 at 8:00 a.m. was also compared with cases declared by Italy from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The 14-day cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally follows Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
Overall, for the EU/EEA and the UK, the cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 began to rise around February 21 and then increased sharply around February 28, 2020.
This is mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but other EU/EEA and UK countries have shown a similar increase in the cumulative prevalence of COVID-19.
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to cases in Italy for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
The figure shows that on March 15 at 8 a.m., the total number of cases reported in 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK is comparable to the number of cases in Italy in the previous three weeks or less.
Our results suggest that the number of cases diagnosed with COVID-19 is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Trends observed in the cumulative COVID-19 outbreak indicate that the pandemic is currently progressing at nearly the same pace in all countries.
While countries are at different stages of the disease, the responses of public health organizations vary, and there are likely different definitions and protocols in countries to select patients who need to be tested for COVID-19, including an increase in the speed of testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in areas affected by the virus in Italy described a situation in which about 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care, and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas had reached their maximum capacity.
Information on the admission of COVID-19 cases to hospitals or intensive care units is currently available at the EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% cases, respectively (data not shown).
In order to supplement current regulatory data that focuses on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths, this information must be collected in a systematic way.
A study conducted during 2010-11 found that access to intensive care beds varies greatly in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds for every 100,000 people in Germany to 4.2 beds for every 100,000 people in Portugal.
That is, countries may have fewer or more resources than Italy (12.5 beds of intensive care and intermediate care per 100,000 population in 2010-11).
Health care capacity saturation modeling scenarios, with estimates for different EU/EEA countries and the UK on the prevalence of COVID-19 cases hospitalized in connection with the occupation of more than 90% of the capacity of intensive care beds, are presented in the sixth ECDC COVID-19 Rapid Risk Assessment Update.
Because cases are categorized in certain regions of the European/EEA and UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve the population of an area, information about cases and intensive care beds should preferably be available on the Territorial Units List for Statistical Level 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy’s experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, hospitals and intensive care units should prepare themselves for a sustained SARS-CoV-2 transmission scenario and an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients who need special care, such as those in affected areas of Italy.
As noted in the recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, a rapid, preventive, and inclusive approach is needed to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, with a rapid shift from containment to mitigation approach, as predicting a rapid increase in the number of cases if not done too early may cause decision-making authorities and hospitals to not have time to understand, accept, and adapt their response based on this process.
A rapid risk assessment lists public health measures to reduce the impact of the pandemic.
A short opportunity for the remaining countries to increase their control measures to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on the health care sector.
Failure to do so will likely put the health care system of other EU/EEA countries on the brink of a wave of patients who will need intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) caused by acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) has killed more than 3,000 people and infected 80,000 in China and other parts of the world, a disaster for humanity.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus, similar to the SARS virus that infected thousands of people in 2003, may have been transmitted from bats and caused similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 is less severe and less deadly than SARS, but it is more transmissible and affects older people more than younger people and men more than women.
In response to a large number of articles published about this emerging disease, this paper attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the rapidly expanding research topic.
We will cover the basics about epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of this disease.
Although many questions still need answers, we hope that this review article will help understand and eradicate this deadly disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unforgettable memory for all Chinese who have been forced to stay at home for all the holidays and several weeks after due to a new viral outbreak.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; as a result, the virus was named SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the associated disease was named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and around 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 had been reported, of which more than 40,000 patients had been discharged and more than 3,000 patients had died.
The World Health Organization has warned that COVID-19 is “the number one enemy of the people” and potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), since the first report on January 7, 2020 in less than two months, more than 200 articles on COVID-19 have been published, including virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, which have identified the sequence of the virus that is isolated from the body of several patients.
In this review, we try to summarize the progress of research in this new and rapidly developing topic area.
If possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other infectious diseases caused by CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, which emerged in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about preventing and treating this disease, as well as some other essential questions.
CoVs have traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens for humans, leading mainly to about 15 percent of common colds.
But in this century, we have encountered two highly pathogenic human CoVs, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused outbreaks in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and spread to many other countries soon after, with terrible outbreaks and deaths.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of CoV in the recorded history of mankind.
As shown in Figure 1.1, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown origin were first reported from Wuhan to the Chinese National Health Commission on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first death was reported from Wuhan.
At the same time, the epidemic quickly spread to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, the health care department reported an infection and showed that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On January 23, residents of the city of Wuhan were quarantined in their homes, and public transport was halted.
On January 24, the first clinical study of the disease reported that out of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was considered to be the site of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
By the time the report is published, the disease has spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).
Since the situation is evolving rapidly, the ultimate extent and severity of the outbreak remains a matter to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, showed a more up-to-date picture of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
People with SARS-CoV-2 are of different ages, but mainly between 30 and 65 years old.
Nearly half of the infected (47.7%) were over the age of 50, very few were under 20, and only 14 were under the age of 10.
People with SARS-CoV-2 are more male (0.31/100,000) than female (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 spread in various clusters mainly in and around Hubei.
The period from the start to the diagnosis of COVID-19 was an average of 5 days (2 to 9 days).
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0 to 7.2 days).
The period from beginning to death was an average of 9.5 days (4.8 to 13 days).
The base slope number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the set R0 was 2.23 to 4.82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, corresponding to the busy time of transportation before the Spring Festival in China.
The death rate of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate of all patients was 3.06 percent (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (over 60) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large, enveloped viruses that contain a single strand of sensory RNA.
These viruses can be divided into four classes: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, which have been shown to spread to humans.
Glycoprotein (S) binds to the host cell angiotensin and converts enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidylpeptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The virus' RNA genome is released in cytoplasm; after the virus's genome is replicated, genomic RNA with enveloped glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins forms sacs containing virions that then bind to the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
With genetic adaptation of more than 99.98 percent of 10 sequence samples collected from the main site of the outbreak, the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, it was found that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through an examination of the electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the ultra-thin lining of the human airway.
Human ACE2 was found to act as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein binds to human ACE2 from SARS-CoV-2 weaker than SARS-CoV, which corresponds to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secret protein encoded by orf8.
Orf3b in SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in the pathogenicity of the virus to prevent the incidence of IFN<0xCE><0xB2>. However, orf8 has no known functional domain or cause.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou et al. reported the Cryo EM structure of full-length human ACE2 with a resolution of 2.9 angstrom in combination with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They found that the compound, which had open and closed forms, was combined as a dimer, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 compound could bind two S proteins, which could be evidence for CoV detection and infection.
B0AT1 can become a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and Middle Host
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have both been found to originate from bats and have been transmitted to humans through the Sioux and Camel cats, respectively.
By comparing phylogenetically SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats are found to be native hosts of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like CoVs, originating from the SL-CoVZX45 bat and the SL-CoVZX21 bat.
However, the question of what intermediate host has helped the virus cross species barriers to infect humans remains unanswered, and the path of transmission still needs more clarification.
Jay et al. believe that snakes, which contain a homogeneous compound within the protein S, have acted as carriers of the virus from bats to humans.
According to a study, researchers at Guangzhou, China, based on a 99 percent genetic homology of CoVs discovered in Pangolin and SARS-CoV-2, said that perhaps eating pangolin - a type of ants eater with a long trunk that is often used in traditional Chinese medicine - has served as a potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference that has spread across the two genomes is still a big difference, so we are still waiting for conclusive results for solid evidence (Figure 33).
The physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV survive for up to 48 hours in a dry environment at 20<0xC2><0xB0>C and 40 to 50 percent to 5 days in laboratory conditions.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet rays and temperatures of 56 <0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes, ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, prastic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents other than chlorhexidine, and these can effectively inactivate the virus.
The human population as a whole is not immune to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new virus.
There is currently no detailed study on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
In this way, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
In general, after the virus invades the host cell, the virus is initially recognized by the host’s innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including C-like lectin receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs).
The virus causes the emergence of inflammatory factors through various pathways, maturation of dendritic cells, and interferon-type synthesis (IFNs), which limit the spread of the virus and speed up the macrophages of phagocytoses in the antigens of the virus.
However, the N protein in SARS-CoV can help the virus escape from the immune system.
The adaptive immune system soon joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill the virus-infected cells.
T-helper cells produce pre-inflammatory cytokines to help defend cells.
However, CoV can inhibit the function of T cells by inducing apoptosis of T cells.
Humoral immunity including supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies are also essential in the fight against viral infection.
For example, the antibody isolated from the recovered patient will neutralize MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system causes a large number of free radicals to be produced locally, which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst-case scenario, lead to multiple organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2, characterized by cluster appearance, mostly affects elderly people with underlying diseases and pregnant women.
The common thread is that people who are exposed to large amounts of the virus or have poor immune function are more likely to be infected than others.
Based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan, the average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 was 1-14 days, but in most cases lasts 3 to 7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases shows that the incubation period is an average of 3 days and ranges from zero to 24 days.
A newer study shows that, as described above, the incubation period is 4.8 days (3.0 to 7.2 days), based on a total of 8,866 cases.
This is very important for health authorities to be able to determine effective quarantine times based on the most accurate incubation period, thus preventing the virus from spreading from infected people who do not have symptoms to others.
A common practice is that people exposed to the virus or infected with the virus should usually be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the primary and primary symptom of COVID-19, which can be asymptomatic or accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, runny nose, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced shortness of breath or reduced oxygen in the tissues a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the disease progresses rapidly to develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidification, and blood clotting disorder.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and severe fever, even without pulmonary abnormalities in radiological images, should be screened for early detection of the virus.
A population study in late December 2019 showed the percentage of symptoms as follows: 98% fever, 76% dry cough, 55% shortness of breath and 3% diarrhea; 8% of patients needed a ventilator.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family cluster and a cluster caused by transmission from an asymptomatic person.
A 2012 population study found that patients with MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of them required a ventilator, which is much higher than COVID-19 patients, indicating that MERS is more lethal than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99 to 100 percent), dry cough (29 to 75 percent), shortness of breath (40 to 42 percent), diarrhea (20 to 25 percent), and sore throat (13 to 25 percent) were shown to be the main symptoms, and about 20 to 14 percent of patients needed a ventilator.
By 14 February, when the number of confirmed cases globally reached 66,576, the percentage of COVID-19 deaths was about 2%.
By comparison, the death rate of SARS as of November 2002 was about 10 percent of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
According to a population study in June 2012, the percentage of deaths for MERS was calculated as 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
One previous study suggests that the R0 for SARS-CoV-2 reaches 6.47, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71 to 7.23, while the R0 for SARS-CoV ranges from only 2 to 4.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality rates, and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above images show that SARS-CoV-2 is more potent than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of prevalence, but SARS-CoV-2 is less lethal than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is much more difficult to control than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The start of a cluster often occurs in a family or from a gathering place or vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or stay in Wuhan or other infected areas or contact with infected people or patients two weeks before the onset of the disease.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus for more than two weeks without symptoms, and recovered and discharged patients can re-transmit the virus, which is a warning to increase quarantine time.
In the early stages of the disease, the number of white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in patients is normal or low.
For example, lymphophenia with a white blood cell count of less than 4<0xC3><0x97>109/L, including lymphocyte counts of less than 1<0xC3><0x97>109/L, and aminotransferase aspartate levels increased and the virus was present in the blood in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood of some patients increased, and the C-reactive protein and red blood cell sedimentation in the blood of most patients were increased.
In patients with severe cases, dimer levels of D, which is the result of fibrin degradation in the blood, increased and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
Visible abnormalities in chest radiographic images are found in most COVID-19 patients and are characterized by double-sided shadows or opaque glass opacity in the lungs.
In most patients, abnormal pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops.
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and advanced fibrosis severely compromise a person’s air exchange.
Type I and II dysfunction in pneumocytes reduces surfactant levels and increases surface tension, resulting in reduced lungs ability to expand and increased risk of lung failure.
So the worse the findings of chest radiography, the greater the extent of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed the scaling of pneumocytes, the formation of glass membranes and the penetration of interstitial lymphocytes and multinuclear syncytial cells in the lungs of the disease that has died of the disease is consistent with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS and is similar to those of SARS and MERS patients.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2-related RNA via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main criteria for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false-negative rate of this method, which may accelerate the epidemic, on February 13, 2020, the use of clinical symptoms (which no longer rely solely on RT-PCR) to diagnose the disease began in China.
A similar situation occurred for the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is essential for an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, Feng Zhang Group proposed a protocol using CRISPR-based Sherlock methods to identify SARS-CoV-2, which would detect synthetic RNA fragments related to SARS-CoV-2 at 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L to 200 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L (10 to 100 copies per microliter of input items) at a cost of less than one hour.
It is hoped that the new method, if approved in clinical samples, can dramatically increase the accuracy and convenience of testing.
Due to the lack of experience with this new CoV, doctors can mainly provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while various treatments used to improve other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases have been suggested (Table 2).
These treatments include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressive drugs, steroids, plasma from improved patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from improved patients was suggested for use in treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing to produce antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs in the beginning and is likely to have weaker attacks on other organs that have ACE2, such as the digestive system and kidneys.
However, dysfunction and respiratory failure are the most important risk in lurking patients and the main cause of death.
Thus, respiratory support is vital to alleviating symptoms and saving a person’s life, which can include general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilator and invasive mechanical ventilator, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infection and septic shock, and protecting vital organ function in patients with SARS-CoV-2 is also essential.
Cytokine storms have been shown to result from an overreaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
Cytokine storm is a systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3> and MCP-1.
This cytokine induces immune cells to release large numbers of free radicals, which is the main cause of ARDS and multi-organ failure.
Immune suppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in patients with a serious condition.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storms.
Other therapies for immune suppression in order to prevent cytokine storm include modulating the immune response driven by T cells; blockage of IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1 and TNF; inhibition of JAK; blinatombe; suppressor of sending cytokine 4 symptoms and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids were widely used as immunosuppressive drugs in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, the use of steroids in high doses in case of severe lung damage was not helpful in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, it may cause severe side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, and significantly affect the recovery of the disease.
However, short courses of corticosteroid use in low to moderate doses have been recommended to be used with caution for patients with COVID-19 who are in critical condition.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral treatment has been approved for this disease.
However, it has been found that intravenous intervention with remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, has been effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead initially to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
The possible inhibition of other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS, was later demonstrated by remdesivir.
Accordingly, Gilead has sent the compound to China to conduct a series of tests in people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results were very promising.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential treatment for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other adverse reactions can occur after combined treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir.
Interaction with other medications used in patients should be closely monitored.
Plasma ingestion from improved patients and antibody production
Receiving blood from patients who have recovered from a contagious disease to help treat other patients who suffer from the same disease or to protect healthy people from developing the disease has a long history.
In fact, patients who have recovered often have relatively large antibodies in their blood to fight the pathogen.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects, detecting unique molecules in pathogens and neutralizing them directly.
Accordingly, plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 sick patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, which was associated with reduced inflammation and viral load and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, before certain therapies can be offered, the large-scale application of this method needs to be confirmed and clarified.
In addition, due to the therapeutic effects, some plasma-related disadvantages should be considered carefully.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially a life-threatening toxin.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low and the demand for plasma for the treatment of patients is high.
It is difficult to quickly produce specific antibodies that are sufficient to fight the global epidemic.
Therefore, isolating B cells from improved patients and identifying genetic codes that encode antibodies or sieve antibodies that are effective against the virus’s main proteins is more important.
In this way, we can rapidly increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects are largely dependent on the composition of different components in the formula, which vary depending on the diagnosis based on TCM theories.
Most of its effective components are still unknown or obscure, as it is difficult to extract and verify these components or their optimal composition.
Currently, TCM has become one of the most important therapies for patients with mild symptoms or patients with moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from difficult stages due to a lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The highest rate of treatment was observed in COVID-19 patients in several provinces in China, where 87% of the patients used TCM, including Gansu (63.7 percent), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%). In Hubei province, where only 30% of COVID-19 patients used TCM, the lowest rate of treatment (13%) was observed.
However, this comparison is not entirely correct, as many factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should be taken into account.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing Western therapy (WM) alone and WM and TCM combined therapy.
They found that the time needed to restore body temperature, disappearance of symptoms, and hospitalization in the group treated with WM+TCM was significantly shorter than in the group treated with WM only.
Surprisingly, the rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was lower in the WM+TCM group (7.4% vs. 46.2%) and the mortality rate in the WM+TCM group was lower (8.8% vs. 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of TCM is still waiting for better controlled trials at larger scales and more centers.
Determining the mechanism of action and determining the effective components of the TCM treatment or their combinations, if possible, is also a matter of curiosity.
Suspected patients or confirmed COVID-19 patients often have a great deal of fear of this highly contagious and even fatal disease, and quarantined people also experience boredom, loneliness, and anger.
In addition, symptoms of this infection such as fever, hypoxia (a lack of oxygen in body tissues), coughing, and side effects of treatment such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to more mental distress and anxiety.
In the first stage of the SARS outbreak, a variety of psychiatric complications have been reported, including severe depression, anxiety, neurological attacks, psychomotor emotions, psychological symptoms, delusions, and even suicide.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine, as part of the public health system’s approach to tackling the spread of COVID-19, can make people anxious about the effects of contagion, quarantine, and notoriety among family and friends.
Therefore, psychosocial care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspects, people in contact with them, as well as the general public in need.
Psychological support should include establishing mental health teams from different disciplines, transparent communications with regular and detailed updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans, and using professional electronic devices and applications to prevent close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are necessary to cut off the chain of transmission from populations of animals and infected humans to susceptible hosts and are often used as complementary methods for antiviral therapy in the control of infectious diseases caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop vaccines based on protein S to produce strong and lasting neutralizing antibodies or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live-attenuated vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the effectiveness of these vaccines in the elderly and in severe, lethal models and their protection against common viral infections between humans and animals should be determined before the clinical trial begins.
This is probably because SARS was eradicated 17 years ago and since then no new cases have been reported.
In contrast, sporadic MERS cases and clusters in the Middle East continue to be seen and spread to other regions due to the availability of animal-to-human transmission resources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been proposed using passive virus, DNA plasmid, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and subunits of recombinant proteins, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune people is a vital task for epidemic control.
However, it is difficult to overcome this problem due to the long period of time required to develop a vaccine (average 18 months) and the dynamic changes of different CoV species.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has begun showing the full clinical course among thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients recover gradually and without complications.
However, like SARS and MERS, the COVID-19 virus is also associated with complications and high mortality in patients with acute cases.
Therefore, establishing a predictive model of disease flow is essential for healthcare organizations to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited facilities.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors can influence the prediction of the flow of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important predictor of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurs mainly between the ages of 30 and 65; in a study of 8,866 patients, 47.4% were over the age of 50.
Patients who needed intensive care were more likely to have underlying complications and abnormalities, and were older than those who did not need intensive care (the average age of the first group was 66 and the average age of the second group was 51). This suggests that age is a predictive factor in the course of the disease and determines the outcome in COVID-19 patients.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 affects more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Previous illnesses and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care were more likely to have acute heart damage and arrhythmias.
Heart events were also the leading cause of death for SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive collangiocytes, leading to liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and underlying diseases are strongly correlated and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: C-reactive protein levels in the blood indicate the severity of inflammation or damage to tissue and have been suggested to be a potential factor for disease, response to treatment, and final recovery.
The correlation of CRP levels with the severity and prediction of the flow of COVID-19 has also been suggested.
In addition, increasing lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict outcomes.
These enzymes are widely present in several organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released as a result of tissue damage.
Hence, as traditional symptoms are heart or liver disorders.
Major clinical symptoms: To predict the results and complications of COVID-19, chest radiography and the progression of clinical symptoms should be considered along with other issues.
Steroid use: As mentioned above, steroids are immune suppressors that are commonly used as a treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Because high doses of corticosteroids were widely used in patients with SARS, many people recovered from vascular osteonecrosis with lifelong disability and reduced quality of life.
Therefore, if needed, the steroid should be used at low doses and for a short time in COVID-19 patients.
Psychological stress: As described above, since the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients have suffered tremendous stress, often being quarantined for long periods of time and experiencing severe uncertainty, and witnessed the death of close family members and patients in their roommates.
Providing psychological counseling and long-term support is essential to helping these patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, the epidemiological features of COVID-19 appear to be different from those of SARS.
In addition to proliferating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively replicate in the upper respiratory tract and have mild or negligible symptoms in the first stage of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients in the first stage or incubation period can produce many viruses during daily activities, which can make it difficult to control the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission occurred when patients were severely ill and did not occur in the early stage of the disease.
Therefore, the COVID-19 outbreak is much more severe than the SARS outbreak and is more difficult to control.
Many efforts are already underway in China, including a ban on leaving homes in Wuhan and surrounding cities, and the ongoing quarantine of nearly the entire population in the hope of cutting off the transmission chain of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have severely damaged the economy and other parts of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating a slowdown in the disease.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the downtrend phase of the virus will continue for three to four months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter and colleagues have estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be essentially more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and colleagues developed a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic, and believe that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in mid-nose and throat swabs of patients who had left the hospital two weeks earlier and recovered, suggesting that the newly identified virus could become a cyclical disease similar to the flu.
However, there are promising signs in China based on a decrease in the number of new cases, suggesting that current strategies may work.
Initially, Ebola was predicted to cause one million infections and half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease eventually came under control.
Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may become less pathogenic and eventually disappear or become a low pathogenic virus that lives alongside humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 pandemic with SARS and MERS is shown below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through coughing or sneezing and is likely to be transmitted through direct contact with contaminated substances.
The virus has also been found in the stool, which allows transmission from the stool to the mouth.
A new study of 138 cases reported that 41 percent of cases were caused by hospital infections, including 17 patients with previous illnesses and 40 health care workers.
Therefore, it is advisable to be very cautious in protecting people, especially healthcare workers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even passersby who are in contact with patients or people with the disease.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is wearing a face mask, both through surgical masks and N95 respirators (Series 1860), which help control the spread of viruses.
The surgical mask prevents fluid droplets from passing through the air or sticking to the surface of the material where they can be passed on to others.
However, only N95 masks (1860 series) can protect a person from inhaling viral particles as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of viral particles can pass through it completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV, and both are approximately 85 nm.
Since the particles can even pass through five surgical masks stacked on top of each other, health care personnel in direct contact with patients should wear N95 masks, not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care personnel should wear isolation guns to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus while wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare workers should also wear transparent shields and glasses when working with patients.
For the general public in contaminated or potentially contaminated areas, it has been highly recommended that people wash their hands with disinfectant soaps more often than usual and try to stay home and limit contact with potentially infected people.
A three-foot (one meter) distance is considered a good distance for people to stay away from the patient.
These are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 entered the human world as a new virus, its high resemblance to SARS-CoV, reported on January 7, 2020, was a major warning for China based on deep memories of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, as of January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control was consoling citizens by saying that the new virus was contagious and limited in human-to-human transmission, and that there was no problem in preventing and containing the disease.
This message significantly reduced awareness of risk among the general public, especially when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical time to contain the disease was lost on a minimal scale in Wuhan.
China’s disease control agencies may have learned a hard lesson and will make major improvements in the future.
For example, these organizations should (1) be more careful considering that every single word spoken by targeted health organizations is important to citizens and can change people's attitudes and decisions; (2) they should be more sensitive to and responsive to the information received from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from physicians and authorities; and (3) they should be more effective in addressing the most restrictive measures.
The outbreak of COVID-19 was initiated by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the virus has spread across China and nearly 50 other countries around the world.
Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and there are similar symptoms between COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has created a sense of SARS recurrence.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, and knowing them is essential to containing the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than younger people and men more than women, and the death rate is higher in older people than in younger people.
SARS was more lethal than COVID-19 (10.91 percent vs. 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus even when they have no symptoms, while patients with SARS transmit the virus when they become seriously ill, which makes it harder to contain COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains in part why SARS-CoV-2 spread more and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing in SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, treated patients can be reinfected with the virus and test positive.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of spreading the virus.
Due to such rapid advances in COVID-19 research, several important issues remain unresolved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-like bats there is about 96% genetic homogeneity, we can't yet conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is from bats.
What animal, as an intermediate, transmitted the virus to humans from the main host, such as bats?
Without knowing the answers to questions 1 and 2, we can't effectively interrupt transmission, and outbreaks can recur at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical measurements have determined that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how does the virus enter the respiratory tract and cause subsequent disease-dependent changes?
Does the virus bind to ACE2 cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot achieve a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the outbreak continue?
How does the virus change genetically during human transmission?
Will the disease become a worldwide pandemic, such as SARS, gradually disappear or recur periodically, such as influenza?
The answers to the questions above are essential, but it may take some time to get to the answers to the questions above and many other questions.
However, at any cost that may be necessary, we have no choice but to stop the pandemic as soon as possible and return our lives to normal.
The origins of the human coronavirus
For thousands of years, adaptation and adaptation have led to the simultaneous evolution of the coronavirus (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illnesses such as the common cold.
The emergence of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), it showed on the coin how devastating and dangerous HCoV infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 brought the CoVs back to the spotlight and surprised us with its high contagion, but the symptoms of the disease were less severe compared to its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a common disease between humans and animals, and understanding the animal origin of HCoVs can help.
The origin of most HCoVs are bats that do not cause disease in their bodies.
Hosts that act as intermediate reservoirs of some HCoVs are also known.
Identifying animal hosts has a direct impact on disease prevention in humans.
Investigating CoV host interactions in animals can also provide important insights into the pathogenicity of CoV in humans.
In this review, we provide an overview of the existing knowledge of the seven HCoVs, focusing on their discovery history as well as animal origin and interspecies transmission.
The important thing to look at is the comparison of different HCoVs from the point of view of virus evolution and genetic recombination.
The current coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) is being discussed in this regard.
In addition, the need for a successful host change and the evolution of the virus for the severity of the disease is explored in this article.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, a group of enveloped viruses with positive polarity and single-stranded RNA.
These viruses, which have the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobytes among RNA viruses, are called "CoVs," due to their corona-like morphology under an electron microscope.
Structurally, CoVs have an integrated genome that shares a similar structure.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome consists of two large recycled reading frameworks (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted into pp1a and pp1ab polyprotein.
Polyprotein is processed further, producing 16 unstructured proteins called nsp1 to 16.
The remaining part of the genome contains ORF, which is used for structural proteins such as spike (S), wrapper (E), membrane (M) and nucleopropene (N).
A number of lateral proteins that are specific to ancestry have been encoded by different ancestors of CoVs.
Based on differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genomes (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV), among which the genus beta-CoV includes most HCoVs and is divided into four races (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents act as sources of alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are main reservoirs of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have consistently crossed species barriers, and some have emerged as important pathogens for humans.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been identified.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
Five other beta-CoVs are HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL6 usually cause mild symptoms such as colds or diarrhea.
In contrast, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are highly pathogenic, causing lower respiratory tract infection in most patients and more likely to cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the appearance of symptoms outside the lung.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was isolated from the nasal discharge of patients with common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, our knowledge has grown through extensive studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, the concept was widely accepted that HCoVs were generally harmless until SARS spread.
The SARS outbreak occurred in 2003, which is one of the most devastating outbreaks at the moment, affecting more than 8,000 people, with crude deaths of almost 10 percent.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) caused an epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula that spread widely throughout the rest of the world.
In 2019, the new HCoV (2019-nCoV), which was subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2, became the cause of the 2019 coronavirus pandemic, which killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 by March 3, 2020.
The alarm is ringing and the world needs to prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs have animal origins, including bats, mice, or pets.
There is a lot of evidence that the evolutionary origins of all HCoVs from bats are well adapted in these organisms, present asymptomatic, and show a lot of genetic variation.
The COVID-19 pandemic has created enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for China and the world.
Tracking the animal origin of the disease provides a framework for understanding the natural history, stimuli and limiting factors of species mutations.
It may also facilitate reservoir search, intermediate host and animal-boosting hosts of SARS-CoV-2, and have important implications in preventing future pandemics.
In this study, we will review the animal origin, interspecies transmission and pathogenicity of HCoVs.
Specifically, we highlight and discuss this common issue in which the parent HCoV viruses in their natural habitat are not typically pathogenic, but become pathogenic after interspecies transmission to the new host.
We also study the evolution of HCoVs, where increased viral contagion is often associated with reduced pathogenesis.
The implications of the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 are also discussed.
Animal CoVs have been known to us since the late 1930s.
Prior to the initial isolation of HCoV-229E strain B814, different CoVs were isolated from the nasal discharges of patients with common colds in different types of animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the date of discovery of HCoV in chronological order (Table 1) can be informative and contain good information.
In 1966, the first sequence of HCoV-229E virus was sampled from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection and then adapted for growth in WI-38 lung cell culture.
Patients with HCoV-229E had symptoms of common colds, including headaches, sneezing, weakness, and sore throat, with fever and cough in 10 to 20 percent.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture in the laboratory and gradually entered the brains of small mice.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229 E, which are not distinguishable from other respiratory infections in terms of symptoms, such as influenza A and rhinoviruses.
HCoV-229 and HCoV-OC43 are both spread globally and are mainly transmitted during winter in temperate climates.
Generally, the incubation time of the two viruses is less than a week, and after that, the disease lasts approximately two weeks.
According to studies in human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed mild colds.
In just a few patients with immunodeficiency, severe lower respiratory tract infection was observed.
The SARS disease, also known as "Pick Up Next pneumonia," is the first pandemic in human history to cause SARS-CoV, and the third HCoV discovered.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS outbreak caused 8,096 deaths and 774 deaths and spread to many countries and continents.
Except for super-emissions, it is estimated that each case can affect approximately two others, with a latency period of 4 to 7 days and peak viral load appearing on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients with SARS-CoV initially experienced muscle pain, headaches, fever, weakness, and chills, followed by shortness of breath, coughing, and respiratory dystrophy as subsequent symptoms.
Lymphopenia, a faulty liver function test, and increased serotonin kinase are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
Extensive alveoli degradation, epithelial cell proliferation and increased macrophages have also been observed in SARS patients.
Subsequently, about 20 to 30 percent of patients required intensive care and mechanical ventilators.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney, were affected in acute cases, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which could be particularly fatal in patients with immunodeficiency.
The virus was first sampled during an open lung biopsy by a relative of a prominent patient who had traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, a lot of research has been done on HCoVs.
HCoV-NL63 was separated from a 7-month-old baby from the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to be common in young children, older patients, and people with immunodeficiency with respiratory diseases.
Colds, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchitis are common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
In another independent study, the same virus was isolated from the nose sample of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although the virus was detected in the Netherlands, it actually spread globally.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is responsible for about 4.7 percent of chronic respiratory diseases, with peak prevalence occurring in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngeal inflammation, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was separated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized in Hong Kong with pneumonia and bronchitis.
In addition to pneumonia and bronchitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with acute asthma exacerbation.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1 is found worldwide and causes mild respiratory illness.
These four families are well adapted to humans and are generally less susceptible to severe illnesses, although cases occur for unknown reasons, such as in a rare case recently reported, the malignant variant HCoV-NL63 has caused lower respiratory tract infections in China.
Generally, when these HCoVs gain the ability to effectively transmit and sustain themselves in humans, virulence, or disease, decreases.
MERS-CoV was isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most laboratory-confirmed cases of the virus originate from the Middle East, imported cases have been reported with secondary spreads due to close contacts in various European countries and Tunisia.
A second outbreak in South Korea was confirmed in 2015 with 186 cases.
The clinical appearance of MERS is similar to that of SARS, known as advanced acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also had acute renal failure, which is specific to MERS among HCoV-induced diseases.
More than 30 percent of patients had gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, there were more than 2,500 confirmed laboratory fatalities of up to 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most dangerous viruses known to humans.
From mid-to-late December 2019, clusters of patients with SARS-CoV-2-related infectious diseases were identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak of the lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a global public health emergency, calling the disease COVID-19.
By March 3, 2020, the number of confirmed cases worldwide had reached 90,053, with a crude death toll of 3.4%.
The death toll in Hubei, China, was 4.2%, while outside it was 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causes a severe respiratory infection that is seen as fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Diarrhea is also seen in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly turn into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar, due to the high homology of the nucleotide sequence at 82%, they are clustered into different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but more transmissible.
Some people infected with SARS-CoV-2 reportedly had no symptoms, which could contribute to its rapid spread around the world.
Comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs shows significant similarities and differences.
The first is that the incubation period and duration of HCoVs are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general process of six other HCoVs.
Secondly, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is the median of SARS-CoV and four community-transmitted HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits features commonly seen in community-transmitted HCoV infections, including non-specific, mild, or in some cases no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of acute COVID-19 cases can also be seen in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 reveals interesting patterns of HCoVs and SARS-CoV transmitted from the community.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community-transmitted HCoVs.
On the other hand, it should be confirmed whether SARS-CoV-2's transmissibility decreases as much as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV after multiple transmissions between humans.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
Whether transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through feces or urine, such as SARS-CoV, plays an important role in transmission, at least in some circumstances, should be clarified by future studies.
It is also interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 may be seasonal, as is the case with community-transmitted HCoVs.
However, features of SARS-CoV-2, including transmissibility, pathogenicity, and sustained spread after transmission from person to person, will affect the final fate of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
All four community-transmitted HCoVs that cause mild symptoms are well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it may be true that humans are well adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both could be survivors of the ancient HCoV pandemic.
HCoVs that caused severe diseases in humans and humans who were infected with severe HCoVs have now been eliminated.
To do this, HCoVs must replicate in humans enough to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that neutralize host-limiting factors.
In this case, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people become infected, the greater the chance that the virus will fully adapt to humans.
If the virus is well adapted, it will be difficult to prevent its transmission in humans by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For several years, four community-acquired CoVs have circulated in human communities, causing common colds in people with healthy immune systems.
These viruses do not need to be sourced from animals.
In contrast, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to humans, and their transmission between humans cannot be sustained.
These viruses need to be preserved and disseminated in their animal reservoirs and are looking for opportunities to infect predisposed human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate and amplifying hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has features similar to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV and four HCoVs derived from the community.
The virus, like community-borne HCoVs, is highly transmissible, at least for the time being.
However, it is less pathogenic than community-transmitted HCoVs and more pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
We will have to wait and see if the virus fully adapts to humans and is transmitted between humans without intermediate reserves or animal hosts.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it would be helpful to examine the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and reproductive hosts of HCoVs.
If the animal shelter is a close-knit ancestor of a virus that has high homology at the level of nucleotide sequence, the animal acts as an evolutionary host of HCoV.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted in the host and is not pathogenic to it.
As such, a reservoir host shelters HCoV uninterruptedly and for long periods of time.
In both cases, the host is naturally infected and is the natural host of HCoVs or parent viruses.
In contrast, if HCoV has an intermediate host before infecting humans, or around the same time, it is not well adapted to the new host and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate host can act as an animal reservoir of human infection, increasing the level of infection in humans by allowing the virus to proliferate temporarily and then transmit it to humans.
HCoVs can cause deadly infections if they cannot sustain their transmission in the intermediate host.
Conversely, HCoVs can adapt to the intermediate host and even be present in the host group for a long time.
In this case, the intermediate host acts as a natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data show that the first person infected with SARS interacted with predatory animals.
A follow-up study of serological outbreaks found that anti-SARS levels of G-immunoglobin were higher in vendors of animal products than in the general population.
For the first time, a number of masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and a raccoon dog were detected in the live animal market carrying SARS-CoV-like viruses, which were almost identical to SARS-CoV.
A 29-nucleotide deletion characteristic for SARS-CoV has been found in strains taken at the beginning of the human epidemic.
At the same time, it has been reported that masked palm civets living in forests or farms that were not marketed in the live animal market were mainly negative for the presence of the SARS-CoV virus. This suggests that masked palm civets are probably just intermediate and replicating hosts, not the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It should be noted that 80% of different animals in Guangzhou markets have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, so the possibility that multiple species of small mammals may also act as intermediate booster hosts for SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out.
All of these appear to be the final hosts of SARS-CoV.
In the next search for the natural animal host of SARS-CoV, a variant of the coronavirus that was closely related to bat CoVs, called SARS-Rh-BatCoV HKU3, was found to be living in a Chinese horseshoe bat.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the sequence of the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome.
The virus and other bat CoVs share 88-92% nucleotide sequence similarity to SARS-CoV.
These studies have paved the way for a new theory that bats host new human pathogen viruses.
A number of SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) were also detected in bats, but they were unable to isolate any living virus except WIV1.
Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as a receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 obtained from bat stools showed that ACE2 was used by bats, sirot, and humans as receptors to enter the cell.
Interestingly, SARS patients' serums had the ability to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 has been the closest ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, with a 95% nucleonid sequence similarity.
Although there are many similarities between these two types of viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parent of SARS-CoV and bats are the immediate host of the SARS-CoV reservoir.
Phylogenetic analysis clusters MERS-CoV with similar groups such as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use a similar host receptor called dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for virus entry.
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences related to MERS-CoV are phylogenetically closer to bat beta-CoVs identified from Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
The MERS-CoV virus and its nearest relative, the bat CoV-HKU25, are only 87% similar in nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, bats cannot host the immediate reservoir of MERS-CoV.
Studies in the Middle East, on the other hand, have shown that monocotland camels are positive for MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, the same is true for Middle Eastern camels living in the African country.
Live MERS-CoV similar to the virus found in humans was sampled from a mountainous camel's nose and showed that camels host the true MERS-CoV reservoir.
It should be noted that symptoms are generally mild and highly excreted in camels who have been experimentally infected with MERS-CoV.
It is worth noting that infected camels spread the virus not only through the respiratory tract but also through the fecal-oral, which is also the main method of excreting the virus in bats.
However, one of the questions that has remained unanswered since that time is that in many cases MERS confirmed there was no history of contact with camels before symptoms appeared, possibly attributed to human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission pathways involving species of unknown animals.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus has a 96.2 percent nucleotide sequence similar to the CoV RaTG13 isolated bat.
Like cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the divergence of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is great for determining parental relationship.
In other words, bats cannot host the immediate reservoir of the SARS-CoV-2 virus unless bat CoVs are found almost identical in the future.
Possibly, the intermediate animal hosts of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, many of which have been identified in the early COVID-19 cases, should have been between wild animals sold and killed in the Hunan seafood market, indicating a possible transmission of the virus from animal to human.
Recent studies based on metagenomic sequences suggest that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) can also shelter ancestral beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This new genetic variant of the pangolin CoV has about 85 to 92% similar nucleotide sequences to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
However, these viruses are associated with about 90% nucleotide sequence similarity to RaTG13.
These viruses are clustered into two subcharges of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the phylogenetic tree, one of which has the same receptor binding range as SARS-CoV-2 and 97.4% of the same amino acid sequence.
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 differ more, with a higher degree of sequence similarity throughout the genome.
In a previous study conducted on patient pangolins, it was reported that from lung samples, fragments of viral DNA were isolated that were particularly linked to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used different methods of sequencing and manually modifying to create part of the genome sequence, which made up about 86.3% of the length of the virus's genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that SARS-CoV-2 originated in Pangolin, as there is a divergence between the sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2 pangolin.
In addition, the gap between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than the gap between SARS-CoV- and SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals is not yet known.
While most sequence homology has been seen in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, beta-CoVs associated with beta-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest genomic sequence homology.
It is speculated that the high degree of similarity between the beta-CoVs RBDs of SARS-CoV-2-related pangolin and SARS-CoV-2 is due to convergent evolution with selective intermediates.
Different from that, the proposal favors the recombination of beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2 pangolins and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
Recombination as a driving force in evolution is common among beta-CoVs.
The judgments on the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 have not been finalized.
Along with many pathogenic HCoVs, the animal origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 are still being studied.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229 may be derived from bat CoVs, while parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 are found in rodents.
The bat CoV, known as ARCoV2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV), has been reported to be closely related to HCoV-NL63 in North American tricolor bats.
On the other hand, HCoV-229 E is genetically related to another bat CoV called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, while Camelids are also suspected as the intermediate host of the virus.
To clarify, the existing knowledge about the animal origin of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for interspecies transmission of HCoVs in history.
In 1890, when HCoV-OC43 was transmitted between different animal species to infect humans through livestock, a pandemic of respiratory infections emerged.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is unclear.
Bat alpha-CoVs that are closely related to HCoV-229E have been found.
Among them is an alpaca alpha-CoV.
Numerous evidence supports the direct transmission of the virus by bats to humans.
First, humans, not alpacas, may interact with bats in a common ecological environment.
Humans, on the other hand, are closely related to alkapas.
Secondly, bat alpha-CoVs associated with HCoV-229E are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca alpha-CoV causes respiratory illness in animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, it is not possible to exclude the possibility that alpacas have received alpha-CoVs associated with HCoV-229E from humans.
In fact, bats are a direct source of pathogenic viruses in humans, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
On the other hand, while bat alpha-CoVs act as the gene pool of HCoV-229E, alpacas and ostrich camels may act as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, just as they were seen in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to camels and from camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from the bat was evident from the very beginning of its detection of the virus, and subsequent findings reinforced this theory.
It is clear that bats provide a rich reservoir of virus species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Long life, crowded colonies, close social interaction, and a strong ability to fly are all good conditions for a bat that makes him an ideal spreader of the virus.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been inserted into a mountain camel for decades.
The virus has adapted well to these camels, and the camel has evolved from an intermediate host to a stable and natural host.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and has a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
The occasional transmission of the virus from person to person is a coincidence, and the human host is a dead-end MERS-CoV because its transmission cannot be sustained.
Compared to the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolin is different in SARS-CoV-2 transmission if it is involved.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoV is highly pathogenic in pangolin.
These animals may be host to beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2, similar to the civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
There are several possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans, which should be accepted or rejected in future studies.
First, bats can host SARS-CoV-2-related viruses, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may share an ecological position with bats through butchering or coal mining.
Second, pangolins can be one of the intermediate enhancer hosts in which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus has just arrived.
Humans are infected with the virus through butchering and consumption of hunting meat.
It is possible that many mammals, including pets, are at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2.
Domestic and wild animals are essential for antibodies.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species that has come into contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
Apart from the different types of animal hosts, three other factors from the virus are also important to facilitate the passage of CoVs through existing barriers.
First of all, the rate of mutations is relatively high in their RNA replication.
The estimated mutation rate in the CoV virus, with an average replacement rate, is equivalent to about 4-10 replacements per year per site 2, depending on the CoV's adaptation stage to the new host, which can be considered "average" to "high" compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses.
CoVs have an exoribonuclease error-correcting effect, which can lead to a very high mutation, mortality, or even failure to survive.
Interestingly, Remdesivir is a nucleotide analogue by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent polymerase to prevent CoV proliferation.
Remdesivir is one of the promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that should be tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rate of CoVs is about a million times higher than that of their hosts.
In addition, mutation rates are high when CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be lower, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It is likely that the virus has now adapted to another host that is close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well-adapted to a camel.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic change could quickly make vaccines and antivirals ineffective against SARS-CoV-2.
Second, the large genome of RNA in CoVs provides the surplus flexibility to modify the genome for genetic mutations and recombination, thereby increasing the likelihood of cross-species transformation, which, under appropriate circumstances, contributes to the emergence of new CoVs.
This is supported by a large number of unique open reading frameworks and protein functions that are coded towards the end of the genome.
Third, CoVs randomly and repeatedly change the templates during RNA replication through a unique "copy-select" mechanism.
In hosts that act as a mixing reservoir, string replacements occur frequently during the transcription of CoV RNA.
Subgenomic, fully matched long-range RNAs can be recombined to produce new CoVs.
In both HCoV - HKU1 and HCoV - OC43, as well as animal CoVs such as bat - CoV and bat CoV - HKU9, phylogenetic evidence for natural recombination has been found.
The interaction of the virus - the host in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors described above, the virus’s interaction with the host receptor is another key factor influencing interspecies transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is considered to be a typical sample, showing evidence of positive selection during the interspecies transmission event.
Based on a comparative analysis between human isolated samples and Sioux SARS-CoVs, it is thought that SARS-CoV adapts rapidly in different hosts, especially with mutations in RBD protein S.
Generally, the RBD in the S-CoV virus protein interacts with the cell receptor and triggers a severe antibody response from the host.
In SARS-CoV, it is found in amino acids 318 to 510 and on the fergus S1, which binds to the human ACE2 and the common receptors for virus entry.
RBD SARS virus - CoV is capable of detecting ACE2 receptors from various animals, including bats, siottes, mice and raccoon dogs, allowing interspecies transmission to the virus.
In fact, it was observed that only the remaining 6 amino acids were different from the viral samples taken from humans and Sivet in RBD, and four of them were in the binding-receptor motif for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
SARS-CoV Sivet has a mutation of K479N and S487T in its RBD, which may increase the desire for clove protein interaction with human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be vital for viral adaptation to humans.
SARS-CoV-2 has a cellular receptor similar to SARS-CoV.
The presence of a 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 protein S unit suggests that the tendency to bind the S protein to the human ACE2 may have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study suggests that there is a 10 to 20-fold tendency for this link between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another common receptor is needed for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but with another part of S.
There are many HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
These receptors may also explain the successful adaptation of these CoVs in humans after interspecies transmission from animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of interspecies transmission of HCoVs is also controlled by other host and restrictive factors.
The divergence of host proteins between humans and natural HCoV hosts, such as bats, mongol camels, and rodents, may create barriers to interspecies transmission.
For an interspecies transmission to be successful, HCoV must control host-dependent agents and eliminate host-limiting agents.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important field of virus-host interaction should be identified and identified.
Completely unbiased genome-level screening of host dependency and limiting factors for SARS-CoV-2 using advanced CRISPR technology may be fruitful.
Genesis of New HCoVs: From the Beginning
The diversity of bat CoVs has provided ample opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this case, bat CoVs act as a reservoir of the HCoV gene.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombination also advance the evolution of HCoVs and serve as two important stages in the process.
For example, gaining or losing new protein-coding genes has the potential to drastically alter the virus's phenotypes.
Among the lateral proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 is thought to play an important role in human adaptation, because after isolating the bat virus associated with SARS-CoV, it was found that the virus encodes different ORF8 proteins.
The deletion feature of the nucleotide-29 SARS-CoV virus has been observed in isolated strains at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This deletion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that helps to change the host.
Additionally, SARS-CoV has a possible recombinant history with the ancestors of alpha and gamma CoVs, in which a large number of smaller recombinant domains in RNA-dependent polymerase were identified.
Recombination sites were identified in nsp9, most of nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
The MERS-CoV virus has also been shown to cause the pandemic to experience recombination events between different ancestors that occurred in the Arabian monsoon camel.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, a recombinant event has also been observed in other HCoVs where HCoVs combine with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can contribute to unwanted changes in the viral genome, most likely due to the release of viruses from selective pressure, for example by the host's immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the prototyping race of HCoV-229E due to the removal of two nucleotides.
Although intact and complete ORF4 can be found in bats and camel-related HCoV-229 E viruses, alpaca alpha-CoV with an additional single nucleotide leads to a framework change.
Last but not least, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by selective pressure in their reservoir hosts.
Lack of mild signs or symptoms was detected when bats were infected with CoVs, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
Bats appear to have adapted well to CoVs, both anatomically and physiologically.
For example, a defect in activating the pre-inflammatory reaction in bats effectively reduces the damage caused by CoVs.
In addition, natural killer cell activity in bats is suppressed due to the reset of NKG2/CD94 inhibitory killer cell receptor and low levels of tissue adaptation of large complex molecules of class I.
In addition, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by high metabolic activity of bats can both suppress CoV proliferation and affect readiness of the exoribonuclease effect, thereby providing selective pressure to produce highly pathogenic strains of the virus when it enters a new host.
The most pathogenic CoV strains may result in recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to accommodate the host.
So, it’s no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are not pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
These viruses replicate strongly without encountering a host's strong immune response.
Here are some secrets as to why asymptomatic carriers are seen and what causes severe cases in humans.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the intense immune system activity and cytokine storm, in which the stronger the immune system response, the more severe the damage to the lung.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response is different from CoV replication.
The strategy of isolating the immune response may have beneficial effects in treatment with the anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug.
Interferon responses in bats are particularly strong.
Therefore, interferon-type I management should be helpful, at least in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflamazom is defective in bats.
With this argument, inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome along with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general theme of the events of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While bat beta-CoV has 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is also a bat beta-CoV that has 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While civets and other animals in the market have been found to be harboring viruses such as SARS-CoV, the immediate intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been identified.
Pangolinic beta-CoVs, which are very similar to SARS-CoV-2, have been found and suggest that pangolins may act as one of the intermediate hosts, or pangolinic beta-CoVs can contribute to gene fragments in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
There is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally created by humans.
CoVs have returned to the center of attention due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has drastically changed our understanding of the importance of HCoV's origin and animal reservoirs in human transmission.
Comprehensive evidence has shown that the origins of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infection stems from contact between humans and civets in markets, closing the marine animal market and killing civets effectively ended SARS.
With the same argument, pangolins should be removed from the marine animal market to prevent transmission of animals to humans, due to the discovery of several beta-CoV pangolin ancestry closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, clarification of how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted from pangolins and other mammals to humans still needs to be done in future research.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been present in mountain camels for a long time.
These camels serve as an important means of transportation, as well as the main source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local population.
These camels are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as was done in the wild animal market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective anti-MERS-CoV vaccines for camels, along with other pollution control measures.
Because we are not able to remove these viruses, new genotypes may emerge and cause outbreaks.
A variety of common CoVs between humans and animals are circulating in the wild.
Specifically, bat CoVs with the potential to transmit from animal to human are very diverse.
There are many opportunities for these common human-animal CoVs to grow and recombine, leading to the emergence of new CoVs that are highly transmissible and lethal.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China must be abandoned to reduce unnecessary communication between humans and animals.
With the rigorous testing that SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 have given us, we need to have a better plan for preparedness and response.
In fact, many viruses have existed on this planet for a long time.
They stay in their natural reservoirs until there is an opportunity to overflow.
Although bats have many characteristics that contribute to the spread of viruses, if people are trained to avoid them, the chances of humans getting in contact with bats and other wildlife can be minimized.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is essential for a better understanding of the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts and will be useful in preventing animal transmission to humans and its spread.
As a result, the most effective way to prevent common viruses between humans and animals is to keep humans away from the ecological clones of common viruses between humans and animals.
Several pieces of the puzzle of animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been found.
First, if bats have transmitted an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to see under what conditions bats and pangolins could coexist in a common ecological situation.
Second, if bats play a direct role in human transmission, how did humans come into contact with bats?
Third, if a third-party mammal acts as a real intermediate host, how does it interact with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolins?
And finally, since many mammals, including pets, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both experimental care and contagion should be taken.
The animal in question is a bat, pangolin, or any other mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or its parents' viruses, which are almost identical, are expected to be detected in their natural hosts in the future.
Continuous research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Updating COVID-19 diagnostic criteria is required in case of “suspicious” and “confirmed” cases
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick guide to the detection and treatment of 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV), providing our experience and a good reference for combating the pandemic around the world.
However, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical experience; hence, diagnostic and treatment strategies are constantly being updated.
In this paper, we provided a perspective on our guidelines and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for “suspicious cases” and “approved cases” based on the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh edition) issued by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China.
In December 2019, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak that is now officially known as the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), also called acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2, our team created a quick guide and published it online in the Journal of Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
This guide has attracted a lot of attention since its publication.
Keep in mind that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical experience; hence, diagnostic and treatment strategies are constantly updated.
For example, the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), published between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, have been published a total of seven times, in which some texts have been altered.
Zhou and colleagues now have a view on our guide that includes a simple scoring proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their paper added new evidence to our guide and also provided a valuable reference for the pandemic around the world.
We acknowledge their outstanding work and express our gratitude.
However, their paper should be updated in accordance with the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh edition) and recent studies.
According to the 7th edition (March 3, 2020), to confirm suspected cases, one of the characteristics of the history of the pandemic must be combined with two of the most obvious clinical symptoms to provide a comprehensive analysis, or if it lacks a history of the pandemic, it must meet three of the most obvious clinical symptoms:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities in which cases of COVID-19 have been reported within 14 days of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with patients with SARS-CoV-2 (positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory disease from Wuhan and surrounding areas or other communities who have reported symptoms during the preceding 14 days.
Clinical symptoms: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) pictured features of COVID-19 infection; (3) a total number of white blood cells, indicating a normal, decreased number of lymphocytes in the early stage of the onset of the disease.
Diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on suspected cases with one of the following pathogens or serological evidence: 1) real-time PCR test to detect SARS-CoV-2; 2) sequence of the entire virus genome stage that shows a high homogeneity with the new coronavirus. (3) Positive in terms of specific IgM antibodies and serum IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2; or change of the Ig-neg antibody level above.
We can see that the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in the respiratory tract or blood samples has been added to the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) edition.
Pathogenic diagnosis was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) edition, and then serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers looking for an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, and also based on respiratory system sampling including blood sampling, which gives more access to different samples and supports the positiveness of certain antibodies in the approved criteria.
In addition, there is additional evidence that warns us to deal with unusual symptoms and patients without symptoms with caution.
Therefore, the Zhou and colleagues chart should be updated, as in this flowchart an individual who does not have clinical symptoms is classified as “low risk”.
The rating system should also be approved in practice and with further clinical studies.
To sum it up, we hope that more direct evidence will be brought up and we ask readers to give their opinions.
To diagnose “suspicious” and “confirmed” cases, we suggest that doctors follow and follow the latest guidelines from their countries.
Our team will also regularly provide guidance to provide up-to-date help.
Bangladesh reported five new COVID-19 deaths, the highest daily number to date.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 on this day.
This is the highest number of daily deaths due to the virus.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the recorded cases included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases that rested at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, director of IEDCR, said in an online news briefing that the death toll was four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two were over 60 years of age, two were between 50 and 60 years of age, and one was between 41 and 50 years of age.
He added that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
A hospital staffer told the local news agency Anadolu that one of the dead was Jalal Sifur Rahman, a director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission who was being monitored at the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, Bangladesh’s Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaidul Quader, announced in an online video announcement that public transport would be shut down by next Saturday, more than originally planned.
The shutdown of public transport began on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of essential goods – medical goods, fuel and food – continued.
The first case of COVID-19 recorded in Bangladesh on March 8 was two passengers who had returned from Italy, as well as the wife of one of the passengers.
On March 19, the three men recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than a million people worldwide.
Johns Hopkins University data shows that on Thursday, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 cases worldwide exceeded one million.
At least 52,000 deaths are attributed to COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
With the first confirmed case of the coronavirus in Malawi and the first death related to the coronavirus in Zambia, the day became a turning point.
On Thursday, North Korea claimed to be one of the few countries free of coronavirus.
The World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases as of yesterday, of which 79,332 were from 24 hours before Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been recorded, leading to at least 5,900 deaths.
According to data from Johns Hopkins University, more than 1,000 deaths were recorded in the United States on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have taken stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.

Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state has extended home quarantine regulations until May 1.
Australian stores cut the share of toilet paper purchases per purchase
The Woolworths and Coles stores in Australia, on Saturday and Sunday evenings, reduced the restrictions on the purchase of toilet paper in all stores across the country to two and one pack per purchase, respectively.
The ALDI store also announced a packet purchase restriction on Monday.
The restrictions are announced in the form of messages on the boxes and on the Facebook page of the chain stores.
According to reports, shoppers are buying and storing out of fear of the need for personal quarantine due to the COVID-19 outbreak.
Also on Wednesday, Woolworths limited the purchase of toilet paper for home delivery to one package per order.
The changes were followed by a limitation of the previous four packages per purchase announced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
In a press release on March 8, Coles said that despite a four-pack purchase limit, "many stores will be closed within an hour," describing the demand as "unprecedented," while ALDI described it as "unexpected" on its Facebook page on Tuesday.
According to a Woolworths spokesperson, sales have experienced a “severe increase” in the past week.
The Costco store in Canberra also limited the allowable purchases to two packages last week.
To alleviate this shortage, Coles has ordered larger packages to suppliers and increased the number of deliveries to stores, Woolworths has ordered more inventory. ALDI has made the inventory of one of Wednesday’s special sales plans available earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retail Association, said retailers were trying to increase inventory, but local council restrictions on the timing of delivery trucks made it difficult.
He said he expects production costs to rise as suppliers try to respond to demand and special sales are reduced.
On Tuesday, the ALDI store announced that some stores would not be able to hold special sales on Wednesday due to earlier inventory releases.
Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said in a report on News.com.au that stores fill their inventory every night.
He added that the bulkiness of the toilet paper leads to the inventory being small in number, and when the product is finished, it leaves a lot of space on the shelves and creates a sense of scarcity.
Russell Zimmerman said in ABC News that Coles and Woolworths believe that if there are a lot of products on the shelf, if products like toilet paper and disinfectants are available in high numbers and you can buy them, your fears will probably be minimized.
Who Gives a Crap, a recycled toilet paper manufacturer, announced on Wednesday that their inventory was running out.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, which produces Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which produces Sorbent toilet paper, emphasize that they operate 24/7 to meet existing demand.
Domain.com, one of the real estate sites, reported that when fewer auctions were held due to the closure of shoppers on Labor Day weekends, some property vendors donated free toilet paper to the first bidders in Melbourne.
Thursday's edition of NT News, one of Darwin's newspapers, had an eight-legged special letter to be cut and used as toilet paper.
According to an ABC Australia report on March 3, these stores were originally reluctant to impose restrictions and said they had no plans to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that there is a high demand for other goods, including masks, disinfectants, dry goods, liquids and toilet soap and flour.
Outside of Australia, the British online supermarket Ocado, on Sunday evening, saw restrictions on the purchase of toilet paper by Andres for two packs of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the pandemic a COVID-19 outbreak caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
Although the word “pandemic” only refers to the spread of a disease, not how dangerous it is, the WHO stressed the need to push governments to take countermeasures:
All countries can still change the duration of this pandemic.
WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that countries would have their own people diagnosed, tested, treated, quarantined and tracked if they were ready.
We are deeply concerned, both by the alarming level of the outbreak and its severity, and by the alarming level of inadequate action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, the former head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “unprecedented.”
In a statement released by CNN in February, he said: “Except for the flu, no other respiratory virus has been tracked, from the emergence to the ongoing global outbreak.
In a similar statement, Ghebreyesus said: "We have never seen a pandemic that was caused by a coronavirus before."
“And we’ve never seen a pandemic that is manageable at the same time.”
The new situation was declared a pandemic after the WHO’s decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency with international concern.
Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said: “The frontline situation is getting worse.”
The Associated Press reported on Thursday that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, leading to more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and declared a public health emergency with international concern on January 30, 2020, and became known as the pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, about 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, leading to about 97,000 deaths.
Approximately 364,000 people have recovered.
The mortality rate in China is estimated to be around 4%, while globally it has ranged from 0.08% in New Zealand to 13.04% in Algeria.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications can include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from the virus to the onset of symptoms is usually around five days, but can range between two and 14 days.
There is no known vaccine or specific treatment for it.
Primary treatment is treatment of symptoms and supportive treatment. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth when coughing, staying away from other people, and monitoring and self-quarantine for people who are suspected of contracting the disease.
Authorities around the world have responded to the virus by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, military rule, risk control at work, and closures.
The pandemic has led to severe socioeconomic disruption, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and the widespread scarcity of resources exacerbated by neuro-buying.
Schools and universities have been shut down in 193 countries, either nationally or locally, affecting 99.4% of the world’s students.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese and other people of East and Southeast Asian descent, as well as people from areas with widespread spread of the virus.
Due to travel restrictions and heavy industry closures, air pollution and carbon emissions have been reduced.
Health officials in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported a group of cases of pneumonia with unknown cause on December 31, 2019, and in early January 2020, the investigation began.
These were mainly related to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which is why the virus is thought to have an animal origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronavirus, pangolin coronavirus, and SARS-CoV.It was later revealed that the first known person with symptoms became ill on December 1, 2019, and that the person did not have any apparent contact with the next group related to the seafood market.
Of the initial cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were linked to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Morning Post claimed that one case had been traced on November 17, 2019, a 55-year-old man from Hubei province who could be the first. On February 26, 2020, the WHO reported that despite the decline in cases in China, according to reports, there has been a sudden increase in cases, and for the first time the number of new cases outside China has been taken from the number of new cases inside China.
The number of cases may be significantly lower than reported in reality, especially among people with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, a relatively small number of cases had been reported among young people, and those aged 19 and under accounted for only 2.4% of cases worldwide.The UK's chief scientific adviser Patrick Valance estimated that about 60% of the UK population should be infected to allow for effective collective safety.
In cases, the number of people who have tested for COVID-19 has been reported positive based on official protocols.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries, including Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, have adopted an official policy not to test people with only mild symptoms.
A study published on March 16 found that as of January 23, 86% of COVID-19 cases had not been identified, and these unregistered cases were the source of 79% of cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of cases in Italy exceeded the number reported.
Initial estimates of the base contagion number (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the number could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the interval between the onset of symptoms and death was between 6 and 41 days, and the most common was 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths were in people over the age of 60, and 70% of them had underlying diseases, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official figures of the number of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to those who tested positive for COVID-19, according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 can be much higher, as these figures may not include people who have died without testing - at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Incomplete data from Italy showed that the number of undiagnosed deaths during the pandemic was about 4-5 times higher than the official Covid death toll.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said: “We know [the reported death toll] is lower than the actual rate,” this sentence corresponds to informal reports that the statistics are lower in the United States. Such actions often occur in pandemics, including in the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. The first confirmed death occurred on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines and the first death outside Asia on February 14 in France.
By 28 February, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of March 13, deaths were reported in more than forty countries and territories across all continents except Antarctica. Various measurements are commonly used to measure mortality rates.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the amount of testing, the quality of the health system, treatment options, time spent on the initial outbreak, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health status. The mortality rate is achieved by dividing the number of deaths by the total number of cases diagnosed over a time period.
According to Johns Hopkins University, the global mortality rate as of April 10, 2020 is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
This number is different in each region.
In China, the estimate of mortality rate dropped from 17.3% (for people with symptoms beginning January 1-10, 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms beginning after February 1, 2020). Other measurements include case fatality rate (CFR), which shows the percentage of people diagnosed dying from a disease, and the IFR death rate for an uninfected person (IFR) who dies from a disease.
These statistics do not have a time limit and follow a specific population from catching up to solving a case.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The University of Oxford’s Evidence-Based Medicine Center estimates that the overall fatality rate for the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The maximum estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized COVID-19 test in Germany, as well as the statistical study that analyzes the effect of the test on CFR estimates.
The WHO insists that the pandemic is manageable.
In the case of the peak and the final duration of the outbreak, it is not possible to say for certain and may vary by location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University said: “Common infectious diseases usually stabilize if no action is taken to control them and begin to decline when the disease is removed from the available hosts.
But for now, it’s impossible to make any reasonable predictions about when this will happen.
Zhong Nanshan, chief medical adviser of the Chinese government, argued that if all countries were mobilized to follow WHO recommendations on countermeasures for the spread of the virus, “the disease could end by June.”
Adam Kucharski of the London School of Health and Tropical Medicine announced on March 17 that SARS-CoV-2 would "likely be circulating for a year or two".
According to research led by Neil Ferguson at Royal College, physical distancing and other measures will be necessary “until a vaccine is developed (possibly 18 months or more).”
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: “I think the likelihood of this coronavirus disappearing completely is low – because it’s easily transmissible – and it may become a seasonal disease that returns every year.”
The severity of this return will depend on the collective immunity and the severity of the mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively nonspecific, and people with COVID-19 may be without symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Symptoms that are less common include fatigue, production of sputum, loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, blood-raising, diarrhea and cyanose. The World Health Organization says that about one in six people become severely ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has published a list of emergency symptoms: difficulty breathing, feeling pain or persistent pressure in the chest, sudden distress, difficulty waking, bruising of the face and lips; if these symptoms occur, immediate medical attention is recommended. Further progression of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and even death.
Some people with the disease may have no symptoms, no clinical symptoms, but the test results confirm that they have the disease, so researchers have recommended that people who have close contact with people with the disease should be closely monitored and tested to prevent infection.
The estimates made by China ranged from the rate of people without symptoms from very small amounts to 44%.
The typical incubation period (the time between the onset of a person and the appearance of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; in the most common case, this period is five days. As an example of uncertainty, the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lose their sense of smell was initially 30% but later reduced to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still being worked out.
It is thought to spread mainly through close contact by small particles produced by coughing, sneezing, or talking; and close contact means a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Research has shown that uncoated coughing can spread small particles between 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some research has suggested that the virus can also be transmitted by small particles produced by speech that remain in the air for longer periods of time. Although the virus is generally not airborne, tiny respiratory particles can be produced by breathing, including speech.
These tiny particles can land in the mouth or nose of nearby people or be transported to their lungs through breathing.
Some medical procedures, such as respiratory intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can result in respiratory discharge spraying in the air, resulting in an outbreak of airborne disease.
It is also transmitted when a person touches an infected surface, including the skin, and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
While there are concerns about the possibility of transmission of the disease through feces, the risk is thought to be low.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2.Although it is possible to transmit the disease before symptoms and later stages of the disease appear, the most common infection is within the first three days of symptoms appearing.
People who tested positive for the disease up to three days before symptoms appeared show that transmission is possible before significant symptoms appear.
There have been few reports of lab-approved cases of non-symptomatic transmission, but no-symptomatic transmission has been detected by some countries during communications tracking research.
The European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) said that while it is not entirely clear how the disease spreads quickly, one infected person can usually infect two or three other people. The virus survives on different surfaces, from hours to days.
Specifically, it has been found that the virus survives for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304 surfaces, up to one day on cardboard and up to four hours on copper.
However, these values can vary depending on humidity and temperature. So far, there have been cases of positive results from testing of pets and other animals for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however, British authorities recommend that people wash their hands after contact with animals, just as they do with other surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus that was first identified in three people with pneumonia who came into contact with a group of people with acute respiratory illness in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in related coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap that removes its protective coating. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The virus is believed to have an animal origin.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus is genetically derived from the Betacoronavirus subspecies, the sarbovirus (Gene B), along with two bat-derived genes.
The virus at the genome level corresponds to 96 other bat bat coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13) samples.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one amino acid difference between pangolins and humans in certain parts of their genome sequence.
A comparison of the full genome to date has concluded that up to 92% of the genetic material is shared between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove that pangolins are intermediate hosts.
Infected by the virus, it can be temporarily detected through symptoms, however the final confirmation is made through the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or CT imaging.
Research comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, yet less specific because it overlaps many of the features of CT imaging with other inflammatory lung diseases and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that “CT should not be used as a screening or initial test to diagnose COVID-19.”
The World Health Organization has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.
This test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test can be done on respiratory and blood samples.
The results of this test are usually determined between a few hours and a few days.
Usually, this test is done with a nasopharyngeal swab, however, a throat swab can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are working on serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these methods have been accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex for emergency use has only been approved by some accredited laboratories.
Characteristic characteristics of imaging in radiographs and computerized tomography (CT) of people with symptoms include asymptomatic peripheral Grand Glass views and lack of peripheral imaging.
The Italian Radiology Association is compiling an international online database of imaging findings from confirmed cases of the disease.
Imaging without confirmation by PCR, due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, cannot be used specifically to detect COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the results of chest CT to PCR and found that while less imaging is specifically used to diagnose the disease, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting that it should be used as a screening tool in areas with epidemics.
Artificial intelligence-based twist neural networks have been developed to detect the imaging features of the virus by both radiography and CT.
Some methods to prevent transmission of the disease include proper hygiene, washing your hands, not touching your eyes, nose, or mouth, sitting with your hands, taking a napkin while coughing or sneezing, and dropping a napkin directly into the trash can.
Those who already have the disease are advised to wear surgical masks in public settings.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission of the disease. Many governments have banned or recommended non-essential travel to countries or areas where the disease is common.
However, the virus has reached an epidemic stage in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some people do not know where or how they have been infected. People who provide health care for potential infected people are advised to follow standard precautions, take contact precautions, and use eye protection. Tracking contacts is one of the important ways for health authorities to detect the source of infection and prevent further transmission.
The use of mobile location information by governments for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement limiting this kind of surveillance.
Various mobile apps have been created or proposed to be voluntarily used, and by April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on solutions that do not violate privacy, such as using Bluetooth to record how close the user is to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they are in close contact with a person with COVID-19.Some misconceptions about how to prevent the disease are spreading, such as nasal washing or gurgling with a mouthwash, are not effective ways.
Although many organizations are trying to develop a vaccine, there is still no vaccine for COVID-19.
To prevent the spread of the disease, hand washing is recommended.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after the toilet or when the hands are clearly dirty; before eating; after emptying the nose, coughing or sneezing.
This is because the virus is killed outside the human body with household soap, which destroys its protective bubble.
The CDC also recommends using alcohol-based disinfectants with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not readily available.
The World Health Organization recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose and mouth with their hands.
It is possible to remove contamination from surfaces in a variety of ways (one minute exposure to antiseptics for stainless steel surfaces), including 71-62% ethanol, 100-50% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 7.5-0.2% betadiene.
Other methods, including benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that all departments, such as offices, toilets, common areas, common electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATMs used by sick people should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with their elbows or napkins when coughing or sneezing, and remove the napkin immediately.
For people who are likely to be infected, surgical masks are recommended because wearing a mask can reduce the volume and spacing of the particles that are scattered when talking, sneezing, or coughing.
The World Health Organization has issued guidelines on when and how to wear a mask.
According to the University of Leeds virologist Stephen Griffin, “Wearing a mask can reduce people’s desire to touch their faces, which is an important source of infection if they don’t have proper hand hygiene.”
The World Health Organization recommends wearing a mask by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those taking care of people with COVID-19, however, they also acknowledge that wearing a mask helps people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage community members to wear face masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the use of non-medical masks made from fabric. China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy community people, especially when in close contact with other people (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong has recommended wearing a surgical mask when using public transport or stopping in crowded places.
Thai health officials are urging people to make masks at home using cloth and wash them on a daily basis.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from going out to public without wearing a mask or covering their mouth and nose.
On March 16, Vietnam called on all people to wear masks when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Australian government has made wearing masks mandatory for those who visit grocery stores.
Israel has urged all its residents to wear a mask while attending the gathering.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million masks per day since mid-March, has required passengers on trains and intercity buses to wear masks since April 1.
Panama has made it compulsory to wear a mask when going out and has advised those who cannot buy a mask to make their own homemade masks.
Masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes pollution control measures aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
These include quarantines; travel restrictions; closures of schools and workplaces, stadiums, theaters and shopping malls.
People can practice these practices by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, greetings without touch, and physical distance from others.
Currently, many governments in areas where the disease is spreading have made or recommended social distancing compulsory.
The maximum number of people gathering recommended by U.S. government agencies and health agencies was rapidly reduced from 250 (if there were no COVID-19 outbreaks in the region) to 50 and later to 10.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned gatherings of more than two people. The physical age group and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, blood pressure, and immune deficiencies are at a higher risk of severe complications, and the CDC recommends that people stay home as much as possible in areas where the disease has spread.
The use of the term "social distancing" instead of encouraging people to maintain communication using alternative methods implied that people should enter complete social isolation. Some authorities issued guidelines on sexual hygiene for use during the pandemic.
The guidelines included recommendations to only have sex with someone you live with, someone who does not have the virus or does not have symptoms of the virus.
For people who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who are suspected to be infected, a personalized home quarantine is recommended.
Health organizations have outlined detailed guidelines for proper personal quarantine. Many governments have mandated or recommended personal quarantine for all people living in areas affected by the virus.
The strictest personal quarantine guidelines are issued for those in high-risk groups.
Those who may have been in contact with people who have been in contact with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region where the disease has spread widely have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days since the last contact.
Strategies for controlling an outbreak of a disease include containment, suppression and mitigation.
Inhibition is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak with the aim of tracking and isolating the infected, as well as introducing other measures to control the disease and vaccination to stop the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts are shifted to a mitigation strategy: measures are being taken to reduce the prevalence and mitigate its impact on the health system and society.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures can be implemented at the same time.
Suppression requires more intensive measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the number of basic contagion to less than 1. Part of the management of the outbreak of an infectious disease is an effort to reduce the peak of the pandemic, known as smoothing the curve of the pandemic.
This reduces the risk of too much pressure on health services and provides more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help manage the spread of the disease include personal preventive measures including hand hygiene, wearing masks, personal quarantine; social measures aimed at physical distancing, including school closures and cancellations of events in which there are high gatherings of people; social participation to encourage acceptance and compliance of these interventions; as well as environmental measures such as cleaning surfaces. When the high severity of the disease outbreak in China was identified, more stringent measures were implemented in order to contain the entire travel ban.
Other countries have also implemented a series of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea conducted group screening and local quarantine and issued warnings about the movement of infected people.
Singapore provided financial support for people who quarantined themselves and imposed heavy fines for those who did not.
Taiwan increased mask production and imposed penalties for the hoarding of medical supplies. Simulations conducted for Britain and the United States show that the strategy of reducing (reducing the spread of the pandemic rather than stopping it) and suppressing (reversing the growth of the pandemic) faces major challenges.
Optimal cut policies could reduce peak health demand by 2.3 percent and mortality rates by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and excessive pressure on the health system.
Suppression could be a better strategy, but as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or as long as a vaccine is developed, if it happens earlier), it should be maintained, because if the action is abandoned, the infection rate will quickly return to the previous level.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic creates social and economic costs.
There are no approved antiviral drugs for COVID-19, although efforts are underway to build it, including testing existing drugs.
Using medications without a cold prescription, drinking fluids, and resting can help reduce symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid injections, and breathing aids may be required.
Using steroids can make things worse.
Several compounds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated to be useful in treating COVID-19.
The World Health Organization has also announced "a few traditional and home remedies" that can help relieve symptoms of SARS-CoV-19.
The World Health Organization has described increasing capacity and adapting the health system to the needs of COVID-19 patients as one of the key measures to combat the outbreak.
The ECDC and the European Regional Office of the World Health Organization have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to move resources to different levels, including focusing laboratory services on testing COVID-19, canceling unnecessary surgical procedures where possible, isolating and isolating COVID-19 patients, and increasing intensive care capacity by training personnel and increasing the number of ventilators and beds available.
There are different opinions about where the first case (the so-called patient zero) originated.
The first case of the new coronavirus may return to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
Most of these people were associated with the wholesale market of Huana seafood, which also sells live animals, and one theory is that the virus originated from a species of animal, i.e. it originated in animals. A group of people with pneumonia with an unknown cause were observed on December 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, which informed Wuhan Chang on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "sars-like coronavirus."
Police advised eight of the doctors, including Li Wenliang, to refrain from spreading false rumours, and another doctor, Ai Fen, was punished by his superiors for giving the warning.
Later, the Wuhan City Health Commission issued a public notice on December 31, notifying the World Health Organization of the matter.
Many cases of pneumonia with unknown cause were reported to Wuhan health authorities, prompting investigations in early January. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled, approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus was transmitted to other provinces in China with the help of Chinese New Year travel, with Wuhan being one of the main transit hubs and rail exchange centers.
On January 20, 2020, China reported about 140 new cases, including one in Beijing and one in Shenzhen, within a day.
Later official data showed that 6,174 people had symptoms as of January 20, 2020.As of March 26, the United States surpassed China and Italy with the highest confirmed cases in the world.As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.31 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died and 364,000 recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Because of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen region restricted free movement and began border controls.
National responses included measures to contain the spread of the disease, including quarantine (known as stay-at-home order, shelter order or home quarantine) and military rule.As of April 2, around 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, were under some form of home quarantine in the United States; in the Philippines, more than 50 million people, around 59 million people in South Korea and 1.3 billion people in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were subjected to some form of quarantine, up two days later to 2.6 billion people – about a third of the world’s population.

On December 31, a public notice was issued by the Wuhan City Health Commission.
The World Health Organization was informed on the same day.
As the news broke, police warned Wuhan doctors about the “rhetorical spread” of the outbreak.
China's National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a major campaign titled “People’s War” to contain the spread of the virus, which was later described by Chinese Communist Party Secretary-General Xi Jinping.
In what is referred to as the "biggest quarantine in human history," a sanitary belt was identified on January 23 that blocked entry and exit from Wuhan, extending to a total of 15 cities in Hubei Province, affecting a total of about 57 million people.
The use of personal vehicles was prohibited in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were canceled in many places.
Officials also announced the construction of a temporary hospital called Huoshenshan Hospital, which will be completed within 10 days.
Later, another hospital, called Leichenshan Hospital, was built to handle more patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China also converted 14 other buildings in Wuhan, including convention centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals.

Public transport was reformed, and museums across China were temporarily closed.
Public commute controls were put in place in many cities, and it is estimated that about 760 million people (more than half the population) faced some kind of restriction on going out. In March, after the outbreak entered the global stage, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from "entering" from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international travellers entering the city.On March 23, only one case in mainland China was transferred to the country within the five days prior to that, by a traveler returning from Istanbul to Guangzhou.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the transmission of the disease has been substantially halted at home and the outbreak has been controlled in China.
On the same day, two months after the quarantine, travel restrictions were eased in Hubei, except for the city of Wuhan. On March 26, 2020, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced that entry for visa holders or residence permit holders would be suspended from March 28, 2020 and gave no details on when the implementation of the policy will end.
Those who want to enter China will have to apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.

On January 20, 2020, it was confirmed that COVID-19 had been transmitted through China to South Korea.
On February 20, the country’s health department reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, mainly related to a gathering in Daegu, which belonged to a new religious movement called the Church of Christ.
It was believed that Shincheonji disciples who came to Daegu from Wuhan were the source of the outbreak.
As of February 22, of the 9336 followers of the church, symptoms had been reported in 1,261, about 13% of them.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, rising to 3,150 on 29 February.

South Korea introduced a program for population screening and isolation, known as the world's largest and most organized program for population screening and isolation of all infected people, as well as tracking and quarantining those who have been in contact with them.
Screening methods include mandatory self-reporting of signals to newcomer international travelers via the mobile app, test centers that can be entered by car and the results are determined the next day, and increased testing capacity to 20,000 people per day.
The South Korean program, despite not lockdowning entire cities, is considered one of the most successful programs in controlling outbreaks. South Korean society was initially polarized in response to President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions to impeach Moon for what they called bad administration, and others praised his response.

A report from CNN found that combining the two factors of the large elderly population and the inability to test all people who have the virus to date could be effective at high mortality rates.
The UK’s response to the virus was one of the easiest among the countries affected, and by March 18, 2020, the UK government had not imposed any social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government faced criticism over the lack of speed and intensity in response to concerns faced by society.On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement recommending that all unnecessary travel and social contacts be canceled and suggested that people work from home if possible and avoid attending venues such as pubs, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the government announced that all recreational centers such as pubs and gyms should be closed as soon as possible, and pledged to pay 80% of the wages of workers up to <0xC2><0xA3>2,500 a month to avoid unemployment during the crisis.

Despite this, the U.S. had a slow start in testing people, which left the true extent of the outbreak obscure at the time.
Defective kits developed by the federal government, the failure to verify non-governmental testing kits (produced by universities, companies and hospitals) by the federal government until the end of February, and the restrictive criteria for individuals to qualify for testing by early March (after which a prescription was needed), disrupted the testing process in February.
The Washington Post reported that by February 27, fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.

The World Health Organization pointed to the conflict between the SARS outbreak in 2004-2002 and the current crisis, at which time Chinese authorities were accused of secrecy that hindered the success of efforts to prevent and contain the disease, but in the current crisis, the central government “provided new news on a regular basis so that there would be no panic on the eve of the Lunar New Year.”
On 23 January, Gauden Galea, WHO’s representative for the Emergencies, in response to the 2009 WHO’s decision to ban transport in Wuhan, declared the WHO’s WHO’s first-ever global health emergency, “While this decision is certainly not a matter of concern to the WHO’s recommendations,” it is a very important sign of a commitment to containing the pandemic in a place where the disease is most concentrated” and called “an unprecedented decision on human transmission since 30 January.”
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said the PHEIC was announced because of “the risk of a global outbreak, especially in low- and middle-income countries that lack a robust health system.”
In response to travel restrictions, Tedros said there was “no reason for measures that would unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade” and “the World Health Organization does not recommend restricting trade and movement.”
On February 5, the World Health Organization called on the international community to spend $675 million on strategic preparation, citing the need to support low-income countries “without systems to detect people who have the virus, even if symptoms appear.”
In addition, Tedros said in a statement that “we are only as strong as our weakest member” and urged the international community to “invest today or spend more later.”
On the same day, Tedros announced that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to allocate “the power of the entire UN system to combat the disease.”
As a result, a crisis management team was activated at the United Nations that coordinated all UN countermeasures, the World Health Organization said the team would allow them to “focus on the health fight against the disease while other organizations use their expertise to tackle the broader social, economic and developmental consequences of the outbreak.”
On February 14, a joint operations team led by the World Health Organization, in collaboration with China, was set up to help with the implementation of WHO experts and international experts in China, as well as the implementation of the WHO's "severe and contagious" phase of the global pandemic preparedness, which was to be done by hosting workshops and holding meetings with key institutions at the national level, another task of the team was to conduct field visits to assess the "impacting activities at the provincial and rural levels, including February."
In response to the growing spread of the disease in Iran, the World Health Organization sent a joint operational team to assess the situation.On 28 February, WHO officials announced that the global coronavirus threat assessment had increased from "high" levels to "very high", which is the highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the World Health Organization’s Health Emergency Program, warned in a statement that “this is a real test for all governments on the planet: Wake up.
The virus may be on its way and you need to be ready," he said, stressing that the right countermeasures can prevent “the worst of it” from happening in the world.
Ryan also said the current data did not persuade public health officials to declare the pandemic a global pandemic, stressing that the announcement "means that we have fundamentally accepted that every human on the planet is at risk of contracting the virus."
On March 11, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus pandemic.
The WHO director-general said that “the organization is deeply concerned, both by the alarming level of the outbreak and its severity and by the alarming level of inadequate action.”The World Health Organization faced many criticisms for its inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The negative reactions included a petition for the resignation of WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom, signed by 733,000 people as of April 6.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts emphasized respect for the rights of all people during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Experts emphasized that every individual, including persons with disabilities, minority groups, older people, internally displaced persons, people living in very bad conditions, people in detention, as well as refugees and other undisclosed groups in need of government support, has the right to health.
International government agencies are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has launched a platform to provide comprehensive and timely information on counter-policies in countries around the world, as well as to provide insights and recommendations.
The digital hub offers policies to strengthen the global health system and economy to counter the negative impacts of closures and travel restrictions, and includes partly to track countries' policies that aim to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a global confrontation aligned with the coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government has been criticised by the United States for its handling of the pandemic, which began in Hubei province of China, Secretary Michael Gove of the British Cabinet Office and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s son Eduardo Bolsonaro.
A number of provincial-level executives of the Communist Party of China (CPC) have been laid off due to mismanagement of quarantine in the central part of China, a sign of dissatisfaction with how the political institution dealt with the outbreak.
Some analysts believe the move aims to keep Chinese Communist Party Secretary Xi Jinping safe from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, including Zhao Lijian, have rejected their earlier confirmation that the coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan and have proposed a conspiracy theory that COVID-19 originated in the United States or Italy.
Donald Trump’s administration dubbed the coronavirus “Chinese virus” or “Wuhan virus” and declared that “China’s censorship has exacerbated the virus and turned it into a global pandemic,” the remarks, in turn, were criticized by some critics as racism and “actions to divert public opinion from its government’s failure to contain the disease.”
The Daily Beast obtained some U.S. government information describing a media trick that clearly originated with the National Security Council, calling the strategy "everything about China."
We were told to try and use every means possible, including press conferences and television appearances, to convey the message.”Media including Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that China’s efforts to send aid to countries where the virus has spread are part of the propaganda pressure to make a global impact.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that “there is a geopolitical component that involves an effort to influence through news turnaround and generosity policy.”
Borrell also said that “China wants to send a strong message that unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner.”
China also reportedly sent aid to Venezuela and Iran, urging the United States to lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran.
On April 3, U.S. sanctions blocked the arrival of 100,000 masks donated by Jack Ma to Cuba.
U.S. officials were also accused of transferring aid to other countries.
Differences over mask were also reported between countries such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey confiscated hundreds of ventilators on its way to Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the EU’s lack of solidarity with Italy, which had suffered many negative impacts from the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the EU, said only China responded.
This is certainly not a good sign for European solidarity.”
On March 22, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian military to send military medicine, disinfectant vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa reported, citing an anonymous “high-level political source,” that 80 percent of Russia’s aid “was useless or ineffective for Italy.”
The source accused Russia of starting a “geopolitical and diplomatic” showdown.
Attilio Fontana, head of Lombardy and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio, denied media reports and expressed their gratitude for the aid.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, “Putin believes that when U.S. producers are strengthened and moved, they will be able to retaliate if needed.”
NATO’s planned “Defender 2020” military exercises will be held in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, NATO’s largest since the end of the Cold War, on a more limited scale.
Kate Hudson, Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, criticized the 2020 Defenser exercises, saying, “In the current public health crisis, the exercises not only endanger the lives of U.S. soldiers and many participating European countries, but also the lives of residents of countries where the exercises are taking place.”
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders on March 14, 2020, stating that his country is struggling to combat the outbreak due to the lack of access to global markets as a result of U.S. sanctions against Iran. The outbreak has prompted calls for the U.S. to adopt social policies that are common in other rich countries. Some of these policies include public health care, universal health care, and child welfare.
Political analysts have predicted that the disease could negatively affect Donald Trump’s chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have worsened due to the pandemic.
After Japan announced that anyone coming to Japan from South Korea would be quarantined for two weeks in places designated by the government, South Korea criticized Japan's "obfusc and passive quarantine efforts."
South Korean society was initially polarized by President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions to impeach Moon for what they called bad governance, and others praised his response. The pandemic allowed countries to pass emergency legislation in response.
Some analysts have expressed concern that the disease could allow governments to hold on to more power.
Hungary’s parliament allowed Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to pass legislation indefinitely, suspend parliament and elections, as well as punish those who appear to have spread misinformation about the virus and how to manage the government’s crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been the main cause of several cases of resource scarcity due to the increased use of equipment to fight the outbreak, neuro-buying and disrupting logistics operations and factories.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about a shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to rising consumer demand and supplier disruption.
Several locations have also seen nerve-wracking purchases, which have resulted in shelves being emptied of essentials such as food, toilet paper and mineral water, and instilled a sense of scarcity of resources.
In particular, the tech industry has warned of delays in the transportation of electronic goods.
According to Tedros Adhanom, director-general of the World Health Organization, demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100-fold.
This demand has led to upwards of 20 times the normal price, delaying medical supplies for four to six months.
It has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, and the World Health Organization has warned that this would put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic has opened up a new opportunity for daigou buyers to sell Australian products to China.
This activity caused a shortage of milk in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region and the subsequent high demand for food, both areas have been freed from severe food shortages.
Measures taken by China and Italy have been successful in combating the speculation and illegal sale of essential products, preventing the severe food shortages predicted in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy has not experienced a severe shortage of agricultural products, but according to industry representatives, prices may rise.
Even in the city of Wuhan, it was only occasionally observed that the food shelves were empty, and Chinese government officials marketed pork stocks to ensure proper nutrition.
There are similar laws in Italy that require food producers to have reserves for such emergencies.
The damage to the global economy has been felt in China: according to media reports on March 16, the Chinese economy was hit hard in the first two months of 2020 due to government action to reduce the spread of the virus and a sharp decline in retail sales by 20.5%.
As mainland China is one of the world’s leading economies and manufacturing hubs, the outbreak of the virus poses a significant destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicts that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture of the possible consequences of the current situation is revealed.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the negative economic impacts of the pandemic on global growth could outweigh those of the SARS outbreak in 2004-2002.
A Washington University expert at St. Louis estimates a negative impact of more than $300 billion on the global supply chain that could take up to two years.
According to reports, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is “stamping” after oil prices fell sharply due to a drop in demand from China.
Global stock markets collapsed on February 24 due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On 27 February, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, various U.S. stock indexes, including NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, experienced their most severe fall since 2008, with the Dow index falling by 1,191 units, the highest drop in a single day since the 2008-08 economic crisis.
All three indicators ended the week with a drop of more than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China’s top credit rating but maintained its negative outlook.
Stock markets fell once again due to fears of the coronavirus, with the largest fall occurring on March 16.
Many believe that economic recession is possible.
Mohamed El-Erian, an economic expert, praised the timely and emergency measures of central banks and governments.
Central banks are reacting faster than in the 2008 financial crisis.
Due to the travel ban, the closure of public places, including travel attractions, and the advice of governments to avoid any travel around the world, tourism is one of the sectors most affected.
As a result, many airlines, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, have canceled flights due to reduced demand, and the UK-based regional airline Flybe has been shut down.
The negative impact of the virus on the cruise ship industry has been unprecedented so far.
Several train stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The pandemic coincided with Chunyun, which is one of the main travel seasons associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
A number of events, including large-scale New Year’s festivals, were cancelled by national or regional governments, and private companies, including Disneyland Hong Kong and Shanghai, also independently closed their stores and attractions.
Many Lunar New Year events and attractions, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple exhibitions, were closed to prevent mass gatherings.
In 24 of China’s 31 provinces, municipalities and districts, authorities extended the New Year’s holiday until February 10 and ordered most workplaces not to reopen on that date.
These regions accounted for 80% of GDP and 90% of the country’s exports.
Hong Kong raised infection levels to the highest level, declaring a state of emergency, shutting schools until March and canceling New Year celebrations.
Visits to retail stores in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Retail stores in North America and the Middle East saw a 60-50% drop in visits.
The outbreak also led to a 43-33% reduction in pedestrian traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
The operators of major shopping malls around the world took other measures, including increasing health care, installing temperature scanners to check buyers' body temperature, and cancelling events. According to the UN Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic could bring between 14 million and 22 million people in Latin America into extreme poverty, which would not have been possible without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the height of the pandemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people lost their jobs in China.
A large proportion of the population of around 300 million rural migrant workers were trapped in the internal provinces of their homes or in Hubei Province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
According to estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronavirus outbreak could damage 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could rise by up to 32%. The closures in India have resulted in the unemployment of tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (paid on a daily basis). A survey conducted by Angus Reid found that 44% of Canadian households had experienced some form of unemployment since the closure of their 90, and businesses in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a comprehensive credit scheme. Approximately half a million companies in Germany have sent their workers to short-term, government-subsidized work schemes known as Kurzarbeit.
Germany’s short-term compensation plan has also been implemented by France and Britain.
Performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have also been deeply affected by the pandemic, both operations and the human resources of the relevant organizations – both employed and independent – around the world.
Arts and culture organizations have been working to continue their mission (which is often funded by state funding) to ensure community access to cultural heritage, protect the safety of their employees, and protect artists when possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, theaters and other cultural institutions around the world, to varying degrees, were closed for unspecified periods, and their exhibitions, events and shows were canceled or postponed.
Instead, many efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another consequence of the disease, which has been accelerating rapidly lately, is the cancellation of religious ceremonies, major sporting events and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion fairs.
The film industry has also experienced difficulties. The Vatican announced that the Holy Week Ceremony in Rome, which takes place during the last week of the Christian fast and repentance season, has been canceled.
Many bishops have advised older Christians to stay at home instead of attending Sunday Mass; some churches have made church services available via radio, live streaming online, or television, while others have made it possible to attend car worship.
The Roman Catholic diocese has closed its churches and temples, St. Peter’s Square has been cleared of Christian pilgrims, other religious institutions have canceled their services, and have restricted public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and pyramids.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak, and the shrines were later closed, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims as well as residents from entering holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most disruption to the sporting calendar around the world since World War II.
Most major sporting events, including the European League 20-2019, the Premier League 20-2019, Euro 2020, the NBA 20-2019 season and the NHL 20-2019 season, have either been cancelled or postponed.
The outbreak made it difficult for the 2020 Summer Olympics to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be “again planned for a date beyond 2020, at most for the summer of 2021.”The casinos and other gaming centers around the world have been closed and live poker tournaments have either been canceled or postponed.
This has led many gamblers to visit online sites, many gambling sites have reported a significant increase in their enrollment rates. The entertainment industry has also been damaged, and many music groups have suspended or canceled their concert tours.
Many major theaters, including Broadway, have also suspended all shows.
Some artists have discovered ways to continue producing and sharing artwork over the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live streaming concerts or creating web-based “festivals” for artists to perform, distribute and promote their work.
In the online space, many memes have been spread with the theme of the coronavirus, so many of them come across humor and miscellaneous issues amidst existing uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been an increase in discrimination, xenophobia and racism towards Chinese people and the East Asian race, as well as people in disease centers in Europe, the United States and other countries.
In many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region, there have been instances of fear, suspicion and hostile behavior.
Reports from February (when most of the cases were still confined to China) show racist sentiment in various groups around the world about whether the Chinese people deserve the virus or are experiencing justifiable torment.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their regional origins.
Support has been provided to the Chinese people, both online and offline, from those in areas affected by the virus.
After the spread of the disease to other countries, the people of Italy, the first European country to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19, also became subject to suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea, in an effort to stop the spread of the disease, initially signed petitions to ban Chinese arrivals in their countries.
In Japan, the hashtag <0x23>ChineseDontComeToJapan was trending on Twitter.
Chinese nationals, as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States, reported an increase in the rate of racist insults and attacks against themselves.
U.S. President Donald Trump has been criticized for naming the coronavirus as a “Chinese virus,” the term being racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian nationals and foreigners evacuated from Wuhan and transported to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeastern India, who share a border with China and are studying in major cities, reportedly experienced harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, head of the state department of the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, declared that the Chinese had destroyed nature and that “God had avenged them for this reason.”
The remarks were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Calcutta and called "wrong."In China, the pandemic fueled xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents, and foreigners were called "foreign rubbish" and targeted "outsiders."
Many paid-subscription newspapers removed the subscription fee for all or part of the coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers made scientific papers related to the outbreak available for free.
Some scientists quickly shared their results on servers of pre-release versions such as bioRxiv.

Tests for the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 related respiratory disease include ways to detect the presence of the virus and antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of the virus in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronavirus' RNA.
This test is specific and only detects the SARS-CoV-2 RNA virus.
This test is used to confirm very new or active infections.
Antibodies (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population monitoring.
The antibody test shows how many people had the disease, including people who had very mild symptoms and did not report them or who did not have symptoms at all.
Using the results of this test, accurate disease mortality rates and collective immunity levels can be detected in the population.
Because of limited testing, as of March 2020, no country had reliable data on the incidence of the disease in its population.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and there are huge differences in the number of tests conducted between countries.
This difference is likely to significantly affect the reported case fatality rate, which is likely to be overestimated in some countries.
The test, which uses the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), can be performed on respiratory samples taken in a variety of ways, including nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum samples.
The results of this test are usually determined within a few hours to two days.
An RT-PCR test performed with a throat swab only gives reliable results in the first week of the disease.
After that, the virus can disappear from the throat while it is multiplying in the lungs.
For infected people who are tested in the second week, alternative samples can be taken with a suction catheter from the depths of the respiratory tract, or it is possible to use coughing substances.
One of the first PCR tests was developed in January 2020 at Charité in Berlin using instantaneous reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), forming the basis for the 250,000 test kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test method as of January 23, 2020.The South Korean company Kogenebiotech on January 28, 2020, developed a PCR-based clinical diagnostic kit for SARS-CoV-2 (PowerChek Coronavirus).
The kit follows the "E" gene that is common to all beta-coronaviruses and the RdRp gene that is specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, the BGI group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use of the diagnostic kit based on the SARS-CoV-2 virus PCR from the National Medical Products Organization of China.In the United States, the Rent-PC Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) are distributing the new coronavirus RT-PC panel at the moment.
One of the three genetic tests in previous versions of the test kit resulted in unspecified results due to faulty reagents and testing restrictions at the CDC in Atlanta, resulting in an average of less than 100 samples being processed successfully throughout February.
As of February 28, 2020, testing using two components was not reliable, followed by state and local laboratories being allowed to test.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization. US commercial laboratories began conducting the test in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced that RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing is now available nationwide.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 testing available nationwide as of March 9, 2020.
No limits were announced for the number of tests; sampling and processing should be done according to the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the production and development of the COVID-19 test kit was carried out by the National Center for Virology and Biotechnology Research VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Health Surveillance. On March 12, 2020, it was reported that the Mayo Clinic had developed a test for COVID-19. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be done within 3.5 hours in high volume, allowing a device to perform about 4,128 tests over a 24-hour period.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted emergency use authorization (EUA) for the m2000 system to Abbott Laboratories; the FDA had previously issued similar licenses for Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid similarly received an EUA authorization for a 45-minute trial.
The FDA has approved an experiment that uses isothermal nucleic acid enhancement instead of PCR.
Since this does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can deliver a positive result within just five minutes and a negative result within 13 minutes.
About 18,000 of these devices are currently available in the United States, and Abbott expects to be able to deliver 50,000 tests per day by boosting production. A test that uses a monoclonal antibody specifically bound to the new coronavirus’s nucleocapsid protein (protein N), is in development in Taiwan and hopes to deliver results within 15 to 20 minutes, just like a rapid flu test.
A review of the research conducted in March 2020 concluded that "radio images of the chest have little diagnostic value at an early stage, while findings of CT [computer tomography] can be identified even before symptoms appear."
Typical features in CT include multi-lobular opacity of matte glass with lateral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, subsexual dominance, faulty and tightened coverage occurs.
The research that compares PCR to CT in Wuhan, which is the origin of the current pandemic, suggests that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, and at the same time less specific because it overlaps many of the imaging features of CT with other inflammatory lung diseases and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that “CT should not be used as an initial screening or test to diagnose COVID-19.”As of March 2020, the CDC recommends a PCR procedure for initial screening.
Part of the immune system’s response to this infection is to produce antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to diagnose infection in people after 7 days or more of symptoms appearing, to detect immunity, and to monitor the population. This test can be done in central laboratories (CLT) or through testing in a patient's armpit (PoCT).
High-capacity automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on how much each system is produced.
For CLT, a sample of peripheral blood is usually used, although several consecutive samples may be used to track the immune system's response.
For PoCT, a sample of blood is usually taken by piercing the skin.
Unlike PCR methods, the extraction stage is not required prior to testing. On March 26, 2020, the FDA released a list of 29 entities that had notified the organization as requested and were therefore now able to distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorization. In late March 2020, the Euroimmun Medical Diagnostic Laboratory and Epitope Diagnostics obtained European approval for their test kits. These kits could detect IgG and IgA antibodies that were secreted against the virus and were present in the blood sample.
The testing capacity of several hundred samples within a few hours is therefore much faster than conventional PCR tests to detect the virus’ RNA.
These antibodies are usually detectable 14 days after the onset of the disease.In early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the antibody test kits it bought were adequately used.
Hong Kong implemented a plan to allow suspected patients to stay at home, "the emergency department will give the patient a sampling tube," the patient will spit his saliva into it and return it, and later receive the test result. The British NHS has announced that it is conducting a test with a precautionary measure to detect suspected cases at home, which would put others at risk of being infected if the patient went to the hospital, as well as if the ambulation was necessary.
Automotive testing centers have enabled South Korea to operate one of the fastest and most extensive testing methods compared to other countries. In Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Physicians announced on March 2 that it had a capacity of 12,000 tests per day on a mobile basis, with 10,700 being tested in the previous week.
If the test is ordered by a doctor, the costs will be paid by health insurance.
According to the head of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity to conduct 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, it has been possible to test cars in several major cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests conducted in Germany was unknown because only positive results were reported.
A laboratory questionnaire showed that up to the calendar week of 12/2020 GIU had a total of at least 483,295 samples processed by the end of the week of 12/2020, and the result was 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, the researchers of the Hospital Technion and Rambam have developed and tested a method for testing the samples of 64 patients simultaneously, they did this by combining the samples and then further tests.
The lab took five days to build and was monitored by BGI co-founder Wang Jian, whose modelling showed that if the test capacity was not put into operation, the number of cases in Wuhan would be 47% higher and the costs associated with quarantine would double.
Huo-Yan laboratories were immediately launched in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
As of March 4, 2020, the total daily capacity reached 500,000 tests per day. The open-source and composite designs published by Origami Tests can test samples from 1,122 patients using only 93 COVID-19 testing kits. These balanced designs are applicable in small laboratories without the need for a liquid robotics checker.
By March, deficiencies and a lack of sufficiently adequate reagents had become a barrier to mass testing in Europe, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This has led some authors to review sample preparation protocols that include heating samples up to 98<0xC2><0xB0>C (208<0xC2><0xB0>F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates is now testing a large number of its population for the coronavirus, which is more per capita than any other country, and in this regard, to achieve a large part of its population's success.
This is possible due to the capability to test with a car and the purchase of a large-scale laboratory of the country's entire population from Group 42 and BGI (based on the "Huo-Yan" emergency detection labs in China).
The lab, built in 14 days, is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day, making it the first of its kind to operate outside of China.
Various test recipes that target different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization used German guidelines to prepare and deliver kits to low-income countries that do not have the resources to manufacture domestic kits.
The German Test Kit Directive was released on January 17, 2020. Since the protocol developed by the US Centers for Disease Control was not available until January 28, it caused delays in starting testing in the United States. China and the United States had difficulty in assessing the reliability of test kits early in the outbreak, and these countries, along with Australia, were unable to provide enough kits to meet the demand and recommendations recommended by health professionals for testing.
In contrast, experts say the widespread availability of testing in South Korea has helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The testing capacity, mainly in private labs, has been built by the South Korean government over the years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for strengthening testing programs as the best way to slow the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing due to the spread of the virus has delayed hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States and scarce stocks of swabs and chemical reagents.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits produced by the CDC had a "failure". The government then removed bureaucratic barriers from conducting private experiments. Spain purchased test kits from Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the test results were not correct.
The company explained that the incorrect results may be a result of problems in collecting samples or using the kits incorrectly.
The Spanish minister said he would not use kits that provide incorrect results and replaced them with a different test kit developed by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic purchased from China yielded wrong results.Slovakia bought 1.2 million test kits from China, which gave the wrong results.
Prime Minister Matovi<0xC4><0x87> suggested that the kits be poured into the Danube River. At<0xC5><0x9F> Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said the test kits Turkey bought from China had a "high error rate" and did not "use them."The UK government bought 3.5 million test kits from China but announced in early April 2020 that the kits were not usable.
The test, followed by the quarantine of those who tested positive and the tracking of those who were associated with those with positive SARS-CoV-2 virus results, had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of V<0xC3><0xB2>, where the first COVID-19 death occurred in Italy, conducted two rounds of experiments within 10 days on a total population of about 3,400 people.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms and all positive cases were quarantined.
By limiting travel to public facilities, new infections were completely eradicated.
With the serious tracking of contacts, restrictions, testing and quarantine of incoming passengers, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore was much slower than in other developed countries, with no severe restrictions, such as forced closures of restaurants and retail outlets.
Many events have been canceled, and Singapore advised residents to stay home on March 28, but schools reopened on March 23 after the holidays.
Several other countries, including Iceland and South Korea, also managed the pandemic with serious tracking of contacts, restrictions, testing, and quarantine of incoming passengers, with fewer closures.
A statistical study has shown that countries that have had more tests than deaths have a much lower mortality rate, probably because these countries are better able to detect those with only mild symptoms or no symptoms.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that countries with no testing capacity and national labs with limited COVID-19 experience send the first five positive and ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the WHO’s 16 reference laboratories to be approved.
Of these 16 reference laboratories, seven are in Asia, five in Europe, two in Africa, one in North America and one in Australia.
In the chart below, the column “% positive for all tests” is affected by each country’s testing policy.
If all the other conditions were the same, the percentage of positive tests would be higher in a country that tests only people admitted to hospitals compared to a country that tests all citizens, whether they have symptoms or not.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning a person’s hand in order to remove dirt, fat, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap consistently throughout the day in “sensitive cases” prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through feces and mouths.
For example, if people don’t wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes), they may develop respiratory illnesses such as the flu or the cold.
Five important situations during the day where washing your hands with soap is important are: before and after going to the bathroom, after cleaning or changing diapers, before feeding your baby, before eating, and before and after preparing food or touching raw meat, fish or poultry.
Hands can be cleaned with ashes if water and soap are not available. The World Health Organization recommends handwashing in the following ways:
Before, during and after meals.
Before and after taking care of the patient.
After changing diapers or cleaning the baby after using the toilet.
After sneezing, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, animal waste or feeding animals.
Hand hygiene from a medical point of view refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before giving medication or medical care can prevent or minimize transmission of the disease.
Medically, the main purpose of hand washing is to clean hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other disease-causing microorganisms) and chemicals that can cause danger or disease.
This is especially important for people dealing with food or working in medical-related occupations, but also for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious agents of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
And reduce the rate of infant mortality during childbirth at home.
A 2013 study found that improvements in hand washing practices may lead to slight improvements in the height growth of children under the age of five.
In developing countries, the death rate from respiratory diseases and diarrhea in children can be reduced by promoting simple behavioral changes, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by almost 50%.
Measures that promote hand washing can reduce diarrhea cases by about a third, and this is comparable to providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% reduction in diarrhea cases can be linked to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap as an automatic behavior that has become a habit in homes, schools and communities around the world is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI).
Pneumonia, which is one of the major acute respiratory infections, is one of the leading causes of death in children under the age of five, causing about 1.8 million deaths each year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together cause approximately 3.5 million children to die each year.
According to UNICEF, turning washing hands with soap before meals and after using the toilet into a solid habit could save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, halving deaths from diarrhea by almost a quarter, and reducing deaths from acute respiratory infections.
Hand washing is usually integrated with other hygiene interventions as part of the Water, Hygiene and Hygiene (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also protects against the infection of the ulcer that is transmitted through direct body contact.
One of the harmful but small effects of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can lead to dry skin and result in damage to the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to skin itching, also known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among health care workers.
Excessive hand washing is also referred to as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
The five most important times during the day when washing your hands with soap is important to reduce fecal-oral transmission of the disease are: after going to the bathroom (stool, stool), after cleaning the baby (changing the diaper), before feeding the baby, before eating, and before and after preparing food or touching meat, fish, or raw chicken.
Other things that should be followed in that proper hand washing method in order to prevent disease transmission include before and after the treatment of cuts or wounds, after sneezing, coughing or firing; after touching animal waste or touching animals; and after contact with waste.
In many countries, hand washing with soap is very low.
A 2015 study of hand washing in 54 countries found that, on average, 38.7 percent of households have become accustomed to hand washing with soap. A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of hand washing with soap, 97 percent; the United States was in the middle of the class with 77 percent; and China was in the bottom of the class with 23 percent. There are now several ways to change behavior to increase the amount of hand washing with soap in critical times.
The basic health care program implemented by the Ministry of Education in the Philippines is an example of extensive measures to promote health and education in children.
Twice a year, decongestants combined with daily hand washing with soap, brushing your teeth daily with fluoride are the main focus of this national program.
In Indonesia, the program has also been successfully implemented.
Adding soap or detergent to water is effective in removing microorganisms from the skin.
The main function of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers of solubility and increase solubility.
Water alone is an inefficient cleanser for the skin because fats and proteins, which are part of organic soil, are not easily dissolved in water.
However, the flow of sufficient amount of water helps in cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies that have examined the transmission of bacteria from contaminated solid soap have concluded that it is unlikely to be transmitted this way because bacteria are washed with foam.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still believes that “liquid soap that is accessible without direct hand contact is better.”
Antibacterial soaps have been heavily promoted for people who care about hygiene.
To date, there is no evidence that antiseptic or antiseptic agents are effective in destroying antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial substances such as triclosan, which are resistant to a wide variety of organisms.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not meant to be destroyed with antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are advertised on the market.
Advanced formulations, in addition to surfactant and skin protection, may contain acid (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulator, antimicrobial-active benzoic acid and other skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamin, menthol, herbal extract). A comprehensive analysis of the School of Public Health of the University of Oregon showed that regular soap is as effective as antibacterial soap to prevent trilexane and hand disease.
Hot water used for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 <0xC2><0xB0> C).
However, hot water with soap is more effective than cold water with soap in removing natural oils that contain dirt and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water has no effect on reducing microbial load on the hands.
Hand sanitizer is a non-blue hygiene substance.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, water-based non-alcoholic hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol-based hand sanitizers or hand sanitizers) gained popularity.
Most of these are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol combined with a concentrated substance such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) and in gel form, or to ease use and reduce the alcohol-drying effect of a diluent such as glycerin and are made in the form of liquid or foam.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide increases most antimicrobial activity. Disinfectants containing at least 60 to 95 percent alcohol are effective killer microbes.
Alcohol-containing disinfectants kill bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, varicella, influenza and hepatitis), and fungi.
Antiseptics containing 70% alcohol, 30 seconds after use, cause 99.97% loss (3.5 lb., equivalent to 35 db) of hand bacteria and 1 minute after use, 99.99% to 99.999% (lower 4 to 5 lb) of hand bacteria. Hand disinfectants are less effective against bacteria, but less effective against viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective against the norovirus (or Norwalk) variant, which is the most common cause of contagious gastrointestinal disease. A sufficient amount of hand sanitizer or alcohol-containing gel should be used to keep both hands completely wet or covered.
The back and side of both hands and between and the ends of all fingers should be rubbed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel is dried.
Fingertips should also be washed well by rubbing on the palms of both hands. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing more than hand sanitizer, especially when the hands are completely dirty.
The increasing use of these materials is due to their ease of use and their ability to quickly eliminate microorganisms; however, they should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing unless soap and water are available.
Repeated use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless softeners or skin moisturizers are added to their formulations.
Adding glycerin or other softeners to their formula can reduce or eliminate the dehydration effect of alcohol.
In clinical trials, hand sanitizers containing alcohol and softening agents produced much less irritation and dry skin than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact hives syndrome or alcohol allergy or additives found in alcohol-containing hand sanitizers are rare.
The lower chance of developing contact dermatitis compared to hand washing with soap and water made them more attractive.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water-based materials do not clean hands from organic materials, but disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many diseases, as pathogens still remain on the hands.
The effect of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is heavily dependent on their ingredients and formulations, and has historically been less effective than alcohol-containing hand sanitizers.
Recently, formulations that use benzalconium chloride have been shown to have more cumulative and persistent antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, which decreases after repeated use, possibly due to negative skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities can’t afford soap and instead use ashes or soil.
Ash or soil may be more effective than water alone, but may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ashes are contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the spread of the disease, rather than slowing the spread.
Like soap, ash is a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution in contact with water.
In the absence of soap, the World Health Organization recommends ash or sand as a substitute for soap.
The correct hand-washing method recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with hot or cold running water.
Current water is recommended because stagnant water may be contaminated. This is while the water temperature does not seem to change at all.
Apply enough soap and soap on your hands, including the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap kills germs on the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than when using only water.
Rub your hands together for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing hands creates friction and helps remove germs from the skin, and rubbing hands for longer periods of time eliminates more germs.
Wash your hands with warm water.
Washing in stagnant water can re-infect your hand.
Dry with a clean towel or let it dry in the air.
Wet, wet hands can be easily infected. Most of the parts of the hand that remain sitting are thumbs, wrists, areas between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and dislocated nails may be a hiding place for microorganisms.
Moisturizing creams are often recommended to prevent dry hands. Dry skin leads to skin damage and can increase the risk of infection transmission.
There are various low-cost options to facilitate handwashing in developing countries when there is no running water or soap available. For example, pouring water from a gallon or hole-dipped container or using ash if necessary. In situations where water resources are limited (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "tap taps or small taps" and other low-cost options.
Tap Tap is a simple technology that is made from a container hung by a rope and a controllable lever by the foot to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a soap mold.
Effective hand drying is an important part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective form of hand drying in public bathrooms.
A growing body of research shows that paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study sponsored by the paper towel industry, the European Textiles Symposium by the University of Westminster in London, compared the hygiene of paper towels, hot air dryers and more modern jet air dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria at the fingertips increased by an average of 194% and the bacteria in the palms of the hands increased by 254%.
Drying hands with an air jet dryer resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria in the fingertips by 42% and in the palms of the hands by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with paper towels, the total number of bacteria in the palms of the hands decreased by an average of 76% and in the palms of the hands by 77%.
The air jet dryer, which claims to blow air out at 180 mph (650 km or 400 mph), is capable of blowing microorganisms from hands and devices and potentially infecting other people using the bathroom as well as the bathroom environment up to a distance of 2 meters.
Using a hot air dryer, it can disperse microorganisms up to a distance of 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper towels did not cause a significant release of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by T<0xC3><0x9C>V Product und Umwelt, various hand drying methods were investigated.
The following changes were observed in a number of bacteria after drying hands:
There are a large number of manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers are compared with paper towels.
If soap and water are not available during travel, hand washing using hand sanitizer can be used as an alternative method.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Not long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis recognized the effectiveness of hand washing (in 1846) in preventing disease in a hospital setting, medical hand washing became compulsory.
There are electronic devices that can remind people if hospital staff have forgotten to wash their hands.
One study found that the rate of infection was reduced with their use.
The time required to wash your hands is at least 15 seconds, using a sufficient amount of soap and water or gel and rubbing all parts of the hand.
The hands should be rubbed together and the fingers folded together.
If there is pus under the nails, a brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs may remain in the water on the hands, it is important that the hands are well drawn and dried with a clean towel.
After drying the hand, a paper towel should be used to close the water tap (and, if necessary, to open the exit door).
This prevents reinfection of the hands from contacting those surfaces.
The goal of hand washing in medical centers is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("microbials") and prevent them from being transmitted.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that lack of hand washing in most hospital settings is unacceptable, with a large number of doctors and nurses usually forget to wash their hands before they come into contact with patients, resulting in the transfer of microorganisms.
One study found that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the amount of blood flow contaminants that cater to up to 66%.The World Health Organization has published a paper showing the standard hand washing method and rubbing hands together in health care.
The hand sanitizer manual drafted by the organization is also available to the public on its website.
A related review was conducted by Whitby and colleagues.
If required to prove compliance with the regulations, commercial devices can measure and confirm the level of hand hygiene.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has defined five “times” for washing hands:
After exposure to blood/body fluids
prior to doing any work related to disinfection, and
After patient care. Adding disinfectant chemicals to soap ("pharmaceutical" or "antimicrobial" soaps) strengthens the lethality of the hand washing agent.
Such measures may be considered before surgery or in an environment where antibiotic-resistant organisms are very prevalent. To wash hands before surgery, it is necessary to have the following: tap water that can be opened and closed without direct contact, some chlorhexidine or iodine, sterilized towels for drying hands after washing and sterilized to clean other nails.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires hand and forearm to be washed up to the elbow for usually 2-6 minutes.
Long washing (10 minutes) is not required.
When water is poured into your hands, the water will return to your hands.
After finishing hand washing, the hands are dried with sterile fabric and the surgical garment is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it’s best to wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before and after the patient’s care.
To control staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it has been found that most of the benefits of hand cleaning come from the first 20% of washing, and when the frequency of hand cleaning reaches more than 35%, there are very few additional benefits.
Hand washing with regular soap is three times more likely to transmit bacterial infectious diseases to food than antibacterial soap. Compared with alcohol-based soap, hand washing with antibacterial soap for 30 seconds showed that hand washing with alcohol reduced bacterial contamination by 26% compared with antibacterial soap.
But using soap and water is more effective than hand washing with alcohol-based materials in reducing the H1N1 influenza virus and Clusterdidium diphthyle than hands. Measures to improve hand hygiene in health centers can include training employees to wash their hands, increasing access to alcohol-based detergents, and providing written and oral reminders to employees.
More research is needed to determine which of these measures is most effective in different health care settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered a cost-effective and essential tool for achieving good health and even proper nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water, soaps, or hand-washing devices in homes, schools, and workplaces challenges the achievement of universal hand-washing practices.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, taps are scarce for hand-washing near private or public toilets, although there are cheaper options to build hand-washing stations.
However, the low rate of hand washing is mostly not due to the lack of soap or water, but can be the result of our bad habits.
Promotion of hand washing with soap can influence selective policies, raise awareness about the benefits of hand washing, and lead to long-term behavioral change at the community level.
Monitoring and evaluation are necessary to ensure this is effective.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective in increasing handwashing rates in low- and middle-income countries, while social advertising campaigns are less effective. One example to promote hand washing in schools is the "Three Star Approach" by UNICEF, which encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap while meeting other health requirements.
By following minimum standards, schools can eventually be upgraded from one star to three.
The construction of hand washing stations can be part of the promotional handwashing efforts aimed at reducing disease and death in children.
World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness programs aimed at changing people’s behavior. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the use of handwashing emojis.
A small number of studies, in general, rejected the cost-effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in relation to the number of years lost due to disability.
However, one review suggests that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more economical than other measures.
For the first time, the importance of hand washing for human health – especially for people in vulnerable situations such as newborn mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals – was highlighted in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician, Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and the English Florence Nightingale who was the “founder of modern nursing”.
At the time, most people believed that infections were caused by an unpleasant odor called myasma.
In the 1980s, the prevalence of food-related diseases and health-related infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to broadly promote hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to increased awareness in many countries about the importance of hand washing with soap to protect yourself from infectious diseases.
For example, posters titled "correct hand washing methods" were installed next to handwashing sinks in public toilets and toilets in German office buildings and airports.
The phrase “washing someone’s hands” means declaring a person’s unwillingness to take responsibility for or share something.
The term is borrowed from the Bible of Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Christ, but the term is now used in some English communities with a much wider application.
In Shakespeare’s Macbeth, Ms. Macbeth washes her hands compulsively in an attempt to erase an imaginary stain, reflecting her guilty conscience for the crimes she committed and persuading her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people tend to wash their hands more often after remembering or contemplating unmoral actions, and they tend to wash their hands more often than others.
In addition, people who are allowed to wash their hands after such deliberation are less likely to participate in other “cleaning” compensation measures, such as volunteer work.
Religions recommend handwashing for hygiene purposes. Symbolic hand washing and using water and not soap to wash hands are part of the hand washing ritual, which is exhibited in many religions including Bahá’ís, Hinduism, Tuileh, and Netilat Yadhim in Judaism, the Wadhu Basin in Christianity and Wadsa in Islam. Religions also recommend handwashing after certain activities.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam dictate washing hands after using the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam recommend washing hands before and after each meal.
Control the risks associated with COVID-19 in the workplace.
Controlling the risks associated with COVID-19 in the workplace means using safe health practices to control the risks in order to prevent the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper control of workplace hazards depends on the workplace and the type of job, and should be based on the assessment of risk sources, the severity of the disease in the community, and risk factors for employees who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), less-risk occupations have less job contact with ordinary people and other coworkers, and basic measures are recommended to prevent infections, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, and maintaining daily cleanliness and disinfection of the workplace.
Medium-risk occupations include those in which employees require frequent or close contact with people who are not or are not suspected of contracting COVID-19, but may be infected due to the ongoing spread of the virus in the community or due to international travel.
This includes those who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, in high-density workplaces, and in some high-volume retailers.
Risk control for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, includes air conditioning through high-efficiency air filters, sneezing protection, and personal protective equipment in case of exposure to a person with COVID-19.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) considers health care workers who are exposed to people with or suspected of contracting COVID-19 to be at high risk, including those who are at high risk. If employees are doing work that results in the production of airborne particles or collecting, transporting or handling samples from people with or suspected of contracting COVID-19, they are at very high risk.
The right approach to risk control for these individuals includes engineering controls, such as creating negative pressure ventilation rooms and using personal protective equipment tailored to the task at hand.
The spread of COVID-19 can have different effects on the workplace.
Employees may not be at work because of illness, need to care for others, or fear of possible exposure.
Trading patterns may change, both in terms of what goods are needed and how they are accessed (e.g., shopping in non-crowded hours or shopping through home delivery services or car shopping).
Finally, the shipment of items from geographic areas most severely affected by COVID-19 can be halted. The necessary preparations and plans to respond to infectious diseases can be used to guide protective measures.
These programs examine the level of risk associated with various workplace and occupational tasks, including sources of exposure to disease, home and community risk factors, and individual risk factors for employees, such as aging or chronic illness.
It also outlines the necessary control measures to address those risks, as well as possible plans to deal with situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Preparation and plans for response to infectious diseases may be subject to national or local recommendations.
The goals of response to the outbreak include reducing disease transmission between employees, protecting those most exposed to health-related side effects, maintaining business activities, and minimizing negative impacts on other entities in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the areas where business activities take place affects the decisions made.
The hierarchy of risk control includes a framework that is widely used in occupational health and safety, through which control of hazards can be categorized according to their effectiveness.
In cases where it is not possible to eliminate the risks of COVID-19, the most effective controls are engineering controls followed by administrative controls and, ultimately, personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls require keeping employees away from work hazards without relying on employee behavior and can be the most cost-effective solution.
The administrative control method involves changes in the policy or method of work implemented by the employee or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is less efficient than engineering and administrative control methods, but can partially prevent exposure to the virus.
All types of PPEs should be selected based on the risk to employees, properly installed (e.g., respiratory tract), worn continuously and correctly, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced if necessary, properly removed, cleaned, and properly maintained or discarded to prevent contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), less-risk jobs have less job contact with ordinary people and their colleagues.
The basic measures recommended to prevent infection in all workplaces include hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, observing respiratory rituals such as covering their mouth and nose while coughing and sneezing, preparing handkerchiefs and trash cans, preparing for remote work or alternating shifts if necessary, encouraging employees to avoid using other people’s tools and equipment, and cleaning and disinfecting the work environment regularly.
Identifying and isolating potentially infected people is an important step in protecting employees, customers, visitors, and other people in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with acute respiratory symptoms should stay at home for at least 24 hours without using fever-reducing or other symptom-altering medications, fever, fever, and other symptoms, and that leave policies should be flexible, allowing employees to stay at home to take care of sick family members and employees to be aware of these policies.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), medium-risk occupations include occupations in which employees need to have frequent or close contact less than six feet (1.8 metres) with people who are not or are not suspected of contracting COVID-19, but may be infected due to the ongoing spread of the virus at the community level or due to international travel in areas where COVID-19 is widespread, SARS-2.
These include employees who are in contact with the general public, such as in places such as schools, workplaces, utilities, utilities, utilities, utilities, utilities, utilities, utilities, utilities, utilities, utilities, utilities, utilities, utilities, utilities, utilities, utilities, utilities, etc.
Employees in this risk group rarely need to use a respiratory tract.
If a person becomes ill on board the aircraft, appropriate procedures to protect the personnel and other passengers may include separating the sick person from others at a distance of 6 feet, assigning only one crew member to serve the patient and providing the patient with a face mask, or asking the patient to cover his mouth and nose when he coughs or sneezes.
The crew should wear disposable medical gloves when taking care of a sick passenger or when in contact with contaminated body fluids or surfaces, and should use additional personal protective equipment if the patient has a fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be thrown into a bio-danger bag, and contaminated surfaces should then be cleaned and disinfected. For commercial transportation, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, controlling the risks includes postponing disease travel, individual quarantine, and, in the event of fever or other symptoms, notifying the medical centre within the ship.
Ideally, medical follow-up should be done in the cabin of the quarantined person. For schools and childcare centers, if the infected person entered the school building regardless of the outbreak in the community, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends short-term closure for cleaning or disinfection.
If there is a small or medium-sized community transmission, the following measures can be implemented in the context of social distancing: canceling academic activities, gatherings and other large gatherings, such as physical or choir classes or dining in cafeterias, increasing the distance between tables, spacing between arrival and departure times, limiting non-essential visitors and separating use of health facilities for children with flu symptoms.
When there is a significant risk of disease transmission in the community, in addition to social distancing procedures, long school closures should be considered. For law enforcement personnel carrying out their daily activities, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers their immediate health risk to be low.
Law enforcement officers who need to be in touch with people who are infected or suspected of contracting COVID-19 are advised to follow the instructions that emergency medical technicians follow, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
In case of close contact at the time of arrest, employees should clean and disinfect their belts and belongings before reuse using a household cleaning spray or handkerchief, while also following standard procedures for the use and disposal of personal protective equipment (PPE) and washing clothes.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) considers health care workers to be at high risk.
High-risk occupations include healthcare, support, laboratory, and medical transport workers who have been exposed to people with or suspected COVID-19.
Employees whose work results in the production of airborne particles, or who collect, move or handle samples from people with or suspected of contracting COVID-19, are at a very high risk.
Works leading to the production of airborne particles include intubation, cough induction, bronchoscopy, and some dental procedures or invasive sampling of the patient.
High-risk occupations include employees preparing the bodies of people who were infected or suspected of contracting COVID-19 at the time of death. If the autopsy is performed, the risk level is very high. Additional engineering control methods for this group include the creation of separate rooms for patients who are infected or suspected of contracting COVID-19, including when doing things that lead to the production of aerosol particles.
Negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate for some health centers.
Patient samples should be treated with level 3 biometric precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who are new to COVID-19 be kept in a separate waiting room. In addition to the use of other personal protective devices, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recommends the use of respiratory tract for those who work within the 6-foot range of patients who are suspected of contracting COVID-19, as well as for those who do things that lead to the production of airborne particles.
In the United States, use an N95 respirator filter approved by NIOSH, according to the provisions of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program that includes appropriate tests, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory tracts can provide greater protection and make it easier for employees to use. The World Health Organization does not recommend using full-body coverage because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is not transmitted through body fluids.
The World Health Organization recommends only surgical masks to screen people at entry points.
The World Health Organization recommends guns and gloves for people who collect samples of the respiratory system of patients or take care of or carry COVID-19 patients and do not do anything that results in the production of airborne particles.
In the event that a particulate matter is produced in the air, the surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Considering that the global supply of personal protective equipment is insufficient, the World Health Organization recommends the following to minimize the need for personal protective equipment: conducting in-person medical examinations, establishing physical barriers such as installing transparent windows, allowing room access only to people who are not directly involved in the care of the COVID-19 patient, using personal protective equipment only to perform certain tasks, to use a respirator when taking care of multiple patients who are ill.

This month we see ourselves in remarkable circumstances.
The COVID-19 pandemic is something that clearly clarifies the universal continuity of humans and our responsibilities to each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented to us, but we know that our best response depends on the empathy, cooperation and community building at the heart of the organization.
The camaraderie and level of care we’ve seen among our colleagues through email, call, and chat shows incredible people that we have the chance and the honor to work alongside.
I am very grateful and proud to have you all as my colleagues.
Last week, someone appreciated what we did.
They reminded me how meaningful it was that the world could now go to Wikipedia, and what a powerful sign that this important resource could be available online to everyone.
Your work makes it possible, whether you keep the sites up-to-date or our partners get paid or our communities are safe.
Now more than ever, the world needs the information that Wikipedia provides.
This is a moment in which not only what we do but how we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make significant adjustments to the way we do our joint work from the beginning of next week.
Amendments to our work and programs
As Robin noted earlier, the team-c met last night to discuss our approach and plan for the coming days and months.
“During that conversation, we made a decision that we thought was the right answer to what we’re facing and the best way to sustain the organization during that time.
We wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to cut, that’s okay.
To all employees, contractors and contractors:
Until further notice, we expect to work 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week.
We’re not declaring a shutdown – if you can work more normal hours, you’ll be worth the mission.
However, the world is unpredictable right now, and no matter if you’re taking care of your loved ones, buying food, or visiting a doctor, your health is our top priority.
We do not track your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
It should go without saying, but we say that.
You don’t need to take sick leave or personal leave – just tell your manager and help your team review calendars and schedules and make sure someone is covering key tasks.
(If your COVID-19 test result has been positive, please inform Bryan of the T&C section so that T&C can help you and make sure your condition is properly managed.)
Employees who work hours are paid in full.
As we have said before, we are committed to our commitments to contractors and partners who work on an hourly basis.
All wages are paid on the basis of normal working hours under normal conditions.
This includes you even if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to relieve their stress to the world around us.
What we do, especially in such situations, can be very valuable.
Again, this is about your self-care.
We ask that you communicate with your manager so that we know what to expect and we can plan accordingly.
Some things are considered essential.
There are resources we need to do them.
SRE, HR Ops teams, trust and safety, and fundraising (and some others) are doing basic and important work that may require more support.
We will start a process with other departments to assess our current goals and focus on supporting what is essential to our mission.
There's a lot of work for all of us, we'll all focus on the most basic projects.
If we slow the process down now, we won’t get hurt later.
We don’t have a plan to work twice as hard as we do now as soon as the pandemic is over.
You are not expected to work extra hours to meet deadlines that are now impossible.
We accept that circumstances have changed and will work to set new goals and timelines if necessary.
How is the APP (Annual Planning)?
To match the new realities and expectations of the daily working hours, we plan to adjust the delivery timeline for our 2021-2020 annual schedule.
Our goal is to propose an extension of the 2020-2019 program, which will give us more time to budget and allow employees to prioritize critical work, self-care, and caring for their loved ones, while also allowing those who need or want to work fewer hours over the next few weeks.
This extension of the schedule greatly reduces the pressure of current work schedules throughout the organization.
We will submit our proposal to the board next week, and as soon as it is approved, we will notify delegates and teams in the next steps.
Thanks to the annual planning team for leading this work.
Office status, disease exposure and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, for further caution, we recruited an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces at the San Francisco office.
They used a hospital-grade anti-virus solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as for the lobby and elevators that lead to our floor.
The building uses its own surveillance protocol and uses products that are good for the health of its residents.
We are confident that the office will be well-prepared when we decide to return.
Our Washington office is located in a WeWork and they have shared their COVID-19 protocol with us and all employees based in DC.
According to the San Francisco State Guidelines, since last week, our Washington DC office has become a completely remote collection.
As some of our New York-based colleagues know, we’ve also talked about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions will continue, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Old colleagues who work remotely with us know that this can be an adaptation to the situation and want to give you some advice:
Limit the sessions to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, check how they can be held over the course of a few days.
Define the meeting clearly, have an agenda, and submit the materials for the study in advance.
Set up video with tools like Google Docs and Zoom by default so you can facilitate collaboration and live communication.
Determine someone in charge of leading the meeting, someone in charge of monitoring the chat to keep track of questions and lists of speakers, and someone to take notes (or joint notes).
If you need a comfortable headphone, send an email to the technical support team.
Use your health allowance for snacking.
Join the <0x23>remoties channel on Slack to discuss shared work with your colleagues.
The Human Resource Operations team is looking for webinar-based ergonomics guidance to support increased work across the foundation.
Last week, we asked all recipients of funding at the foundation’s level, such as editathon, to cancel the Wikimedia-funded public events until the World Health Organization announced the end of the pandemic.
We inform them that we know that our request to cancel plans and other restrictions can make it impossible to perform the agreed-upon activities related to receiving financial privileges and that no one will be punished for delaying or modifying their goals.
Next week, we will provide more guidelines on Wikimania and other topical and regional social events.
It seems that the general feeling across the global community is both distressing because of these disorders and at the same time a sense of relief because of their transparency and ability to focus on the activities of their own communities, Wikimedia, etc.
As we move forward, the CRT is trying to create a page in Meta-Wiki to give the community a space to monitor the impact and maintain our relationships with them.
Staying in touch with COVID-19 related issues
We will send a meeting invitation to your calendars for next Thursday, 14:00 UTC with 07:00 PT.
We will use this time to provide you with more and more new information, answer your questions, and spend some time communicating with each other.
We’re all in this together, and we’re here to help you in every way possible.
In the meantime, you can find information related to COVID-19 through this email and other information related to COVID-19 in the Office Wiki.
The CRT updates these pages and keeps all the information in one place.
We also strive to maintain regular contact with those of our employees who live in countries that are already significantly affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, mainstream work, or news coverage challenges, or anything else you may need help with, please do not hesitate to contact the CRT.
We are here to help and support you if necessary.
If you want to discuss a confidential or sensitive topic, please email Bryan Judean - International Human Resources Operations Manager.
None of these changes should be construed as abandoning our work and commitments.
Rather, it shows that at this moment our work and commitments probably need to adapt to a way we haven’t had in the past.
These are the steps that we believe are necessary to support each other so that we can continue to work and support our movement and provide the services that the world relies on.
What we plan to do when the time comes will be waiting for us.
Now is the time to support each other and create space for important work to be done in the weeks and possibly months ahead.
We need all of you to realize this, so we ask you to take care of yourself and your families so that you can be at your best when the need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and don’t touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan, and Toby N).
b'enzyme converting angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that adheres to the outer surface (cell membrane) of lung cells, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 disrupts the activity of the enzyme associated with the angiotensin-II transducer (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang(1-7), which makes it a promising drug target for treating cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also acts as a cell entry point for some coronaviruses.
The human version of this enzyme is often called hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a type of zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
ACE2 protein contains a range of N-terminal peptidase M2 and a range carrying C-terminal collectrin renal amino acids.
ACE2 is a single-membrane protein of type I whose enzymatic activity range is located near the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular amplitude of ACE2, along with another enzyme called shadaz, is isolated from the transdermal amplitude, and the resulting soluble protein is eventually excreted by urine once it enters the bloodstream.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 attaches to the cell membranes of type II bubble cells, mainly lung cells, small intestine enterocytes, endothelia and venous endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells of most organs.
Signs of ACE2 mRNA are found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a neutralizer of ACE.
ACE converts the hormone angiotensin I into angiotensin-tensing vessel II.
ACE2 in turn separates phenylalanine amino acid carboxyl-terminal from angiotensinII (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes to angiotensin-receptor (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-O).
ACE2 can break down a number of other peptides, such as [des-Arg9]-bradykine, aplin, neurotensin, dynorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the flow of the membrane carrying the neutral amino acid SLC6A19 and plays a role in causing Hartnap disease.
ACE2, as a transcranial protein, plays the role of the main point of entry into the cell for some coronaviruses such as HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the SARS-causing virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (the COVID-19-causing virus).
More importantly, the S1 spike protein binds the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 viruses to the enzymatic domain of ACE2 on the surface of the cells, leading to the intracellularity and displacement of the virus and enzymes in the endosomes within the cells.
This entry process requires the preparation of S protein by the host TMPRSS2 serine protease, whose inhibition is being investigated in the current research process as a possible treatment. It is hypothesized that reducing ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, several professional communities and regulatory bodies have suggested that treatment with standard ACE and ARB inhibitors should continue.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that “the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in pneumonia risk compared to controls.”
Meanwhile, “the risk of pneumonia was reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were more likely to develop pneumonia, especially those who had suffered a stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was linked to a reduction in pneumonia-related deaths, although the results were poorer compared to the overall risk of pneumonia.”
Human relapsed ACE (rhACE2) is thought to be a new treatment for acute pulmonary injury and appears to improve respiratory hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory dysfunction caused by lipopolysaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the start of action is 30 minutes plus the duration of the effect (duration) is 24 hours.
Some findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for people with systemic and classic renin-angiotensin inhibitors (RSA inhibitors) or angiotensin II-enhancing circulatory diseases. The effect of rhACE2 injections in clinical trials has been assessed to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome.
b'Covid-19 applications are mobile software applications used to intercept calls during the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, the process of identifying people (communications) who may have come into contact with an infected person.
Numerous programs have been developed or proposed to be supported by government officials in some territories and regions.
Several frameworks have been developed to prepare contact tracing programs.
Privacy issues have been raised, especially in systems based on tracking the geographic location of users of the application.
Less intrusive solutions include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would include support for Bluetooth-centric apps directly on Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay, has developed a program to help citizens find out if they have had contact with people with COVID-19.
The program is used in more than 200 cities in China. In Singapore, a program called TraceTogether is used.
The app has been developed by the local IT community, is open sourced and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has released the Bluetooth-centric app called “StopKorona!” to intercept possible contact with infected people and provide immediate response to the health authorities.
The program was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app has been waiting for approval from Google’s Play Store and Apple’s App Store.
On April 12, the government announced that the call-tracking program is in an advanced stage of development and will be ready for deployment within a few weeks. A similar program ("StopCovid") will be implemented in Ireland and France.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering plans based on TraceTogether and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia plans to introduce a geolocation program for COVID-19 patients and residents of Moscow to prevent these people from leaving their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, pointed to a number of functional problems related to program-centric systems, including false positive results and possible inefficiencies if the program is used in small population samples.
By examining the problems associated with the spread of misleading or harmful coronavirus apps, Apple has imposed restrictions on the type of organizations that are allowed to add coronavirus apps to the App Store and only allow “official” or reputable organizations to do so.
Google and Amazon have imposed similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have expressed concern about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, and have specifically stated that it is not clear whether the surveillance infrastructure created for the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled once the threat is resolved.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the restriction of this type of surveillance.
These organizations have outlined eight conditions for government initiatives:
Monitoring must be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
Monitoring and monitoring extensions shall have clauses with the possibility of automatic cancellation;
The use of data should be limited to COVID-19-related cases;
Data security and anonymity must be ensured and protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should not exacerbate discrimination and isolation;
The transfer of data to third parties must be within the framework of the law;
Guarantees should be considered for the prevention of abuse and the right of citizens to complain of abuse;
Targeted participation of all “relevant stakeholders” including public health experts and marginalized groups is essential. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporter Ohne Grenzen (RSF) have also published lists.
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to address the problem of continuous monitoring by removing the tracking mechanism from their operating systems once it has been addressed.
In some countries, instead of a program, the network-centric location process has been used, and as a result, the need to download the program and the ability to escape interception has disappeared.
In Israel, network-based interception has been approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw spatial data may violate privacy.
However, not all central server systems require access to personal location data; a number of privacy systems use central servers only for internal communications (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-program system was used to intercept calls.
Instead of using a specialized program, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and used it to inform potentially infected people via SMS.
In addition to using this information to communicate with potential audiences, the government also makes location information available to the public. This type of disclosure is authorized due to the widespread changes in data protection laws due to the outbreak of MERS in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of apps and websites. Some countries, such as Germany, have considered the use of centralized and privacy-preserving systems.
As of April 6, 2020, these details have not yet been disclosed.
Privacy tracking is an accepted concept that dates back to at least 2013.As of April 7, 2020, dozens of expert groups have been working on privacy-preserving solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that embraces centralized and decentralized approaches and is not an independent protocol. From decentralized protocols, it can be referred to as “Decentralized Close Surveillance with Privacy” (DP-PPT/DP-3T), “Provisional Call Numbers” (TCN, known as call event numbers, CEN), “Mobile Contact Sensitive Protocols” and “PATrators.”
In these protocols, personally identifiable data is never removed from the device, and all matching cases occur within the device.
The Privacy Group at the MIT Media Lab has been developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy-preserving practices in the process of collecting and consuming location and routing data, to track the spread of COVID-19.
The platform is based on the results of the research published in the official report “Apps: Privacy in the Age of the Pandemic” published in March 2020. Another similar initiative is Enigma MPC’s SafeTrace platform. The company is developing privacy technologies developed at MIT Media Lab.
With secure hardware technologies, SafeTrace allows users to share sensitive location and hygienic data to other users and authorities without violating data privacy.
On April 5, 2020, the TCN Global Coalition was formed by a number of groups. These groups had gathered to focus on what were essentially similar and largely overlapping protocols, with the aim of reducing the dispersion and providing a context for global cooperation in the field of surveillance and alarm programs, key aspects of achieving widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had made the BlueTrace protocol available to the public, which was used in its official government program.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies controlling mobile platforms Android and iOS, unveiled a call-tracking initiative that they claim is intended to protect privacy. The initiative is based on a combination of “low-energy Bluetooth” technology and privacy encryption.
They have also published the main technologies used in this system.
According to Apple and Google, the system will be launched in three phases:
Introducing Governments Empowerment Tools for Creating Privacy-Friendly Coronavirus Tracking Programs
Direct integration of this feature in iOS and Android. Google and Apple intend to address the problems of continuous adoption and monitoring by distributing the system through an operating system update and then removing it in a similar way after the threat has been removed.
Substitution of a drug (known as changing the application, changing the profile, changing the task, or moving the drug therapeutically) refers to changing the use of a drug approved for the treatment of a disease or a physical problem different from that for which the drug was originally developed.
This is a path of scientific research that is being implemented to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research targets include the development of the COVID-19 vaccine and the plasma transmission of the recovered person.SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 medicinal proteins, each of which has several ligand binding sites.
The analysis of these binding sites provides a reasonable plan for the development of an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, protein S, and ribophosphatase ADP.
Hussein A and colleagues looked at several proposed drugs that were then optimized and analyzed for their skeletal similarity with the most approved drugs to accelerate the development of the powerful anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in the preclinical study that was to be proposed in the design of the clinical study.
Chloroquine is an anti-malarial drug used to treat some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine were among the four drugs studied in the “unity” clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York state tests on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate with the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA in clinical trials, and its use is only permitted under the EUA for experimental treatment and emergency use in hospitalized patients who are unable to receive the drug in clinical trials.
The CDC states that “the need, dosage, or duration of hydroxychloroquine use for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection is not yet clear.”
Doctors have said they will take these medicines if there is no other option.
A research group in Istanbul, Turkey, is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine along with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Extensive studies are underway at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
The NYU Langone School of Medicine is conducting a trial on the safety and effectiveness of preventive hydroxychloroquine use.
Clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipiravir was “very effective”.
The test results were negative in 35 patients for an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease in 45 patients who did not receive it was 11 days.
In a Wuhan study of 240 pneumonia patients, half were given favipiravir and the other half omifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded people that the evidence on the effectiveness of the drug is inadequate and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for its reserves, and would use the military to deliver the drug to educational hospitals where it would use the drug to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has offered to buy the drug to the Trump administration. The drug may not be as effective in treating acute cases of the disease in which the virus has proliferated.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or those who are planning to become pregnant.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antiviral compounds lopinavir and ritonavir, determined that “no benefit was observed.”
These drugs were designed to prevent HIV from replicating by sticking to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify these drugs to find a compound that can bind to SARS-CoV-2 protease. The scientific community has raised criticisms about steering resources towards changing the use of drugs specifically designed to treat HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization has included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international "unity" trial.
Gilead Sciences developed Remdesivir as a treatment for Ebola viral disease and Marburg viral infections. Gilead Sciences later determined that Remdesivir was active in a laboratory setting against the viruses Philo, Phnom Penh, Paramixu and Corona.
One of the problems with antiviral therapy is the development of resistance through mutations that may lead to more severe and contagious diseases.
Some preliminary pre-experimental studies suggest that Remdesivir may be an effective genetic barrier to resistance formation. Several clinical trials are underway, including two run by the Cleveland Educational Hospital.
Three clinical trials are underway on the effect of intravenous injections of vitamin C on hospitalized people with severe COVID-19 disease. Two are controlled by placebo (China and Canada) and one is uncontrolled (Italy).
New York State began trials of antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
Japan’s National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning to run a clinical trial for Alvesco Tijin (cyclonide), an inhaled corticosteroid form of asthma, to treat patients without symptoms and infected with the new coronavirus.
A phase II trial on the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 involving 200 patients is underway. 200 hospitalized patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria are being administered to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are studying the role of chloroquine in reducing inflammation and respiratory consequences in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, titled Colecrona, involved 6,000 patients aged at least 40 who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and had mild, non-essential hospitalization symptoms.
Pregnant or breastfeeding women or women using effective contraceptive methods are not eligible to participate in this study.
Several blood clotting drugs are under investigation in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used for the treatment of patients, and for this reason, the Italian Medical Agency is required to publish guidelines for its use.
A multicenter study involving 300 patients to examine the effect of sodium enoxaparin on the dose of prevention and treatment was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a variant of the virus, significant scientific attention has been focused on changing the use of antiviral drugs developed to treat previous infectious diseases such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin recommended according to China’s 7th edition guidelines for the treatment of COVID-19
Omi Phenovir: Omi Phenovir was proposed to treat COVID-19 in accordance with China’s 7th edition guidelines
Antibiotics that have been proposed as a possible alternative to COVID-19 treatments include:
Tokilizumab (Anti-IL-6 receptor): Approved in China.
There are also trials in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab<0x23>COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, several attempts are underway to develop the vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, the virus-causing virus, to be available sooner than the next 18 months.
Five proposed vaccines were under Phase I safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A massive global outbreak occurred in 2020, leading to significant investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop a possible vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, it was announced that the requirements of the CEPI initiative for vaccine development were speed, production capacity, deployment on a scale and worldwide availability.
In April, CEP scientists announced that 10 different technology platforms were under investigation and development in early 2020 to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform objectives that have entered Phase I safety studies are:
Nucleic Acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I Developer and Proposed Vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (phase I developer and proposed vaccine: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenovirus vector)
According to CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 proposed vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of them have been approved as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others have been made public, but little is known about them (assuming they are in the planning or design phase).
The Phase I-II trial examines immunosuppression, usually randomized and controlled with placebo, runs at different centers, and determines more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials usually have more participants, including a control group, and while examining the effectiveness of the vaccine for disease prevention, they monitor adverse effects at optimal doses.
Of the 79 proposed vaccines in active development (approved by early April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested in humans (they are still in pre-clinical research).
On January 24, 2020, in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the vaccine’s ability to genetically modify viral proteins and simulate an immune response.
Around January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of research into a vaccine that is scheduled to begin human trials in 2021.
Vaccine development plans were introduced at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention on January 26, 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28.
Around January 29, 2020, Janssen pharmaceutical companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had begun the process of developing a vaccine.
Janssen, in collaboration with its biotech partner, Vaxart, is developing an oral vaccine.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop a vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen lab in Romania published an article designing a vaccine with the same technology as the vaccine used to treat neoantigen cancer.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the development of the vaccine and were at the beginning of the testing phase.
On February 27, 2020, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, a subsidiary of Generex, announced that it had launched a plan to develop a Li-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to develop a vaccine that could be tested in humans in 90 days.
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced its plans to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Facilities Centre at Fort Detrick, and the Walter Reed Military Research Institute at Silver Spring, both in West Maryland, announced they were developing a vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced its partnership with Novavax.
The development and production of vaccines has been announced.
The partners later announced that they are scheduled to conduct Phase I clinical trials and pre-clinical testing by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that it was testing 11 people in quarantine and that it would take at least one and a half to two years to develop the vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, announced the development of a coronavirus-like particle with a small funding from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
The proposed vaccine is in the phase of laboratory research and human trials are scheduled to take place in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, the Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered CureVac “exclusive access to the COVID-19 vaccine” in exchange for a “great sum of money” that the German government had opposed.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop the mRNA-based vaccine.
The proposed mRNA-based vaccine, called BNT162, is currently in preclinical testing phase and clinical trials are scheduled to begin in April 2020.
In Italy, on March 17, 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotech company, announced that the results of their pre-clinical trials would be ready in April 2020 and that their proposed final vaccine could be tested in humans before fall.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Innovation (CEPI) announced an investment of $4.9 million in a Covid-19 vaccine research consortium, including the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Venice, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh.
Other CEPI investment partners in the development of COVID-19 vaccines include Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six different vaccines on animals.
Researchers at the Royal College of London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine to fight COVID-19.
The vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving sequence data from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced that it had set aside $275 million to fund 96 research projects on COVID-19 measures, including several proposed vaccines at Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago initiatives and the University of Saskatchewan.
Around the same time, the Government of Canada announced that it had earmarked $192 million specifically for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, and plans are underway to develop a national “vaccine bank” consisting of several new vaccines that could be used if other coronavirus outbreaks occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine announced the test, the proposed COVID-19 vaccine, in mice, and announced that "the subunit vaccines of SARS-CoV-2 S1 containing strong antigen-specific antigen MNA reactions had been detected in mice 2 weeks after immunization."
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine, possibly in the form of nasal sprays.
Using bacteriophages, this DNA will be designed to replicate inside human bacteria and produce harmless virus-like particles. This process stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, the industry sector and three U.S. universities merged their resources to access IBM’s supercomputers, as well as the cloud computing resources of Hewlett Packard, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects or non-specific effects.
This means that they may have benefits beyond disease prevention.
Another randomized trial in Australia is set to enroll 4,170 healthcare workers.
Vaccines may not be safe or effective.
Preliminary research to assess the effectiveness of the vaccine using specific animal models of COVID-19, such as ACE2 transgenic mice, other lab animals and non-human primates, highlights the need for levels 3 biosafety prevention measures to work with live viruses and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
The SARS and MERS vaccines have been tested in non-human animal models.
By 2020, there will be no vaccine to treat or prevent SARS that has proven to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS has been a priority for governments and public health institutions around the world. There is no effective vaccine against MERS.
During the MERS outbreak, it was thought that current research on MERS would provide a useful template for the development of vaccines and drugs against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one MERS vaccine (DNA-based) that had passed Phase I clinical trials in humans, and there were three other vaccines, all of which were carriers of the virus.
Comments published on social media have promoted conspiracy theories about the known COVID-19 virus and the existence of a vaccine for it.
The inventions mentioned on various social media refers to previous inventions related to genetic sequences and vaccines related to other coronaviruses, such as SARS.
b'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease known to cause acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms are fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of hearing, and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to symptoms is usually about five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.
While most cases lead to mild symptoms, some lead to viral pneumonia and multi-organ defects.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported worldwide from 210 countries and territories, of which 153,000 resulted in deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is mainly transmitted through close contact, often through tiny droplets caused by coughing, sneezing or talking.
Although exhalation causes these droplets to be released, the droplets usually fall on the ground or on surfaces instead of being transported over long distances.
People may be affected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching the eyes, nose, and mouth.
The virus can live on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
The risk of contagion is higher in the first three days after the onset of symptoms. Of course, it is possible to spread the virus before the onset of symptoms and in later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is instantaneous reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from the nasopharyngeal swab.
Wearing masks is recommended for people suspected of contracting the virus and those around them.
The recommendation to wear a mask is different for the general public; some are against it, some are against it, and some consider it mandatory.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in all six WHO-covered regions.
People with the virus may have no symptoms or have flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency signs include difficulty breathing, pain or constant pressure in the chest area, dizziness, difficulty walking, and bruising of the face or lips. If these symptoms do not go away, you should see a doctor immediately.
Symptoms of upper respiratory tract, such as wheezing, runny nose or sore throat, have also been less common.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed in varying percentages.
Some cases in China at an early stage only experienced severe shortness of breath and heart palpitations.
In others, the disease may continue to develop into pneumonia, multi-organ defects, and even death.
This period is called the period of incubation.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but may range from two to 14 days.
In 97.5% of people, symptoms manifest within 11.5 days of being infected. Reports suggest that not all infected people necessarily have symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in the transmission process is not yet clear. Of course, preliminary evidence suggests that these individuals may be the cause of the outbreak.
The proportion of asymptomatic people is not yet known and is under investigation.The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospital stays.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in its statistics on April 1. Of the 166 infections of that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both sputum and saliva may be carriers of the virus.
Speaking loudly scatters more particles than speaking slowly.
Researchers in Singapore have proven that not covering your mouth and nose while coughing may cause the release of tiny droplets up to 4.5 metres (15 feet) away.
Although the virus is not usually aerobic, the National Academy of Sciences has said it is likely to be transmitted by air, and has seen positive samples of the virus' RNA in air collectors installed in the hallway outside people's rooms.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), may cause the release of respiratory secretions and spread of the virus through the air.
Although there are concerns about transmission of the virus through feces, this probability is assumed to be low. The likelihood of transmission of the virus through people with symptoms is higher. The likelihood of transmission of the virus before symptoms appear is lower.
The European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) said that despite the uncertainty of the disease transmission mechanism, each person usually infects two to three people.
In particular, the virus survives on cardboard for one day, on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) for three days, and on copper 99% for a maximum of four hours.
Of course, this time depends on humidity and temperature.
The right use of soap and detergent is also effective. Soap products remove the virus's fat-protective layer, deactivate it and remove it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chloroxydine gluconate, are less effective. In a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken an average of two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed a high viral load, and in the sixth, the highest viral load was seen on the second day of the test.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new type of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first taken from three people with pneumonia and related to the group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All symptoms of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in coronaviruses of a related nature.
The virus disappears outside the human body with household soap. Soap destroys its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
COVID-19 has the greatest impact on the lungs as the virus enters the host cell through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is abundant in type II lung bubble cells.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called spike (polymer) to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart damage was observed in 12% of infected and hospitalized people in Wuhan. This is more common in severe cases of the disease.
Cardiovascular symptoms due to inflammatory response and immune system disorders are high in the progression of the disease, but acute myocardial damage may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are abundant in the heart and play a role in heart activity.
High incidence rates of thrombosis (31%) and intravenous thromboembolism (25%) were observed in ICU patients with COVID-19 infection and may be related to poor diagnosis. The autopsies of people who died of COVID-19 showed scattered bubble damage (DAD) and the penetration of inflammation containing lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 tends to have enveloped cells with ACE2 in the respiratory tract, severe symptoms of systemic inflammation have been seen in patients with COVID-19.
In particular, the association of pathogenic GM-CSF T-cells with the absorption of inflammatory IL-6 secretion monocytes and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients has been established.
Influence of lymphocyte has also been reported during autopsy.
The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard detection method is instantaneous reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually done on respiratory samples obtained with nasopharyngeal swabs. Of course, nasal swabs or sputum samples can also be used.
Results are usually prepared within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can also be used, but this requires taking two blood samples at a two-week interval. In this type of test, the direct result is not of much value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a variant of the coronavirus and disseminate its genetic sequence. As a result, laboratories around the world were able to run independent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect viral infection.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which can diagnose active infections and a person's history of infection) were in the study but were not yet widely used.
The accuracy of this Chinese experiment is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point of care test on March 21, 2020 for use at the end of that month. Diagnostic guidelines from Wuhan University’s Zhongnan Hospital have proposed methods for detecting infection based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Multi-lobular matte glass opacity with lateral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution is used for diagnosis in the early stages of infection.
Sub-spiritual dominance, faulty coating (labyrinth blistering with variable blistering) and tightening may be a sign of disease progression.
Little is known about the microscopic damage and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The most important pathological findings in autopsy are:
Macroscopy: innate algebra, pericardial, hardening of the heart and respiratory edema
The four levels of severity of viral pneumonia are visible:
Mild pneumonia: Respiratory edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, abnormal large pneumocyte, intestinal inflammation with influence of lymphocyte and multi-nuclear large cell formation
Severe pneumonia: Dispersed bubble damage (DAD) with sporadic bubble discharge.
DAD is responsible for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Improving pneumonia: formation of discharges in bubble cavities and respiratory fissile fibrosis
Blood: sporadic intravenous clotting (DIC); Lukoritroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, maintaining respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering your mouth and nose with a paper towel when coughing and sneezing and using the inner part of the elbow if the towel is not available.
Hand hygiene is recommended after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC has proposed the use of cloth masks in public places to some extent, to prevent the spread of the disease by asymptomatic people. Social distancing strategies seek to reduce contact of infected people with large groups of people by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and canceling large gatherings.
The distance guidelines also include observing a distance of at least 6 feet (1.8 metres) between people.
There is no effective drug to prevent COVID-19. Since the discovery of a vaccine is not anticipated until at least 2021, an important part of the COVID-19 management process is an effort to reduce the peak of the pandemic, or "curve-leveling".
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. This is especially necessary after getting out of the toilet or after obvious hand contamination, before eating and after draining the nose, coughing or sneezing.
The CDC also recommends using hand sanitizer with an alcohol content of at least 60% if soap and water are not available. For areas where regular hand sanitizers are not available, the WHO has developed two formulas for local production.
In these formulations, the antimicrobial agent is obtained from ethanol or isopropanol.
To remove the microbial spores of alcohol, hydrogen peroxide is used; “it is not an active ingredient for hand disinfection.”
Glycerol is added as a moisture preservative.
People are managed with supportive care, which may include liquid-therapy, oxygen support, and support for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect they are infected use a simple mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being explored.
Personal hygiene and lifestyle and family diet changes have been proposed to strengthen safety.
Supportive therapies may be beneficial for people with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection. The WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have made recommendations to take care of people hospitalized for COVID-19.
Intensive care specialists and lung specialists in the United States have compiled treatment proposals from various institutions in the form of a free resource called IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
To alleviate symptoms, some medical professionals have identified the use of paracetamol (acetaminophen) for first-line use better than ibuprofen.
To minimize the possibility of transmission of the virus, precautions are necessary, especially in treatment locations where particulate matter-producing procedures, such as intubation or manual ventilation, are carried out.
For therapeutic professionals who care for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends keeping an individual in the "Aerobic Infection Quarantine Room" (AIIR) and using standard precautions, contact prevention measures and aerobic precautions. The CDC has published guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Proposals include PPE guns, respirators or face masks, eye protection and surgical gloves. If applicable, the use of a respirator mask (rather than a face mask) is a priority.
N95 respirator masks are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA has authorised the use of N95 respirators with emergency use authorization (EUA).
The mask is designed to protect against aerobic particles such as dust, but its efficacy against certain biological agents is not guaranteed for use outside the main application.
If the mask is not available, the CDC recommends wearing a face shield or, as a last resort, a handmade mask.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require the use of mechanical ventilation or alternative methods, but a percentage of them require these measures.
The type of respiratory support for people with respiratory failure caused by COVID-19 is being investigated in patients hospitalized. Some evidence suggests that intubation can be prevented with high-flow cannula through the nose or positive double-level pressure in the respiratory tract.
Whether either of these two approaches leads to similar benefits in sick patients is still unclear.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation, if any, because this method limits the spread of fine particles compared to high-flow nasal cannulas. Severe cases are more prevalent in the elderly (people over 60, and especially those over 80).
In many developed countries, hospital beds per capita are not enough. As a result, the capacity of the health system to manage the sudden increase in severe cases of COVID-19 that require hospitalization is limited.
In a study conducted in China, it was found that 5% of patients were admitted to intensive care, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people who are hospitalized for COVID-19 will end up in the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) becomes more severe in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
To maximize oxygen conductivity and reduce the risk of lung injury associated with the air conditioner and breast-feeding device, it is necessary to use a ventilator with high pressure control and PPEP modes.
Older air conditioners may not have high PEEP.
Research into possible treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in the clinical trial phase.
Remdesivir appears to be the most promising among the drugs.
While the development of new drugs will take time until 2021, several of the drugs being tested have already been approved for other uses or are in the advanced testing phase.
Antiviral medication may be tried in people with severe illness.
The WHO has suggested that volunteers take part in trials to examine the effectiveness and safety of possible drugs. The FDA has granted temporary authorization for the use of convalescent plasma as a trial treatment, in cases where a person's life is severely or completely at risk.
The drug has not passed the necessary clinical studies to prove the efficacy and safety associated with the disease.
In February 2020, China unveiled a mobile app to manage the spread of the disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and identification number.
The app can identify "closest contact" with the help of surveillance data and identify the likelihood of infection.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
If the potential risk is identified, the app will report the matter to local health authorities in addition to offering a home quarantine offer. Big data analytics in mobile phones, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking, and artificial intelligence have been used to track infected people and their associated people in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government made it possible for security agencies to intercept mobile data from people suspected of contracting COVID-19.
The measure was designed to quarantine and protect people who may have come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom provided the Robert Koch Institute with aggregated data on the location of the phone, from German federal government agencies, to allow for research into the spread and prevention of the virus.
Russia has used facial recognition technology to identify people who violate the quarantine.
Giulio Gallera, an Italian regional health officer, has been informed by mobile operators that “40% of people continue to move freely.”
The German government held a 48-hour weekend with more than 42,000 people.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid has also called for creative ways to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection may cause stress.
The BBC quoted Rory O’Connor as saying, “Increasing social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, psychological stress and economic problems can transform people’s mental and physical health.”
It may be mild or asymptomatic at some stages and may cause complications like other common diseases affecting the upper respiratory tract, such as the common cold.
Mild cases usually improve within two weeks, but it can take three to six weeks for people with severe or acute illness to recover.
Based on data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may be among the high-risk groups of COVID-19, although little is known about COVID-19. In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In sick people, COVID-19 may quickly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cause respiratory failure, infection shock, or multi-organ defects.
Consequences related to COVID-19 include infection, abnormal blood clotting, and heart, kidney and liver failure.
Blood clotting abnormalities, especially increased prothrombin time, were observed in 6% of people hospitalized for COVID-19. The prevalence of kidney failure was 4%.
Approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have seen signs of increased liver enzyme secretion (transaminase).
According to the same report, the average time between the appearance of symptoms and death was 10 days, five of which were hospitalized.
Of course, in patients transferred to an ICU, the average time interval between hospitalization and death was reported to be seven days.
A recent study found that the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days reported.
A study by the China National Health Commission (NHC) found that the mortality rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
Tissue-injury examinations of the lung samples of dead people showed scattered bubble damage and cellular fibromyoxide secretions in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes have been observed in pneumocytes.
The lung image was similar to the lung image of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by China’s National Health Commission, an increase in troponin or heart attack rates caused heart damage.
According to data from the United States in March, 89% of hospitalized people were already infected. Accessibility to medical resources and the socio-economic status of the region also affect the fatality rate.
Estimating the death toll from the disease varies due to regional differences as well as methodological difficulties.
A small number of mild cases may cause an overestimation of the fatality rate.
Of course, the fact that deaths were the result of previous cases may mean that the current mortality rate has been underestimated.
Smokers, compared with non-smokers, are 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and 2.4 times more likely to require special care or diet. The long-term consequences of the disease have raised concerns.
The Hong Kong Office of Hospitals reported a 20% to 30% reduction in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease and showed signs of organ damage in the lung scan.
This condition may lead to post-care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was not clear whether the history of the disease caused effective and long-term immunity in people who recovered from the disease.
Immunity is tolerated based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but in some cases, the test result has also been positive in people who have recovered from COVID-19.
It is believed that these cases are caused by the worsening of the latent infection and not by the recurrence of the infection.
It is thought that this natural, animal-based virus is overflowing through infection.
The true origin is unclear, but by December 2019 the outbreak was almost entirely based on human-to-human transmission.
With a review of the first 41 confirmed COVID-19 cases, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, the first case of symptoms dates back to December 1, 2019.
Official publications of the WHO have announced the date of the first appearance of symptoms on December 8, 2019.
To measure mortality, different criteria are usually used.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time spent on the initial outbreak and demographic characteristics such as age, gender and overall health.
In late 2019, the WHO assigned emergency U07.1 ICD-10 codes for deaths from SARS-CoV-2-approved infection in the laboratory and U07.2 for deaths from COVID-19 subject to clinical or epidemiological diagnosis without SARS-CoV-2-approved infection in the laboratory.
According to Johns Hopkins University, as of April 17, 2020, the global fatality rate was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
This number varies from region to region. Other measurements include case fatality rate (CFR), which determines the percentage of people diagnosed dying from disease. Infectious mortality rate (IFR) is another measure that determines the percentage of infected people (diagnosed and untreated) dying from disease.
These statistics are not time-limited and follow a specific population from the infection stage to the closing of the case.
Although not all infected people necessarily produce antibodies, the presence of antibodies may provide information about the number of infected people.
In a small village of 4,600 people, Castiglione d’Adda, the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, 80 people (1.7%) have died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread by the Carnival festivals. Infection of young people caused the mortality rate to be relatively low. However, some cases of COVID-19 deaths are not officially included in the category of deaths from the virus.
Meanwhile, the German health system has maintained its effectiveness.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of people may have developed antibodies, based on the evaluation of blood donors.
69 cases (0.004% of the population) of confirmed COVID-19 deaths have been recorded.
The impact of the pandemic and its fatality rates vary between men and women.
In studies conducted in China and Italy, the mortality rate for men was higher.
The highest risk in men is over the age of 50. This gap between men and women disappears by the age of 90.
In China, the death rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The reasons for this sex difference are unclear, but genetic and behavioral factors may influence it.
Gender-based immunological differences, a lower prevalence of smoking among women, and a higher incidence of men with similar diseases, such as hypertension, may contribute to higher mortality rates in men at a younger age than women.
In Europe, 57% of infected people died and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government has not taken any action to track gender-related data on COVID-19 infection.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of medical staff, especially nurses, are female and are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that COVID-19 was the official name of the disease.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO chairman, announced that coronavirus-related CO, VI, D stands for disease and 19 corresponds to the time of its first detection: December 31, 2019.
The name is used to prevent references to specific geographic locations (such as China), animal species or groups of people, based on international naming proposals and selected for the purpose of labeling prevention. The COVID-19-causing virus is called severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses the title "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 agent virus" in official communications.
The disease and the virus that causes it are collectively called "coronavirus".
In the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, the names "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus" were given in common to the virus and the disease.
In January 2020, the World Health Organization considered 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease as temporary names of the disease. These names were chosen according to the 2015 guidelines on the avoidance of including the names of places to name the virus and disease.
The official names for COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity constraints in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are producing health items such as nasal swabs and air conditioners.
For example, in one case, an Italian hospital needed a ventilator valve, and the supplier could not provide it in time. As a result, a local start-up reverse engineered and produced 100 valves overnight.
After the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, conspiracy theories, inaccurate information and incomplete information about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease were formed and quickly spread online.
The virus appears to be transmitted from humans to certain animals.
Studies of finding evidence of viral proliferation in pigs, ducks, and chickens have shown no results.
No medications or vaccines have been approved to treat this disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and drugs is underway among government agencies, scientific groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization conducted a “unity trial” to assess the therapeutic effect of the four most promising existing antiviral compounds.
There is no vaccine yet, but various agencies are actively investigating the proposed vaccines.
The results of previous studies on SARS-CoV are used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are under investigation.
First, researchers are looking to develop a complete virus vaccine.
The use of the virus, inactive or dead, is aimed at preventing an immune response in the human body against a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to develop a vaccine that can make the immune system susceptible to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research is based on the spike S protein, which helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy relates to nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, the new method of vaccine preparation).
Experimental vaccines for each of these strategies should be reviewed for safety and efficacy.On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains the harmless genetic code copied from the disease-causing virus. Antibody-based development has been proposed as a potential challenge for the development of the vaccine for SARS-COV-2, but there is room for debate in this regard.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials have been conducted.
Seven clinical trials evaluated treatments previously approved for the treatment of malaria, including four research projects on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Antiviral drugs are subject to change in most Chinese studies, which are expected to announce the results of nine phase III trials on remdesivir in several countries by the end of April.
As of April 2020, the dynamics of the clinical development of the COVID-19 vaccine and the proposed drugs have been investigated.Many antiviral drugs available to treat COVID-19 are under investigation, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir with the combination of beta interferon.
Until March 2020, there was inconclusive evidence about the effectiveness of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remdesivir without permission.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was reviewed in China in February 2020 and preliminary results were published.
Of course, the research community has been invited to criticize these results.
Health authorities in Korea and China have proposed the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, has stated that taking a double dose is very dangerous and may be deadly.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, at the discretion of physicians to treat people with COVID-19.In China’s Directive 7, interferon, ribavirin, or omiphenovir, for the treatment of COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high-dose ribavirin is necessary to prevent SARS-CoV-2 from proliferating in a laboratory setting.
Niazoxanide, after its low concentration effect in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication, has been proposed for research in the human body.Research has shown that preparation of primary spike protein with transmembrane 2 protease serine (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The study of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with/without azithromycin has major limitations that have prevented the medical community from accepting these treatments without examining them. Oseltamivir does not prevent SARS-CoV-2 from replicating in the laboratory environment and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 has not been established.
Cytokine storms may be complications of the later stages of severe COVID-19.
Evidence shows that hydroxychloroquine has anti-cyclokine properties. The China National Health Commission has included tokylisumab in the treatment guidelines after a brief review.
After the drug had positive results in people with severe disease, it was nationally tested for phase 2 non-randomization.
By combining serum ferritin blood tests to detect cytokine storms, it is used to counter this development, which is the cause of death for some people with the disease.
The FDA approved interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on previous studies to treat cytokine-resistant release syndrome caused by another cause, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized, controlled evidence for the effectiveness of tokilizumab for the treatment of CRS.
The transfer of pure and concentrated antibodies produced in the immune system of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to those who need it as a non-vaccinated method of passive immunization is under investigation.
This strategy was tested for SARS and the results were not conclusive.
Viral neutralization is the possible mechanism of action by which passive antibody-therapy provides the ground for defense against SARS-CoV-2.
Of course, other mechanisms, such as cellular cytotoxicity dependent on antibodies and/or phagocytosis, may be effective.
Other types of inactive antibodies, such as the use of synthetic monoclonal antibodies, are under investigation.
The production of convalescent serum, which includes the fluid portion of the blood taken from recovered individuals and contains specific antibodies to the virus, may increase for faster development.
Coronavirus-related diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a physician at the Wuhan Central Hospital, later died of Covid-19 after being informed by the public about the spread of the virus.
