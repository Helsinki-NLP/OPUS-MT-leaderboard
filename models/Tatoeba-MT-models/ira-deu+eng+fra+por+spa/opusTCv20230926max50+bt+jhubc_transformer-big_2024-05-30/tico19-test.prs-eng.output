The cumulative incidence of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is rapidly increasing in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from January 1 to March 15, 2020.
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) similar trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK suggest that although the prevalence varies in different countries at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience gained from the disease in Italy, countries, hospitals and importers of intensive care should increase their readiness for the large wave of COVID-19 patients who will need medical care, especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2020, a cluster of pneumonia patients with unknown cause was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, China's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the cause of the new coronavirus is now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date suggests that about 80% of the people infected with COVID-19 develop mildly as a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and most of these recover.
In about 14% of the vertebrae, COVID-19 became a more severe disease where patients were admitted to hospital, while 6% of the remaining vertebrae were placed in intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is around 4%.
In this study, we assess trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each of the EU/EEA countries and the UK, and compare this trend in Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with those in Italy from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 outbreaks in the EU/EEA and the UK
Subsequent to China, COVID-19 has spread to more geographic areas, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world are now following the same trend in the country.
On March 11, the Secretary-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
In a March 5 edition published in the journal Eurosurveillance 2020, Spitray and colleagues reported the first European definite coronavirus patient according to the definition of the World Health Organization.
In the European Union/European Economic Area, the first confirmed patients were reported by France on 24 January 2020 among returning passengers from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of March 15, 2020, in all 30 countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom (UK), the disease was diagnosed with COVID-19, and between December 31 and the end of 2019, 39,768 cases of meningitis and 1,727 deaths were reported, with Italy alone having 1,7750 cases and 1,441 deaths.
Receiving cumulative and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 patients
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), confirmed COVID-19 patients in any country of the world are received daily from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health, national and regional authorities in these countries and the World Health Organization, and updated at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to assess the trends of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK and compare them with Italy.
As a basis for determining the prevalence of active COVID-19 disease, we calculated a 14-day cumulative shortened incidence period for COVID-19 patients, so a normal COVID-19 timeframe was taken into account in each EU/EEA country and the UK, between January 1 and March 15, 2020.
Also, the cumulative number of patients in each country was compared to that in the period from January 31st to March 15th, 2020, according to 8.00 a.m.
Trends in Covid-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The observed trends in the short 14-day cumulative incidence of COVID-19 outbreaks in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally corresponded to the trends in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
In total, in the EU/EEA countries and the UK, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began around February 21, followed by a rapid increase around February 28, 2020 (added content).
This was largely due to a rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK also showed similar increases in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19.
Figure 2 compares the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with those in Italy from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
By 8 a.m. on March 15, 15 other EU/EEA member states and the UK reported the total number of affected vertebrae, comparable to that of Italy three weeks earlier or less.
Our results suggest that the number of COVID-19 patients in the EU/EEA countries and the UK is growing rapidly.
The trends observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is spreading at a similar pace across all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are experiencing different stages of the outbreak, that there are differences in responses from public health officials, and that different criteria apply to people in different countries who need to get a confirmation test or supplementary COVID-19 test.
In early March 2020, doctors in the Italian region of Manhattan reported a situation in which about 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care, and media sources reported that the maximum capacity of hospitals and intensive care imports in these areas had already been completed.
Currently, of the EU/EEA countries, only 6 percent and 1 percent respectively, data on the admission of COVID-19 patients are available in hospitals and/or in intensive care (data are not shown).
However, they need to be systematically compiled to supplement current surveillance data and focus on a number of reported cases and deaths.
A 2010-11 study found a huge difference in access to intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal for every 100,000 people.
This means that these countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care beds per 100,000 population in 2010-11).
Modeling scenarios related to the saturation of health and treatment capacity were presented with estimates for each EU/EEA member state and the UK in relation to the frequency of COVID-19 patients hospitalized with >90% risk exceeding the capacity of intensive care beds in the ECDC Sixth Rapid Risk Assessment in connection with COVID-19.
Since the affected population has so far been clustered in certain regions of the EU/EEA and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care facilities usually serve a regional population, information on the affected population and intensive care beds should be provided preferably in accordance with the Territorial Units Procedures for Statistical Level 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience of the disease in Italy and current trends in other countries indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in the EU/EEA countries and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and importers of intensive care should prepare themselves to deal with the ongoing mass transmission scenario of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and provide the necessary preparations for the admission of COVID-19 patients, especially in intensive care, as has happened in the region of Menton, Italy.
As stated in the recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, to delay the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into a rapid, pre-pandemic, and comprehensive approach, it is necessary to change attitudes from restriction to slow down the epidemic, because if the necessary measures have not been taken in advance, the rapid increase in the number of infected people may not provide sufficient opportunity to the decision-making bodies and hospitals to recognize, accept and apply appropriate responses.
The Rapid Risk Assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the effects of the pandemic.
Countries have a short-term opportunity to strengthen their control efforts and slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, thereby reducing the pressure on the healthcare system.
If this is not possible, health care systems in other EU/EEA countries may face a massive wave of patients in the coming days or weeks who need intensive care.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome) has resulted in more than 3,000 deaths and more than 80,000 deaths in China and other parts of the world, leading to a humanitarian disaster.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus may also have been transmitted through bats, similar to the homologous virus itself, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, and may lead to similar symptoms by adopting a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 is less severe and deadly than SARS, but it is more contagious and infects older people and men more than young people and women.
In response to the increasing number of publications associated with this emerging disease, this counterpart seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive review of this highly regarded research topic.
We will provide basic information related to epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of disease.
Although many questions remain unanswered, it is hoped that this review will be effective in identifying and eradicating this dangerous disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 became an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who were asked to stay at home because of the outbreak of a new viral disease, throughout the holidays and many weeks after.
The virus has a long homogeneity with the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), so on 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-CoV-2, and the associated disease was named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19) (coronavirus-19 disease or COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and around five other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has resulted in more than 80,000 cases, with the number of patients discharged exceeding 40,000, and more than 3,000 deaths.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that COVID-19 is "the number one public enemy" and is likely to be more powerful than terrorism.
According to the PubMed database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 scientific papers related to COVID-19 have been published, covering topics such as virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment since the first article reported on 7 January 2020.
The review aims to summarize research advances in new areas of interest.
In possible cases, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronavirus-related disease called the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (a disease that spread in 2012).
We will discuss what we have learned so far in connection with the prognosis of the disease, and we will also discuss a number of other vital questions.
Coronaviruses were traditionally considered non-lethal pathogens for humans and accounted for about 15% of common colds.
However, in this century, we have encountered two highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which, respectively, caused an early outbreak of the disease in 2003 in China and 2012 in Saudi Arabia and spread to other countries in a short time, causing terrible disease and death.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third coronavirus outbreak in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure 1, pneumonia clusters of unknown origin were first reported from Wuhan to the China National Health Commission on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the sequence of the coronavirus spread.
On January 15, 2020, the first case of Wuhan death was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic quickly spread to neighboring cities, other provinces and countries.
On January 20, the health care workers were reported to be infected, showing that human-to-human transmission of the virus was also possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was supplemented by quarantine, and public commute to and from it was stopped.
On January 24, the first clinical study on disease reported that only 21 out of 40 patients had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, where the disease began from an unspecified animal source.
On January 30, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
By the time the report is published, the disease has spread throughout China and around 50 other countries around the world.
Since the situation is changing rapidly, the extent and severity of the final outbreak should be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a study involving several research centers on 8,866 coronavirus patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, provided a more up-to-date representation of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
The SARS-CoV-2 virus infects people of all ages, but mostly ages 65-30.
Almost half (47.7%) of the affected spine were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus infects more men (0.31 out of 100,000) than women (0.27 out of 100,000).
COVID-19 spreads as clusters in and around Hubei.
Diagnosis of COVID-19 took 5 days (9-2) days since its inception.
The period of the Commune (7.2.2-3.0.0) is 4.8 days.
The time from the onset of the disease to death (4.8-13) was 9.5 days.
The base reproduction rate (R<sub>0</sub>) was 3.77 (with a reliability limit: 4.05-3.51) and the adjusted R<sub>0</sub> was 4.82-2.23.
The number of poor people affected rose exponentially before January 23, 2020, corresponding to the time when the volume of travel before the Spring Festival in China increased.
The mortality of confirmed patients was 1.44 percent (with an approximate 95 percent confidence equivalent: 1.86-1.10 percent) and the adjusted mortality rate of all patients was 3.06 percent (with an approximate 95 percent confidence equivalent: 4.59-2.02 percent).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender, age (60 years or older), and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large, coated viruses that contain a single strand of RNA.
They are categorized into four genomes, alpha, beta, gamma and delta, among which alpha and beta coronaviruses are human.
Glycoprotein spike (S) covering the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses bind to their cell receptors, the angiotensin-2 (ACE2) and dipeptidel peptidase 4 (DPP4), respectively.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after the viral genome is replicated, the genome RNA, together with a coating of glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, forms virion-containing vesicles that are then merged with the plasma membrane, leading to the release of the new virus.
The first genome sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was reported on January 10, 2020.
The findings showed that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-CoV, with 10 confirmed samples from the main site of the outbreak at the Hunan Seafood Market in Wuhan, with 99.98 percent similarity.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through an examination with an electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in ultra-thin segments of human airway epithelium.
Human ACE2 is known as the recipient of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus provides a weaker binding to the human ACE2 receptor than the SARS-CoV virus, which corresponds to the fact that the SARS-CoV-2 virus causes a weaker disease than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 also produces a new short protein fertilized by orf3b and a secreted protein fertilized by orf8.
The protein orf3b of the SARS-CoV-2 virus plays a role in the pathogenic properties of the virus and prevents the expression of IFN<0xCE><0xB2> (bita interferon); however, orf8 does not contain any known functional second or motif.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou et al. reported the cryo-microscope structure of the electron supplement of the human ACE2 receptor with a 2.9-resolution angstrom in the complex along with an amino acid carrier called B0AT1.
They found that the above complex, which has open and closed configurations, is assembled as a dimmer, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind to two S proteins that can be used as a benchmark for detecting and infecting coronaviruses.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for drug screening to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and Intermediate Host
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have both been found to originate from bats and have been transmitted to humans through cats and camels, respectively.
By comparing phylogenetically SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, bats were introduced as the main host of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is 96% similar to two SARS-like coronaviruses: bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, which intermediate host has helped the virus cross species boundaries and infect humans is still unknown and the path of transmission should be clear.
Jay and colleagues suggested that snakes carried the virus from bats to humans through homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolins — ant-eaten mammals with long trunks — often used in traditional Chinese medicine, based on genetic homology with a coronavirus found in pangolins and the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the likely intermediate host of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
However, the 1% difference between the two genomes is still a big difference; therefore, conclusive results are expected to be provided for coherent evidence (Figure 3).
The physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in-vitro conditions for 48 hours in a dry environment, with a duration of less than 20<0xC2><0xB0>C and humidity of 50–40% to 5 days.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus may have similar characteristics.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to the following vertebrae that effectively inactivate the virus: ultraviolet radiation and exposure for 30 minutes at 56<0xC2><0xB0>C; ether, 75% ethanol, a disinfectant solution containing chlorine, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents, but chlorhexidine does not.
In general, all human populations are immune to SARS-CoV-2 and are therefore susceptible to the new virus.
Currently, the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 has not been reported in a detailed study.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
The virus is initially detected by the host's innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including C-like receptors, TLR-like receptors, NLR-NOD receptors, and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs).
In a variety of ways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturity of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of I-type interferons (IFNs), which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of antiviral genes by macrophages.
However, SARS-CoV-related N proteins can help save the virus from the responses of the immune system.
The adaptive immunity response will soon be in place to fight the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4-type T cells stimulate B cells to stimulate virus-specific antibodies, and CD8-type T cells directly kill the virus-infected cells.
T cells help produce inflammatory cytokines to help defense cells.
However, coronavirus can inhibit cell T functions by inducing apoptosis.
The blood exemption includes compounds including C3a and C5a, and antibodies are rolling against viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the overreaction of the modafa system produces a large amount of local free radicals, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, multi-organ inadequacy and even death.
SARS-CoV-2, which is a cluster-specific prevalence, is more likely to be associated with malignant diseases and pregnant women.
It is normal for people exposed to a large number of viruses or those whose immune functions are impaired to have a higher chance of survival than others.
The duration of SARS-CoV-2 is approximately 1 to 14 days, with a study of 425 first patients in Wuhan showing that it is mainly 3 to 7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 patients found that the incubation period ranged from 3 days to a total of 0 to 24 days.
A newer study mentioned above, based on a demographic survey of 8.866 patients, listed the period of the commune as 4.8 (3.2-3.0) days.
It is very important for health authorities to implement effective quarantine time based on the most correct period of the commune to prevent transmission of the virus to others by the affected but asymptomatic spine.
As a general rule, people who are infected with the virus or are infected with the virus should be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the primary symptom of COVID-19, which may occur on its own or be accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, runny nose, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients developed shortness of breath and/or tissue oxygen reduction a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe spine, symptoms of acute respiratory syndrome, antenna shock, metabolic acidosis and blood clotting disorder were observed in patients.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even if they lack abnormalities in pulmonary imaging, should be screened for the virus as soon as possible.
A demographic study in late December 2019 found that the percentage of symptoms observed in patients were as follows: 98% fever, 76% dry cough, 55% shortness of breath and 3% diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilation.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies on a family cluster and a cluster formed by asymptomatic transmission.
In comparison, a 2012 demographic study found that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%) as the main symptoms of the disease.
However, 80 percent of them needed assisted breathing, which was much higher than that of COVID-19 patients, and was consistent with the higher mortality rate of MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In SARS patients, it was found that the main symptoms of the disease were fever (99% to 100%), dry cough (29% to 75%), shortness of breath (40% to 42%), diarrhea (20% to 25%), and sore throat (13% to 25%), and about 14% to 20% of patients needed help with breathing.
As of February 14, when confirmed cases worldwide reached 66.576, the worldwide COVID-19 mortality rate was 2%.
For comparison, the mortality rate of SARS as of November 2002 was 10% of 8,096 confirmed patients.
In relation to MERS, according to a demographic study in June 2012, the mortality rate was 37% out of 2.494 patients.
A previous study reported that <i>R</i> <i>sub>0</i></sub> the SARS-CoV-2 virus was long and equal to 6.47 with a confidence interval (CI) of 7.23-5.71, while the <i>R0</i> SARS-Cov virus was only 2 to 4.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in relation to symptoms, mortality and <i>R</i><i><sub>0</i></sub> is provided in Table 1.
The numbers above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater ability to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the death toll is lower than these two.
Therefore, controlling the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is much more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Clusters often start from within a family or community or a single vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or stay in Wuhan or other parts of Manhattan, or had contact with people or patients within two weeks of the onset of the disease.
However, it has been reported that people can have the virus for up to two weeks without any symptoms, and it is possible that recovered patients discharged from the hospital will still have the virus in the body, leading to an increase in the duration of quarantine.
In the early stage, the number of peripheral white globules (especially lymphocytes) in patients is normal or reduced.
For example, lymphopenia with a white blood cell count of less than 10<sup>9</sup><0xC3><0x97>4 cells per liter including lymphocyte counts of less than 10<sup>9</sup><0xC3><0x97>1 cells per liter and increased concentrations of aminotransferase aspartate and viremia (seeing the virus in the blood) were observed in 1.099 COVID-19 patients.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin were found in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and sodiumantation of erythrocytes were elevated in the blood of most patients.
In severe disease, D-dimer levels, a product of fibrin destruction in the blood, were elevated and the number of lymphocytes was steadily decreasing.
Anomalies are found in most COVID-19 patients' chest radiography and include symmetrical patchy shadows or rounded opacities in the lungs.
Patients often develop abnormal pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis make the exchange of respiratory gases extremely difficult.
Functional dysfunction of pulmonary pneumocytes reduces the type one and two surfactant values, and as a result, surface tension increases, which reduces the ability of the lungs to expand and increases the risk of pulmonary claps.
Thus, the most severe findings of chest radiography matched the most severe degrees of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 introduced the following symptoms: filtration of pulmonary pneumocytes, formation of transparent membranes, translucent interstitial lymphocytes, and observation of multicellular cystic cells in the lungs of patients who died of disease; symptoms that were similar to viral infection pathology and acute respiratory distress syndrome and SARS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA was carried out through reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, because of the high false negative rates that may accelerate the epidemic, on February 13, 2020, clinical demonstrations began to be used in China to diagnose the disease (a diagnostic method that no longer relies solely on RT-PCR).
There was a similar situation with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is necessary for an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang Group introduced the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus, in which synthetic RNA fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in volumes <sup>18-</sup>10 <0xC3><0x97> 20 moles per liter to <sup>18-</sup>10 <0xC3><0x97> 200 moles per mill.
It is hoped that this new technique, if approved in clinical samples, can improve sensitivity and comfort.
Because of the lack of experience with the novel coronavirus, doctors primarily provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while also trying to use various treatment measures that have been used or proposed for the treatment of previous coronavirus outbreaks, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These treatments include psychedelic and potential antiviral therapies, system suppressors, steroids, plasma of recovered patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even the use of plasma for improved patients has been suggested for the treatment of new patients.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing to produce antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus initially attacks mainly the lungs and possibly to a lesser extent other organs that express the ACE2 receptor, such as the digestive system and pollen.
However, respiratory disorders and inadequacies are a major threat to patients and a leading cause of death.
Therefore, assisted breathing strategies are critical to relieve symptoms and save lives and include treatment with regular oxygen, long circulation of oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and aggressive mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients suffering from severe respiratory symptoms should undergo exogenous membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified pulmonary bypass technique previously used for the treatment of fatal cardiac or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining the balance of electrolytes, the prevention and treatment of secondary infection and antibody shock, and the protection of vital organ functions are also essential for patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Cytokine storms in SARS and MERS patients have been proven to be caused by the overreaction of the MDMA system.
Cytokine storm is a systemic inflammatory reaction characterized by the release of a series of cytokines including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce the cells of the circulatory system to release many free radicals, which is the main cause of ARDS and the inadequacy of various organs.
Suppression of the modafinil system is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storms.
Other modafinil suppressive treatment approaches for cytokine storm include: immune response modulation under cell T-command; blockage of IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1 and TNF function; JAK inhibition; Blinatomb; Cytokine 4 signaling inhibitor; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids were widely used as a system-suppressing spice in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids have not been shown to improve severe lung injury in patients with COVID-19 and SARS.
Instead, they may cause severe side effects, especially osteoporosis caused by anemia, which significantly affects the prognosis of the disease.
However, it is recommended to use with caution short courses of treatment with low-to-moderate doses of corticosteroids for the treatment of patients with critical condition COVID-19.
At the time of writing, which effective antiviral has not been confirmed.
However, Remdesivir intravenous injection, a nucleotide analogue, has been shown to be effective in an American patient suffering from COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead primarily for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Later, it was found that remdesivir may also have an inhibitory effect on other monostrial RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
Accordingly, Gilead gave the compound to China to test two clinical trials on the patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the results were quite expected.
In addition, barcitinb, interferon-alpha, lupinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin were also used as potential spices for treating patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions can occur following a combined treatment with leupinavir/ritonavir.
The interactions between these drugs and other medications used by the patient should be carefully considered.
Plasma from recovered patients and antibody production
The collection of blood from patients who have recovered from a contagious disease, for the treatment of other patients with the same disease, or to protect healthy people from infection, has a long history.
In fact, recovered patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies to fight the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight against pathogens and other foreign particles that detect and neutralize unique molecules in the pathogens.
Accordingly, the plasma was collected from a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 very serious patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, reducing inflammation, reducing viral load and improving oxygen saturation in their blood.
However, recommending this method for large-scale use before specific treatment methods have yet to be developed requires further approval and clarification.
In addition, in addition to the therapeutic effects, the disadvantages associated with plasma therapy should also be considered carefully.
For example, antibodies overstimulate the immune response and can cause cytokine release syndrome, which may lead to a fatal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and it is necessary to treat people who have a very severe disease with a lot of plasma.
The development and production of specific antibodies in a fast-paced period of time is difficult to cope with global epidemics.
Therefore, isolating B cells from improved patients and identifying genetic fertilizers that encode effective antibodies or screening for effective antibodies against effective virus proteins is more critical and practical.
In this way, it is easy to increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional medicine has been used in China for thousands of years to treat a wide range of diseases.
However, its effectiveness depends mainly on a combination of several components of a formula, which depends on the diagnosis of the disease based on theories of traditional Chinese medicine.
Most of the effective components remain unknown or obscure because it is difficult to extract and verify these or their optimal components.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM is considered one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for patients who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, it was observed that Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest rates of treatment for COVID-19 patients were observed in several Chinese provinces where traditional Chinese medicine was used for 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7 percent), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, where traditional Chinese medicine was used for only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is an extremely difficult comparison, as many other influencers, such as the number and severity of patients, need to be considered.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing treatment with Western medicine (WM) alone with combined treatment of Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine.
They found that the time it took to restore body temperature to optimum, relieve symptoms and hospitalization in the Western Medicine + Traditional Chinese Medicine group was significantly less than in the Western Medicine group alone.
Interestingly, the rate of exacerbation of symptoms (from mild to severe) for the WM+TCM group (traditional Chinese+Western Medicine) was markedly lower than that of the Western Medicine group (7.4 percent versus 46.2%) and the mortality rate in the Western Medical+Traditional Medicine group was also lower than that of the Western Medicine-only group (4.8 percent versus 39 percent).
However, the effectiveness and safety of traditional Chinese medicine should still be assessed through carefully controlled trials on larger scales and in more centers.
Attempting to determine the mechanism of action and determine the effective components of traditional Chinese medicine treatments or, if possible, a combination of them is interesting and tempting.
Suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients often experience many of the horrors of this highly contagious and even deadly disease, and quarantined people continue to be bored, lonely, and angry.
In addition, symptoms of infection, including fever, oxygen deficiency and coughing, as well as side effects of treatment strategies, including insomnia caused by corticosteroids, anxiety and mental distress, can occur.
In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a range of psychotic conditions were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks and panic attacks, psychomotor stimulation, psychotic symptoms, psychosis, and even suicidal tendencies.
Compulsory contact tracing and quarantine, as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, can cause stress and feelings of guilt in the affected elderly associated with the effects of contagion, quarantine, and reputational problems for families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspects, and people in contact with them, as well as to the general public who need these services.
Psychological support should include the formation of mental health teams with multiple specializations, transparent information with regular and accurate news about SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and treatment programs, along with the use of electronic devices and vocational applications to avoid close contact with others.
Effective vaccines are of fundamental importance to cut off the chain of transmission from animal reservoirs and human spinal cords to sensitive hosts and are often complementary to antiviral therapy in controlling epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts to develop protein-based S vaccines have been made to produce long-term, powerful neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live vaccines diluted in animal models have been tested for SARS.
However, before a clinical study can begin, the effectiveness of in-vivo vaccine candidates in Kahlan and dying models and their protection against zoonotic infection should be determined.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS disappeared 17 years ago and that no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, individual spines and occasional mers clusters continue to be seen in the Middle East and are spread to other regions due to the sustainability of zoonotic resources in indigenous areas.
Vaccination strategies were developed using passive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viral-like particles, and recombinant protein subunits for MERS and were tested in some vertebrae on animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for people without immunity is critical to controlling the growing epidemic.
However, due to the length of time it takes to design and produce a vaccine (around 18 months) and the dynamic transformations of coronaviruses, it is challenging to deal with this problem.
As an emerging disease, COVID-19 has just begun to show its complementary clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients recover gradually without any complications.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has been linked to high morbidity and mortality in severely ill patients.
Therefore, designing a prognostic model for disease is essential for healthcare organizations to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies conducted so far, the following factors may affect the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients or may be associated with this diagnosis (Table 3):
Age: Age is the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, as is the case with COVID-19.
Covid-19 occurs mainly at the age of 65-30, with more than 50-year-olds in a study involving 8,866 patients described above being 47.7% infected.
Patients who needed intensive care were more likely to suffer from underlying health conditions and complications and were older than non-essential patients (with an average age of 66 versus 51), suggesting that age could be considered a prognostic factor for the outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: As mentioned above, the SARS-CoV-2 virus infects more men than women (0.31 per 100,000 compared to 0.27 per 100,000).
Complications and Complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart damage or arrhythmia.
Heart problems were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus has also been reported to bind to ACE2-positive macroglobulins, which may lead to liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and underlying disease have a strong correlation and may interfere with each other.
Non-Narmel laboratory findings: The level of C-reactive protein in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue damage and has been proposed as a potential diagnostic factor for disease, response to treatment, and final recovery.
It has been suggested that there is a link between CRP levels with the severity and prognosis of COVID-19.
In addition, increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also be effective in predicting outcomes.
These enzymes are expressed extensively in several tissues, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional markers for diagnosing heart or liver disorders.
Primary clinical symptoms: To predict the consequences and complications of COVID-19, chest radiography and the timing of clinical symptoms should be taken together with other related issues.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are complementary system suppression agents that are commonly used as complementary treatments to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage in the fight against antibody diseases.
Since high doses of corticosteroids were widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors suffered from osteoporosis associated with long-term disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at lower doses and over short periods of time for patients with COVID-19.
Psychological stress: As described above, due to the spread of COVID-19, many patients became overstressed because they often had to adhere to long periods of quarantine, had many doubts about what was going on, and witnessed the death of family members or close friends.
Psychological counseling and long-term support are essential to help these patients relieve stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 has different epidemiological features compared to SARS.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, the SARS-CoV-2 virus is able to replicate effectively, similar to other common cold-causing coronaviruses in the upper respiratory tract, and may or may not have symptoms early in the infection phase.
Therefore, in the early stage of the disease or incubation period, patients produce large amounts of the virus during daily activities, which can cause a lot of trouble for controlling the epidemic.
However, the findings suggest that SARS-CoV transmission was carried out when patients were in a severe phase of the disease, thus most transmissions did not occur in the initial phase.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is more dangerous and more difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Very good efforts are underway in China, which includes supplemental controls of entry and exit to Wuhan and nearby cities, and a continuous quarantine of almost the entire population in the hopes of cutting off the transmission chain of SARS-CoV-2.
While these measures have significantly harmed the economy and other parts of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March, and the phase of protracted degeneration will last for three to four months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter and colleagues estimate that the COVID-19 epidemic, which is significantly more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and her colleagues developed a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic, suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected in both series of nasal and throat swabs in recovered patients who were discharged two weeks before the hospital.
However, based on the decline in the number of new cases, which means the potential success of current strategies, there are promising prospects in China.
Initially, Ebola was predicted to infect up to one million people and cause half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was finally under control.
Similar to SARS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 virus may gradually become weaker and eventually disappear or become a less pathogenic virus that lives alongside humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS is presented below (Figure 5).
SARS-CoV-2 has a long transmission by coughing or sneezing and is likely to spread through direct contact with the virus.
The virus was also found in gaseous substances, which raises the possibility of new transmission from gaseous-feminine matter.
A recent study of 138 patients reported that 41 percent of people were likely infected by hospital infections, including 17 patients with other illnesses and 40 health care staff.
Therefore, in order to protect people and in particular health care workers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even visitors of people with underlying health conditions, it is necessary to take extreme precautions.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk is by wearing face masks; both surgical masks and N95 respirators (series No. 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent airborne droplets of respiratory fluid from potentially contaminated spines to others or sticking these droplets to the surfaces of the material and then transferring to others.
However, just wearing N95 (Number of the 1860s) series masks can protect you against breathing 10 to 80 nm virions, which only 5% of the virions are able to penetrate; the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the same size as SARS-CoV, and the size of both is approximately 85 nm.
Since the particles can even be shot through five surgical masks, health care providers in direct contact with patients should wear N95 masks (series No. 1860s) and refrain from wearing surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care workers should wear fully-wearing isolation to reduce the likelihood of contact with the virus.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 while wearing an N95 mask; it may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also wear transparent face shields or glasses when dealing with patients.
With a view to public health in areas with potential contamination, it is strongly recommended that individuals wash their hands with disinfectant soaps more often than usual, turn to self-contained and stay at home, and limit contact with potential contaminants.
The appropriate distance that people should have with patients is three feet.
These measures are considered effective ways to reduce and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus is considered an emerging virus for the human world, its long homogeneity with SARS-CoV, reported on 7 January 2020, was a serious warning to China, bringing back memories of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, there was no public-relaxation effort until January 19, 2020, when the head of the Wuhan Centers for Disease Control announced that the new virus had limited human-to-human transmission and could be prevented.
The message did not take the public alarm too seriously, especially as the whole country was preparing for the New Year Spring Festival and thus missed a vital opportunity to prevent the spread of the disease on a minimal scale in Wuhan.
China’s disease-controlling organizations may have learned the hard lesson and made key improvements to future measures.
For example, these organizations should (1) be more cautious when making public announcements, as any information they provide will be addressed to the public and the test can transform their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to community-focused information from clinics; and (3) be more stringent in inviting the public to notify the public about the potential epidemic at the initial stages.
The outbreak of COVID-19, which is caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus, began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease has spread throughout China and by the time this article is written, it has spread to about 50 other countries around the world.
Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS are similar, the outbreak of COVID-19 initially gave the impression that SARS has come back.
However, there are several distinct differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are critical to preventing epidemics and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people and men more than younger people and women, and its severity and mortality rates are still higher in lazy people than in young people.
The mortality rate of SARS is higher than that of COVID-19 (10.91 percent versus 1.44 percent).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the disease even when they do not have symptoms, while SARS patients usually transmit when the disease is very severe, making it much more difficult to prevent the spread of COVID-19 compared to SARS.
This partially explains why the SARS-CoV-2 virus spreads much faster and on a larger scale than SARS-CoV.
In some COVID-19 patients, the usual RNA test to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus may have a negative result.
On the other hand, patients who have recovered can be re-infected with the virus.
These findings significantly increase the risk of spreading the virus.
Given this rate of rapid progress in COVID-19 research, there are still several unresolved critical issues, including:
Where did the SARS-CoV-2 virus come from?
Although 96% genetic homogeneity was found between the SARS-CoV-2 virus and two bat-like SARS-CoVs, we still can't conclude that the SARS-CoV-2 virus originated from bats.
What animal was the intermediate type for transmitting the virus from its main host, bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to questions 1 and 2, we cannot effectively cut off the transmission chain and the outbreak may resume at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical assessments have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 receptor, how exactly does the virus enter the airway cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus bind to ACE2-expressing cells in other organs?
Until these questions are answered clearly, we will not be able to achieve a quick, accurate and effective diagnosis and treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically when it is transmitted between people?
Will it become a global pandemic, disappears like SARS, or re-emerges like the flu?
Finding the answer to the above and many other questions is important, but it may take some time.
However, regardless of the cost, our only option is to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and bring life back to normal.
Animal origins of human coronaviruses
For thousands of years, mutation and compromise have contributed to the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans.
Prior to 2003, two human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illnesses, such as common falls.
The outbreak of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have caused the other side of the coin to show the extent of destruction and potential risk of a human coronavirus infection.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 brought coronaviruses back to the spotlight and surprised us with its long transmission capability, but its pathogenicity is less than that of its sister SARS-CoV.
Human coronavirus infection is of animal origin (zoonosis), and understanding the animal origin of human coronaviruses can help.
Most human coronaviruses start with bats, which are non-petogenic.
Source reservoir hosts are also known to interface some human coronaviruses.
The identification of host animals directly contributes to the prevention of human diseases.
Research into the interactions of the host of the coronavirus in animals can provide us with important information about the potential of pathogens in humans.
In this review, we provide an overview of the information available in connection with the seven existing HCoVs and focus on the history of their discovery, as well as animal origin and interspecies transmission.
Most importantly, we compare and deal with different human coronaviruses from the point of view of the evolution of the virus and recombination of genomes.
The current coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) is being discussed in this context.
In addition, the conditions for a successful transfer between hosts and the evolution of the high-intensity virus became the focus of attention.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which includes a group of single-stranded, sub-positive RNA viruses.
"These viruses, which have the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobytes among RNA viruses, were called 'CoVs' or coronary viruses because of their coronary-like morphology under an electronic microscope."
As a structure, coronaviruses have one-piece genomes that have a similar organization.
About two-thirds of the genome consists of two overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into polyprotein replicas pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyproteins are processed to produce 16 non-structural proteins called nsp1 to 16.
The remaining protein is the genome, including ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), viral coating (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of lineage-specific side proteins are fertilized by different forms of the coronavirus.
Due to differences in protein sequences, coronaviruses are divided into four sexes (alpha-coronavirus, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV) and among them, the genus beta-CoV comprises the majority of human coronaviruses and is divided into four sub-linings (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents act as a genetic source of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main reservoir of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have consistently crossed interspecies barriers, with some emerging as important human papillae.
To date, seven human coronaviruses have been identified.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
Five other types of beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV-caused severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome-caused coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as normal fallout and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, recently identified, are highly pathogenic and cause more severe lower respiratory tract infections in patients, making them more likely to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extra-pulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the nasal mucosa of patients who fell ill in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more information has been gained by conducting extensive studies of high levels of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, until the SARS outbreak, the concept was widely accepted that human coronavirus infections were generally harmless.
The outbreak of SARS in 2003 is one of the most devastating examples of the modern era, with more than 8,000 people being infected, with a mortality rate of around 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak (MERS) caused a persistent outbreak in the Arabian Peninsula, and rare cases spread to other parts of the world.
The new 2019 human coronavirus (2019-nCoV), later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the ongoing coronavirus epidemic (COVID-19), which has claimed 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm is ringing and the world must prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses have animal origins from bats, mice and domestic animals.
Numerous evidence confirms that all human coronaviruses have evolved from bats, in which viruses adapt well but are non-pathogenic and have a high genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.
Tracking the animal origin of human coronaviruses provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving force and limiting factors of mutation of species.
It may also facilitate or direct research on reservoir animals, intermediaries and replicators of SARS-CoV-2, and may be used to prevent similar cases from occurring in the future.
In this review, we provide an overview of animal origin, interspecies transmission and human coronavirus pathogen function.
Specifically, we highlight and discuss the common occurrence that parent viruses of HCoVs are typically non-pathogenic in their reservoir hosts, but become pathogenic after interspecies transmission to a new host.
We continue to study the evolution of the human coronavirus, in which the increase in transmissibility is often accompanied by a decrease in the functioning of the petogenesis.
The results of the ongoing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 are also discussed in this context.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the initial isolation of HCoV-229E strain B814, different types of coronaviruses were obtained from different manganese animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, and dogs.
In the past few decades, seven human coronaviruses have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of HCoVs in the temporal sequence (Table 1) can be informative and useful.
The first HCoV-229E strain was taken from the respiratory tract in 1966 by patients infected with the upper part of the respiratory system, after which it was adapted to grow in the WI-38 respiratory cell lines.
Patients diagnosed with HCoV-229E showed symptoms such as normal loss, including headaches, sneezing, feeling sick and sore throat, along with fever and cough in 10 to 20 percent of cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from tissue implants and the subsequent machine gun passage in the brains of mice.
It turns out that the clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which are similar to those of other respiratory tract pathogens, including influenza-type A viruses and rhinoviruses, in terms of symptoms.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 have both spread globally and are generally transmitted during winter and in temperate climates.
Generally, the incubation time of the two viruses is less than a week, followed by a period of about two weeks.
Based on a human study of volunteers, healthy people who were infected with HCoV-229E were mildly affected.
Only a few patients with weakened immune systems suffered severe infections in the lower respiratory system.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia," was the first documented instance of the human coronavirus pandemic in human history, and its etiological agent SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus, was discovered.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic has resulted in 8,096 reported cases of infection with 774 deaths and has spread to many countries and continents.
Apart from the mass spread events, it was estimated that each event could lead to approximately two secondary infections, with a period of 4-7 days and a peak viral load that appears on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV first experienced symptoms such as muscle pain, headaches, fever, weakness, and chills, and then shortness of breath, cough, and respiratory distress in the final stages.
Lymphopenia, figures outside the scope of liver function tests and high levels of creatine kinase are among the common non-harmal laboratory results of SARS.
In SARS patients, cases of scattered alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and increased macrophages have also been observed.
About 20 to 30 percent of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory system, multiple organs, including the digestive system, liver, and kidney, can be infected in these acute cases, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm and may be especially fatal in patients with weakened immune systems.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy by a relative who had traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, a lot of research has been done on the human coronavirus.
HCoV-NL63 was separated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was first observed that it was common among young children, lame and patients with weakened immune systems or respiratory disease.
Infection, inflammation, fever, and bronchiolitis are common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study describes the isolation of a similar virus from an 8-month-old baby's nasal mucus sample in the Netherlands.
Although this has been identified in the Netherlands, it has actually spread all over the world.
HCoV-NL63 is estimated to be responsible for about 4.7% of respiratory-related diseases, and its prevalence peaks in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is also linked to obstructive laryngitis, also known as laryngeal inflammation.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was separated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized in Hong Kong with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.
In addition to pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has also been linked to acute asthma exacerbation.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was identified worldwide as causing mild respiratory diseases.
All four cases of HCoVs are well-adapted to human populations and are generally less likely to mutate to cause long-term pathogenic diseases, although for unknown reasons it has been observed in a rare subtype with a higher pathogenicity of HCoV-NL63, a variant recently reported in China to cause severe lower respiratory tract infection.
In general, when these HCoVs gain the ability to effectively transmit and maintain their continuous function in humans, their contagion or pathogenicity decreases.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from the lung of a 60-year-old lame patient who had been diagnosed with acute pneumonia and pneumonia.
Although most of the confirmed laboratory cases began in the Middle East, there have also been a number of imported cases and occasional secondary outbreaks of close contact in Europe and Tunisia.
A second-degree outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015, in which 186 cases were confirmed.
Clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to SARS, known as acute progressive pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients find a severe lack of pollen, which is unique to MERS among HCoV-infected diseases.
More than 30 percent of patients have deficiency symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory confirmed cases with a very high mortality rate of 34.4% have been reported, making MERS-CoV one of the most harmful viruses known to humans.
In mid-to-late December 2019, clusters of pneumonia patients were observed in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, which has now been identified to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has described the spread of SARS-CoV-2-induced lower respiratory tract infections as a health concern for the public in the international dimension, calling the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 9,0053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a death rate of 3.4%.
It should be noted that in Hubei, China’s mortality rate is 4.2%, while abroad it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV, causes a severe respiratory infection that manifests as fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Diarrhoea has also been observed in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can become acute respiratory syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the long homologation of the nucleotide sequence, they fall into two different clusters of phylogenetic trees.
SARS-CoV-2 is clearly less pathogenic than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but it is more transmissible.
Asymptomatic cases have been reported to SARS-CoV-2 and may help accelerate its spread around the world.
Comparing and finding differences between SARS-CoV-2 and six other HCoVs indicates a number of similarities and differences that are interesting.
First, the incubation period and the incubation period of the human coronavirus disease are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 represents the overall trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms ranges between SARS-CoV and the four common human coronaviruses (including HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, the SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits features that we usually see most during infection with the spread of HCoVs, including the presence of non-specific, mild, or even lack of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 may also be considered an example of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 continues to show interesting patterns that are indicative of both collectively spread human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV.
On the other hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of other human coronaviruses with a mass outbreak.
On the other hand, it is necessary to determine whether the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 will be reduced after it has been transmitted to different humans, as has been the case with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, SARS-CoV-2 can be identified in human samples as well as other human coronaviruses.
Whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, at least in some circumstances, plays an important role similar to that of SARS-CoV is still unclear.
It's also interesting to see whether SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a seasonal state, like the cases of human coronaviruses with a mass outbreak.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmission, pathogenicity and sustained spread after human transmission, will influence the final fate of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.
All four HCoVs are well adapted to humans with a mass outbreak that causes mild symptoms of the disease.
From another perspective, it may still be true to say that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be survivors of the old human coronavirus pandemic.
Human coronaviruses, which cause severe diseases in humans, and humans who have been infected with severe human coronaviruses, were excluded from the study.
Human coronaviruses need to replicate in humans enough to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that neutralize host-limiting factors.
In this case, the more persistent the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is, and the more people infected, the greater the chance of the virus adapting to humans.
If the virus is well adapted, it can be difficult to prevent transmission by quarantine or other methods of controlling infection.
For many years, four large-scale coronaviruses circulated among the human population, and in such individuals who had a malfunctioning immune system, they caused the consequences of normal collapses.
These animals don't need an animal shelter.
In contrast, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been well adapted to humans, and their transmission in humans is not stable.
They must keep and reproduce themselves in animal reservoirs, usually by means of one or more intermediate and reproductive hosts, seeking an opportunity to move to sensitive human destinations.
SARS-CoV-2 has features similar to SARS-SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four more common human coronaviruses.
Just like human coronaviruses with a mass prevalence, at least for now, have high transmissibility.
However, it is more pathogenic than the common coronavirus, except that it is less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
Whether it fully adapts to humans and moves between humans without the need for a reservoir or intermediate animal host will be determined in the future.
Before discussing the animal origins of human coronaviruses, it is best to talk about the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and replicator hosts of human coronaviruses.
An animal is considered to be the evolutionary host of a human coronavirus if it is sheltered by a close, homologous ancestor at the level of a nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted to the host and is non-pathogenic.
In the same way, the host maintains the reservoir continuously and for long periods of time.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and act as the natural host of the human coronavirus or its parent virus.
On the other hand, if the HCoV is transmitted to an intermediate host recently, before or around the same time as being introduced to humans, it does not fit well with the new host and is often a petogen.
The intermediate host can act as an animal source for human infection and play the role of a replicating host, which allows the virus to proliferate temporarily and then pass on to humans to increase the scale of the infection in humans.
A human coronavirus, if it fails to maintain its transmission in the intermediate host, ends its transmission as a dead-end infection.
Conversely, human coronaviruses can adapt to the intermediate host and even cause long-term endemic disease.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
The re-examination of epidemiological data revealed that the SARS index had a history of contact with predatory animals.
A subsequent review of the outbreak found that the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV immunoglobulin was higher in animal traders than in the general population.
Masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and a raccoon dog were first identified in live animal markets as carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses that are nearly identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly proved by the fact that after all the civets in the market were killed, which other SARS incidents were not reported.
However, masked palm civets in wild or farms that had no contact with live animal markets were generally negative for SARS-CoV interactions, in other words, it could be concluded that masked palm civets act only as an intermediate host of the virus, rather than as a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Notably, since 80% of the different animals in the markets of Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that multiple species of small mammals act as intermediate SARS-CoV proliferating hosts cannot be ignored.
It turns out that all of these are the ultimate hosts of SARS-CoV.
The search for the natural animal host of SARS-CoV led to the discovery of a closely related bat CoV called the Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) and is present in Chinese horseshoe bats.
The antibody test for SARS-CoV and the sequence of the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 gene were positive in these bats.
This and other bat coronaviruses have 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
The studies established a new concept, meaning that bats host emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) have also been identified from bats, but none of them can be isolated as living viruses except for a virus called WIV1.
Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 was found to use bats, bats, civets, and humans as receptors to enter the cell.
Interestingly, the serum of patients recovering from SARS was able to neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the closest ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, which shares 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high homology between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not an intermediate parental virus for SARS-CoV, and bats are not the first reservoir hosts for SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis clusters MERS-CoV in the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
CoV-HKU4 bat and MERS-CoV both use a similar host receptor, called dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
The RNA-dependent polymerase sequences for MERS-CoV are phylogenetically closer to the bat-bita-CoV variants identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, which MERS-CoV has not been found alive in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest bat relative CoV-HKU25 have only 87% of the same nucleotide sequence homology.
Therefore, bats may not be the first host of the MERS-CoV reservoir.
Studies in the Middle East, on the other hand, have shown that camels are positive for MERS-CoV-specific serum neutralizing antibodies, such as camels of Middle East origin found in several African countries.
Live MERS-CoV, similar to the virus found in humans, was taken from a camel's nose sample of a comet, which suggests that camels play the role of a true MERS-CoV reservoir host.
It should be noted that, in general, camels who had been tested for MERS-CoV were found to have mild but severe viral replication.
It should be noted that camels transmit the virus not only through the respiratory tract but also by the fetal-hepatic pathway, which is also the main method of transmission of the virus in bats.
However, questions remain, since many cases of MERS did not have any history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, it can be concluded that the disease was transmitted from person to person or through unknown animal methods and species that carried MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a nucleotide homology of as much as 96.2% with the RaTG13 bat coronavirus isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
Like the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the divergence of the sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to account for the parental relationship.
In other words, bats may not be the first host(s) of the SARS-CoV-2 reservoir unless almost similar bat coronaviruses are found in the future.
Possibly, intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 should have been between wild species that are sodaed and killed in the Hunan seafood wholesale market, with many of the early cases of COVID-19 being associated, indicating a possible animal-to-human transmission event.
Several new studies based on metagenomic sequences have shown that a small group of endangered mammals called Pangolin (Manis javanica) could also be the ancestral origin of SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
These new pangolin-CoV genomes share 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are similar to RaTG13 at about 90 percent nucleotide sequence level.
They form as two sublingual lenses of SARS-CoV-like viruses in the phylogenetic cluster tree, which are more similar to the receptor binding domain (RBD) than SARS-CoV-2, and have a 97.4% similar amino acid sequence.
Contrastably, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, though they are more consequential in terms of genomic homology.
A previous study on sick pangolins also reported the detection of viral cantigas from lung samples, which were found to be similar to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used different collection methods and manual selection to create a partial genome sequence that contained about 86.3% of the length of the viral genome supplement.
We cannot ignore the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, due to the divergence of the sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs in Pangolin, there is currently no evidence that pangolin has a direct origin for SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs in Pangolin.
The evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals should be determined.
While the longest homologous adaptation has been found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the longest homology sequence at the genome level.
The high rate of similarity between SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV RBDs in Pangolin and SARS-CoV-2 is believed to have been formed by convergent evolution through mediating selection.
A reciprocal proposal is in favor of a recombination between a beta-pangoline coronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
The recombination is promoted as a driving force of evolution among the coronaviruses.
As to the immediate animal origin of SARS-CoV-2, research is still underway and cannot be said for sure.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, HCoV-229E, animal origin HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence suggested that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E both may have originated from bat coronaviruses, while the parent viruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in rodents.
A bat coronavirus known as ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in North American tricolor bats has been reported to be closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another bat coronavirus, Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, where camels are believed to be the intermediate hosts.
For more clarity, the current knowledge is summarized in relation to the animal origin of human coronaviruses known in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for interspecies transmission events of HCoVs throughout history.
When HCoV-OC43 was transmitted between species in 1890 to be transmitted from domestic animals to humans, a respiratory system pandemic was recorded.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is not known.
Bat alpha-CoVs have been found to be closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
Among them is an alpha-Alpaca coronavirus.
Numerous evidence supports the importance of transmitting the virus directly from bats to humans.
First, humans may come into contact with bats, not alpacas, because of their common niche ecology.
Humans, on the other hand, are closely related to alpacas.
Second, bat alpha-CoVs linked to HCoV-229E are diverse and non-contagious in bats, while alpaca alpha-CoVs caused the outbreak of respiratory illness in infected animals.
Finally, in wild animals, which case of alpha-alpaca coronavirus has not been found.
Therefore, the possibility of alpacas getting alpha-CoV-related HCoV-229E from humans cannot be ignored.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Handra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats may have transmitted HCoV-229E directly to humans.
On the other hand, although bat alpha-CoVs act as the genetic reservoir of HCoV-229E, alpacas and amphibious camels can act as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, as happened with MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of cross-species transmission from bats to one-climbing camels and later to humans.
In the early identification of MERS-CoV, bats were found to be the origin of the disease's evolution, and later findings confirmed this.
It is clear that bats are a rich source of viral species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Long lifespans, conjoined colonies, close social interactions, and a strong ability to fly are all ideal conditions for bats to "distribute the virus."
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been deployed in camels for decades.
The virus is well adapted to these camels, which have evolved from an intermediate host to a constant, natural reservoir host.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and its mutation rate is relatively low in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is a coincidence, and humans are the hosts of MERS-CoV impasse because its transmission between humans cannot continue.
Compared to the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins – if at all – is different in SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are very pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be the dead-end host of SARS-CoV-2-related alpha-CoVs, similar to civets associated with SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans should be confirmed or ruled out in future studies.
First, bats can host the reservoir of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus, which is similar to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may share a niche with bats through work in butchers or mines.
Secondly, pangolins can be one of the intermediate-replicating hosts to which SARS-CoV-2-related virus has recently been inserted.
Humans are infected with this virus through butchering and consumption of hunting meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be exposed to SARS-CoV-2.
A research on domestic and wild animals is needed to investigate antibodies.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species that has come into contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still underway.
Along with different types of animal hosts, there are three main factors of the virus that facilitate crossing interspecies barriers to coronavirus.
First of all, their relatively high rate of genetic mutation during RNA replication.
"Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, depending on the phase of coronavirus adaptation to new hosts, the estimated mutation rate for coronaviruses can be considered "average" to "long" based on a replacement rate of approximately 10–4 inches per year in place 2.
The coronavirus has an unreadable exoribonuclease, and its elimination leads to the occurrence of mutation and a very long or even weakening of it.
Interestingly, a nucleotide analogue called rhemodyvir is known to suppress the process of coronavirus proliferation by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the best spices to fight SARS-CoV-2, which should be tested clinically.
However, coronavirus mutation rates are about a million times higher than their hosts.
In addition, mutation rates are usually high when the coronavirus is not well adapted to the host.
Compared to the high mutation rate in SARS-CoV, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly lower, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It is likely that it has already adapted to another host that is closely related to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this is also true for MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to camels.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that the genetic drift could quickly neutralize SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and antivirals.
Secondly, the large RNA genome in coronaviruses increases flexibility in genomic modification for mutations or recombination, thereby increasing the likelihood of interspecies co-evolution, which contributes to the emergence of the new coronavirus when conditions are ready.
This is supported by many unique open reading boards and protein functions that are fertilized to the end of the 3<0xE2><0x80><0xB2><0xE2><0x80><0xB2> genome.
"Thirdly, coronaviruses, through a mechanism of 'copy selection', convert patterns randomly and repeatedly during RNA replication."
In a host that acts as a mixing pathway, string transformation occurs frequently during the transcranial RNA of the coronavirus.
RNAs with long homogeneity and complementary and sub-genomic length can be combined to produce new coronaviruses.
Natural recombinant phylogenetic evidence was found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
The interaction between the host and the virus in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor affecting interspecies transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is considered a promoter example and has shown evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Based on a comparative analysis between human SARS-CoV and civet isolates, it turns out that SARS-CoV quickly adapts to different hosts, especially through mutation in RBD and protein S.
Generally, RBD in protein S interacts with the cell receptor of a coronavirus and is strongly selected by the host's antibody reaction.
The RBD present in SARS-CoV is found in amino acids 318 to 510 on the S1 segment, which causes human ACE2 bonding as well as common receptors for virus entry.
The SARS-CoV receptor binding domain is capable of detecting ACE2 receptors from various animals, including bats, zebras, mice, and dog raccoons, allowing interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed, with RBDs differing between isolated viruses from humans and civets, and 4 of them in the receptor binding motif for interaction with ACE2 receptors.
SARS-CoV has two mutations, K479N and S487T, in its RBD, which may increase the reliance of spike proteins on human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions can play a vital role in viral adaptation to humans.
It should be noted that the cell receptor of SARS-CoV-2 is identical to SARS-CoV.
A 30-percent difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV per unit S1 of protein S suggests that the tendency to link its S protein to human ACE2 may have evolved.
In fact, a cryo-EM study showed 10 to 20 times longer linkage than the link between the ACE2 protein and the SARS-CoV-dependent S protein.
It will also be interesting to determine which other assistive receptors are necessary for transmission compared to the high mutation rate in SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also linked to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), but with a different part of S.
There are many other human coronavirus receptors, including aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-Cialic acid acetate for HCoV-OC43.
This could be the reason for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans after interspecies transmission from the host animal.
In addition to cell receptors, the result of interspecies transmission of HCoVs is influenced by other dependencies on the host and restrictive factors.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and reservoir hosts of human coronaviruses, such as bats, ostrich camels and rodents, can form a barrier to interspecies transmission.
For a successful interspecies transmission, human coronaviruses must take host dependency factors and suppress host restrictive factors.
In this regard, the molecular determinants in this important field of virus-host interaction should be identified and identified.
An unbiased screening across the genome of host dependency and restrictive factors for SARS-CoV-2, using advanced CRISPR technology, may be fruitful.
The Rise of the New Human Coronavirus: Return to Zero Point
The diversity of bat coronaviruses provides ample opportunities for the emergence of new human coronaviruses.
Based on this, bat coronaviruses act as a genetic source of human coronaviruses.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also trigger the evolution of the human coronavirus and serve as two important steps in the process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein fertilizer genes could significantly modify viral phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV side proteins, ORF8 appears to be important in adapting to humans, as bat viruses associated with SARS-CoV were isolated, but it was found to fertilize divergent ORF8 proteins.
A characteristic 29-nucleotide deletion of SARS-CoVs was found in isolated breeds at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This removal divides ORF8a and ORF8b into ORF8a and is a type of adaptive mutation that facilitates movement between hosts.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have had a history of recombination between alpha- and gamma-CoV linings, according to which a large number of smaller recombinants were identified in RNA-dependent polymerase.
Recombinant positions were also identified in nsp9, most of nsp10, and nsp14 components.
Similarly, it has been found that in the MERS-CoV epidemic, there were a number of recombinations between different linages that occurred in camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events have also been observed in other human coronaviruses where human coronaviruses recombine with other animal coronaviruses in their nonstructural genomes.
It should also be cautioned that artificial selection could play a role in creating unwanted conversions in viral genomes, which are likely to result from the virus being released from selective pressures, for example by the host's system.
An example of this effect is the loss of the full length of ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype due to the removal of two nucleotides.
Although healthy ORF4 can be found in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, alpha alpaca coronavirus has a nucleotide insert leading to mutation of reading boards.
In recent times, the evolution of emerging human coronaviruses is also advancing with the pressure of choice in their reservoir hosts.
When bats were infected with the coronavirus, cases were detected asymptomatic or with mild symptoms, indicating a reciprocal adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
It turns out that bats adapted well to the coronavirus, both anatomically and physiologically.
For example, a deficiency in activating the primary inflammatory response in bats effectively reduces the pathology activated by coronaviruses.
In addition, the activity of the natural killer cell in bats is suppressed due to the increased production of NKG2/CD94 inhibitor natural killer cell receptors and low levels of expression of the original adaptive tissue complex molecules.
In addition, high levels of compounds containing active oxygen (ROS) from long-acting metabolic activity of bats can simultaneously suppress the spread of the coronavirus and affect the high exoribonuclease, resulting in selective pressure to produce strains of the virus that have long effects when they enter a new host.
Longer pathogenic strains of coronavirus also evolve with recombination, leading to new proteins or protein properties to adapt to the host.
So, it's no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have emerged in the last two decades.
Coronaviruses are not pathogens or cause very mild misalignment in their reservoir hosts, such as bats and camels.
They reproduce vigorously without creating a strong feedback response from the host.
Here are some puzzles as to why asymptomatic carriers are observed and what causes severe cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are usually due to overactivation of the cytokine and cytokine storm, where the stronger the reaction, the more severe the damage to the lungs.
In contrast, in asymptomatic vectors, the response is isolated from the proliferation of the coronavirus.
The same strategy to isolate the response may have a positive effect on anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatment.
The interferon response in bats is particularly strong.
Therefore, the use of interferon-type I should be useful in humans, at least in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In addition, the activation of inflammasome NLRP3 in bats is defective.
With this logic, inhibiting inflammation of NLRP3 with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same general form that created SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although the beta-CoV with SARS-CoV has 95% nucleotide homology, there is a bat coronavirus with 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While civets and other animals on the market are known to host SARS-CoV-like viruses, the first intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 is not known.
The pangolin beta-CoVs discovered, surprisingly homologated with SARS-CoV-2, suggest that pangolins may have acted as one of the intermediate hosts, or pangolin beta-CoVs may have played a role in the genome fragments that made the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although the question remains, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally created by humans.
Coronaviruses have returned to the spotlight due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has significantly transformed our understanding of the importance of animal origin and animal reservoirs of human coronaviruses in its transmission to humans.
Evidence suggests that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats and were transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Considering that the SARS-CoV infection originated from contacts between humans and civets in the market, the closure of trekking markets and the killing of civets could effectively end the SARS epidemic.
With the same logic, given the discovery that multiple lenses of the pangolin beta-CoV are closely related to SARS-CoV-2, pangolins must be collected from traction markets to prevent animal transmission.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other animals will be determined in future research.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been present in mountain camels for a long time.
These camels serve as an important means of transportation and continue to be a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local population.
They have spread widely in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is practically impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, similar to what happened to control the outbreak of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in conjunction with wild animals on the Chinese market.
To stop MERS from spreading again, camels must take a holistic approach to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV, as well as take all necessary measures to control infection.
Because we can't eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may emerge and cause outbreaks.
Several types of animal coronaviruses are circulating in the wild.
Specifically, bat coronaviruses are very diverse with the possibility of transmission from animal to human.
There are many opportunities for these animal coronaviruses to evolve or recombine, leading to the emergence of new coronaviruses that will be more transmissible and/or lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China must be forgotten to reduce the amount of unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
Due to the calamities caused by SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be developed.
In fact, many viruses have existed on this planet for a long time.
They stay in their natural reservoirs until they have the opportunity to spread.
Although bats have many characteristics that contribute to the spread of viruses, if people are trained enough to stay away from these animals, human contact with bats and other wild species can be minimized.
Continuous monitoring in mammals is essential for better understanding the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural hosts, which will be useful in stopping their transmission from animals to humans and their future outbreaks.
As a conclusion, the most effective way to stop transmission of the virus from animals to humans is to keep humans away from the habitats of natural reservoirs of animal-to-human transmission viruses.
Several pieces in the puzzle of the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to see under what conditions bats and pangolins can share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a direct role in human transmission, the way humans interact with bats should be determined.
Third, if a third mammal acts as a real intermediate host, the way it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolins, should be determined.
Finally, given that many mammals, including domesticated animals, may have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be made.
Whether this occurs in a bat, a pangolin, or any other mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or its parent viruses, which are almost identical, are expected to be found in their natural host in the future.
Continuous research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, along with important interpretations related to the duration and control of COVID-19 in humans.
"Appointment of COVID-19 diagnostic criteria for 'suspected case' and 'confirmed case' is essential"
On February 6, 2020, our team released a quick guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of the 2019 novel coronavirus infection (2019-nCoV), and this guide provided our experience and provided a good reference for fighting this pandemic around the world.
However, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, and our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience. Therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment in conjunction with our guideline and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for a suspected and confirmed case in accordance with the latest COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines (7th edition) provided by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China.
In December 2019, the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) has led to an outbreak of a pandemic that is now officially named as the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) and the virus as severe acute respiratory syndrome.
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick recommendation guideline that was published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
This has attracted a lot of attention since publication.
Note that COVID-19 is a new disease, based on ongoing research findings and clinical experience, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing. Therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, the COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Procedures issued by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, have been published in a total of seven editions, some of which have changed the provisions of the basic procedure.
Now that our guideline has received a comment from Zhou and colleagues, they made a simple scoring proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work adds new evidence to our guide and continues to provide valuable references to the pandemic around the world.
We acknowledge their remarkable efforts and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment procedures (the seventh trial version) and recent studies, their work also needs to be updated.
According to the 7th edition (March 3, 2020), to confirm a suspected case, each feature of the history of the epidemic must be combined with two clinical symptoms so that a comprehensive analysis can be made, or in the absence of an epidemic history, it must have three clinical symptoms:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and its surrounding areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have actually been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infected persons with SARS-CoV-2 (positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and other pre-existing communities.
Clinical symptoms: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms. (2) have imaging characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) the total number of white blood cells is reduced at the beginning stage of normal count classification, or decreased lymphocytes.
The confirmed diagnosis should be based on the suspected case with one of the following pathogenic or cirological cases: (1) the real-time PCR test is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the total sequence of the virus that shows a higher level of remission with the new homogeneous coronavirus; (3) the positive result for specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in the Cerrum test; or the antibody conversion.
We can see that the momentary PCR test for nucleic acid in the respiratory system or blood sample has been added to the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) versions.
A pathogenic blood sample diagnosis was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) versions, and then the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These modifications are based on the researchers' ongoing efforts to search for an optimal nucleic acid diagnostic kit for rapid detection, as well as samples from the respiratory system, including blood sampling, leading to the emergence of verified metrics with increased availability of different samples and greater support for reliance on positive antibody results.
In addition, there is more and more evidence that warns us to treat patients with or without abnormal symptoms with caution.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou and colleagues should be updated, as they classified the person without clinical symptoms as low-risk.
The points system should also be further approved in clinical practice and studies.
In the end, we hope more direct evidence is available and we ask readers to give their opinions.
To diagnose a suspected and confirmed case, we suggest that you follow the latest guidelines from your country.
Our team will continue to update the guide to provide help, on time.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest in a single day
Yesterday, Bangladesh announced five deaths in one day from COVID-19.
This is the highest death toll due to the virus in one day.
Yesterday, the Bangladés Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported 114 manganese and 33 complementary recovery events at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online news report, IEDCR’s director, Dr. Mirjadi Sabrina Flora, said the dead were four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Mirjadi, two were over 60, two were between 51 and 60, and one was 41 to 50.
He also said that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on 11 March.
A hospital official told a local news agency called the Anadolu Agency that one of the dead was Jalal Sifur Rahman, the head of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who had been monitored at the Kuwaiti Maitree Hospital.
Obeid al-Qadir, Bangladesh’s minister of road transport and bridges, said in an online video announcement on Saturday that civilian transportation will be on holiday longer than originally planned by next Saturday.
The public transport holiday began on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of essential goods — medical, fuel and food — was still permitted.
The first case of Covid-19 was seen in Bangladesh on March 8, with two people returning from Italy and the wife of one of the two men.
On March 19, the three had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 affects more than one million people worldwide.
On Thursday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, the number of SARS-CoV-2 patients worldwide exceeded one million.
At least 52,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19, a coronavirus-related disease.
The turning point was the day Malawi announced its first coronavirus infection, and Zambia reported its first death.
On Thursday, North Korea claimed to be one of the few countries to have been freed from the coronavirus.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 105,1635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 in the 24 hours before 10 a.m. Central European Time (0,800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 coronavirus cases were recorded, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
CBC News, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, reported that more than 1,000 people died on Wednesday from coronavirus in the United States.
Around the world, countries are taking specific measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city's closure until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that the Russians would be paid by April 30 without working.
The Portuguese parliament extended the state of emergency for 15 days, resulting in 215 votes for, 10 abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia announced all day long curfews in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina; earlier curfews were only enforced between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand has been ordered to implement a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the government had extended the stay-at-home order until May 1.
Stores in Australia have lowered restrictions on the sale of toilet paper per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, the Australian retail chain Woolworths and Coles cut their shares of paper to two and one pack for each purchase at all stores in the country, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI announced a purchase restriction for only one package.
The restrictions were placed as messages in the payment box and on the Facebook pages of the stores.
It has been reported that buyers who store soda due to fear of COVID-19 and its abstraction.
On Wednesday, Woolworths continued to limit the purchase of toilet paper to one package per order.
These conversions followed the previous four packages for each transaction limit introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles supermarkets reported in a media interview on March 8 that, despite a four-pack limit, "many stores will reach complementary sales within an hour of delivery," calling demand "unprecedented," while ALDI chain stores, in their Facebook post on Tuesday, called sales "unexpected."
"According to Woolworth's spokesperson, the sale went up with a 'twisted upwards'.
The Costco store in Canberra limited the amount to two packs last week.
To alleviate this shortage, Coles ordered larger packages to suppliers and increased the delivery times, Woolworth ordered additional storage, and Aldi stocked up for Wednesday’s special offer.
Rachel Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retail Association, said retailers were trying to increase inventory, but local authorities’ restrictions on the timing of the move made it harder.
He expects the costs of production to go up, as suppliers try to meet demand and have fewer specials.
On Tuesday, ALDI (Chain Store) announced that some stores will not be able to make special Wednesday sales following the early release of shares.
In a report by News.com.au, a small business expert, Dr. Gary Mortimer of Queensland University of Technology, said shops fill their inventory every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a bulky commodity that takes up a small amount of space. If sold, it emptys the large space of the shelves and causes a feeling of scarcity.
Rachel Zimmerman told ABC News, “Kolze and Woolworth believe that if there were enough goods on shelves, if there were enough products, such as toilet paper and sanitizer, you could probably minimize this shopping panic.”
Recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said their inventory had been exhausted on Wednesday.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, the producer of Clinx’s toilet paper, and Solaris Piper, the producer of the Sorbonne product, emphasized that they work 24 hours a day, seven days a week to meet the market’s needs.
Domain.com, which operates in the real estate sector, reported that when shoppers are on vacation due to a long Labor Day holiday and fewer auctions are held, some property vendors offer the first bidder a free toilet paper at Melbourne auctions.
Thursday's edition of NT News, a newspaper published in Darwin, included an eight-page annex printed for cutting and use as a toilet paper.
According to ABC Australia on March 3, shops were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, stating that they had no plans to impose purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products such as masks, sterilizers, dried fruits, powders and hand washing liquids are in high demand.
Similarly, outside of Australia, it was observed that Sunday afternoon British supermarket online Okado limited the purchase of toilet paper to two packs of 12.
The World Health Organization announces the COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to how far the disease has spread and not to how dangerous certain cases are, the World Health Organization noted the need to push governments to:
“All countries can still transform the course of this pandemic.”
Tedros Adhanom, head of the World Health Organization, believes that “if countries take action to diagnose, test, treat, isolate, track, and mobilize people to respond.”
"We are deeply concerned about the alarming levels of prevalence and severity of the disease, as well as the alarming levels of impulsiveness."
According to Dr. Tom Friedman, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic was “unprecedented.”
In a CNN statement released in February, he said, "except for influenza, which other respiratory virus has not been identified from the onset of symptoms to the ongoing global outbreak."
Ghebreyesus made a similar comment, saying: “We’ve never seen a pandemic caused by the coronavirus before.
“We have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time.”
The new situation, as a pandemic, follows the decision of the World Health Organization, which in January declared the outbreak a public health emergency on an international scale.
"Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Antibody Diseases of the United States, in connection with the outbreak, said, "Overall, things are getting worse."
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, leading to more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is a continuing pandemic of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2.
The outbreak was diagnosed in Wuhan, China on December 30, 2020, declared a national public health emergency and declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Approximately 36,000 people have recovered.
The death rate in China was estimated to be 4%, yet globally it ranged from 13.4 percent in Algeria to 0.08 percent in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Mixtures include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
From exposure to the virus to the onset of symptoms, it usually takes about 5 days, but it may vary from two to 14 days.
There is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for the disease.
Primary treatment is a form of treatment for symptoms and a supportive treatment. Recommended follow-up measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth while coughing, keeping distance from other people, and checking and quarantineing people who are suspected to be infected.
Authorities around the world have reacted to travel restrictions, quarantines, travel restrictions, workplace hazard controls and facility shutdowns.
The pandemic has led to a severe global socioeconomic disruption, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages of resources caused by the pandemic.
Schools and universities have been closed in 193 countries, either nationally or locally, affecting nearly 99.4% of the world's student population.
Misinformation related to the virus has been circulating online, and there have been cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other people of East and Southeast Asian descent and other areas that have seen many cases of the virus.
Due to reduced travel and heavy industry closures, air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province), reported pneumonia cases on 31 December 2019 with unknown cause, and investigations began in early January 2020.
The patients were mainly linked to the Hunan seafood wholesale market, so the virus is thought to originate from zoonotic (human-animal common disease).
The virus that causes the epidemic is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus with features very similar to bat coronavirus, pangolin coronavirus, and SARS-CoV.
From the initial group of cases reported in December 2019, it was found that two-thirds of the cases were linked to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Morning Post suggested that such an event, discovered on 17 November 2019 in a 55-year-old in Hubei Province, may be the first mantan event. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, given the decline in new cases in China, in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of cases has risen abruptly beyond China.
Important reports may not be reported in supplement form, especially in cases with milder symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases of the disease were reported among young people, and only 2.4 percent of all patients worldwide were 19-year-olds and younger. Patrick Valance, the UK government's top scientific adviser, estimated that 60% of the British population needed to be infected in order to achieve collective immunity.
The cases are related to the population who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose testing has been confirmed as positive in accordance with official protocols.
Since March 23, which country has not tested more than 3% of its population, and the official policy of many countries, including Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, has been to avoid testing for people with mild symptoms.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, as of January 23, about 86% of COVID-19 infections had been undetected, and that these undocumented infections were the source of the infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy was significantly higher than reported cases.
Initial estimates of baseline replication rate (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found it to be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not, the time from symptoms to death ranged from 6 to 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 feet have been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80% of deaths occurred in people over the age of 60, and 75% of them had previous underlying diseases, including heart disease and diabetes. Official cases of death from the COVID-19 pandemic are generally related to people who have been tested dead, whose COVID-19 testing has been declared positive according to official protocols.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 is much higher because it doesn't include people who die without testing, for example, at home or in a nursing home.
Initial data from Italy showed the death toll from the pandemic was 4-5 times higher than the official confirmed death toll from Covid.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed that "we know [the figure] is lower than the actual figure". Reports of unspecified numbers in the United States confirm these statements. This lesser estimate, in fact, often occurs in pandemics such as the H1N1 swine flu epidemic. The first confirmed death was reported on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside of mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines and the first outside of Asia on February 14 in France.
By 28 February, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were reported in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By 13 March, deaths had been reported in more than forty countries and territories on all continents except Antarctica.
These numbers vary in different regions and at different times, and things such as the number of tests performed, the quality of the treatment system, treatment options, the duration of the initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age, gender and public health affect them.
According to Johns Hopkins University, as of April 10, 2020, the global death-to-case ratio is 6% (97,039 out of 16,17204).
The numbers vary by region.
In China, the estimated death-to-case mortality rate of the disease decreased from 17.3% (people with symptoms starting for 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with symptoms starting after 1 February 2020). Other calculations include: mortality rate of the disease (CFR), which indicates the percentage of people who are diagnosed with an undiagnosed disease (CFR) and the percentage of people who are diagnosed dying from an IPH.
This statistic has no time limit and is subject to a specific community from infection to recovery.
A number of university researchers have tried to calculate this number for a specific population.
The Oxford University Applied Spice Center estimates that the fatality rate for the global pandemic as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The high estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the randomized COVID-19 test in Germany and the statistical study of the effect of this test on CFR estimates.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak of the outbreak and the final duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may vary by location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University acknowledged that the prevalence of infectious diseases, if not investigated, would remain unconverted for a while and decrease after the end of existing hosts.
"But now any reasonable prediction associated with the time of the end of this disease is almost impossible."
Zhong Nanshan, chief medical adviser of the Chinese government, said that if all countries could mobilize everyone to comply with WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus, “it could be over by June.”
"On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Health and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 was "expanding and likely to last a year or two."
"According to a study conducted by Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures" will be required until the vaccine is available (about 18 months or more)."
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University commented, "I believe it's unlikely that this complementary virus will disappear - because it's so contagious" and "may become a seasonal disease that re-emerges every year."
The severity of the re-infection of the virus depends on herd immunity to disease and its rate of mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively unspecific, and people with symptoms may be asymptomatic.
Two common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Symptoms with less prevalence include fatigue, respiratory swelling (pores), loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headaches, chills, vomiting, blood vomiting, diarrhea, or cyanose. The World Health Organization states that nearly one in six people become seriously ill and experience respiratory distress.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists symptoms as respiratory distress, persistent pain in the cage or feeling pressure, sudden dizziness, difficulty waking up and bruising of the face or lips; if these symptoms are present, immediate medical treatment is recommended. Further progression of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, then septic shock, and death.
Some infected individuals may be asymptomatic and not show clinical symptoms, but the results of tests confirm their efficacy, so researchers recommend that people who have close contact with these cases be closely monitored and monitored to prevent the spread of infection.
The proportion of asymptomatic patients in China was estimated to range from minor amounts to 44%.
Incubation period usually varies from one to fourteen days (the time between infection and the onset of symptoms); in the majority of cases it is five days. An example of uncertainty is the estimate of the fraction of people with COVID-19 who have lost their sense of smell at first 30% and later reduced to 15%.
Some details related to the outbreak of the disease have been revealed recently.
It is believed that, in the first stages, the virus spreads through close contact with the microbes that occur when you cough, sneeze, or talk, if you consider close contact between 1 and 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that when coughing without covering, droplets can range from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have suggested that the virus may also be transmitted through tiny liquid droplets that spread during speaking and remain suspended in the air for longer periods of time. Respiratory droplets may spread during breathing and during speaking, although the virus does not normally spread through the air.
These droplets may be inserted into the mouth or nose of people close to us and submerged into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), may cause respiratory discharge to spread through the air, resulting in airborne release.
If you touch a clear surface, such as a cover, and then touch your eyes, nose, and mouth, the disease may spread.
While there are concerns about the spread of the virus through feces, this risk is not so serious.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of a feminine transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious in the first three days after the onset of symptoms, however, it may also spread to others before the onset of symptoms and in the later stages of the disease.
The test is positive up to three days before the onset of symptoms, indicating that the transmission takes place before noticeable symptoms.
There are only a few reports of lab-approved asymptomatic cases, but asymptomatic transmission has been detected by some countries during research into contact tracing.
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not known how easily the disease spreads, a single person can usually infect two to three other people. The virus lasts from a few hours to a few days on surfaces.
Specifically, the virus has been found to be detectable for more than three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, one day on cardboard, and for more than four hours on copper.
But this turns based on humidity and temperature. The COVID-19 test has been positive for pets and other animals.
There is no documented evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities recommend that you wash your hands after contact with animals, just like when you touch other surfaces of the mantle.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus that was first detected in three people with pneumonia in Wuhan who suffered from low oxygen levels in their blood and respiratory problems.
All features of the novel coronavirus appear in other natural coronaviruses. Outside of the human body, the virus is killed with regular soap, as its protective layer dissolves in soap. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV.
The disease is thought to have a common zoonotic origin or disease between humans and livestock.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus is genetically related to the genus Betacoronavirus and forms a cluster under the genus Sarbecovirus (subtype B) with two strains of bat origin.
The virus has a 96% resemblance to the total surface of the genome with other bat coronaviruses (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one amino acid difference between pangolins and human viruses in certain parts of the genome sequence.
By comparing the total genome to date, there are 92% of the genetic material common between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove pangolins as intermediate hosts.
Viral infection can be temporarily diagnosed based on symptoms, although a definitive diagnosis is confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) or CT imaging.
A study comparing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with CT scans in Wuhan found that CT was more sensitive to PCR, though less specialized, and that many of its visual features overlap with other types of pneumonia and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that “CTs should not be used to screen or test for a front-line diagnosis of COVID-19.”
The World Health Organization has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was on January 17.
The experiment uses the inverse transcranial polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done on respiratory or blood samples.
The results of the usual procedure are presented within a few hours to a few days.
Generally, this test is done with a sponge sponge, although throat sponge may also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, which of these was not accurate enough for widespread use.
In the United States, a serological test is designed by Cellex, which has been licensed for emergency use only by authorized laboratories.
Distinctive imaging profiles in radiological and computer-generated (CT) images of people with symptoms included rounded glass turbulence and no subsequent effusions were observed.
The Italian Radiology Association is compiling an online database of stabilized imaging findings.
Because of its synchronization with other infections, such as adenoviruses, PCR imaging without final approval is limited to detecting COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the results of the Sadr Cage CT to PCR and showed that although imaging is less effective for the infection, it is sensitive and fast and can be used as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based twist neural networks were developed to detect the visual features of the virus in radiology and CT photographs.
Strategies for preventing transmission of the disease include maintaining general hygiene, washing your hands, not touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, coughing or sneezing in a napkin and quickly dropping a napkin in the trash can.
Those who may already have an infection are advised to wear surgical masks in public.
Physical distancing is also recommended to stop transmission. Many governments have restricted all non-essential travel to countries and regions affected by the virus.
However, in large parts of the world, the virus has reached a stage of spread in society.
This means that the virus is spreading between communities, and some members of the community do not know where or how they were infected. Care providers who may be taking care of the infected person are advised not to take any precautions, be careful when contacting and eye protection. Tracking individual contact records is an important method that health authorities use to determine the source of infection and prevent further spread.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments for this purpose has raised concerns about privacy, so much so that Amnesty International, along with more than 100 other organizations, have issued a statement calling for the restriction of such surveillance measures.
Numerous mobile apps have been deployed or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts have been working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as Bluetooth to connect to nearby users.
Users then receive a message asking if they have recently been in direct contact with a person with a positive COVID-19 test result. Misconceptions about how effective the condition is; for example, nasal rinsing and throat pulleys with mouthwash are not effective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, but various organizations are working to achieve it.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises people to wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when the hands are clearly dirty, before eating, after fining, coughing or sneezing.
Because the virus is killed outside the human body with regular soap, soap destroys its protective coating.
The CDC continues to recommend using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with less than 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
The World Health Organization recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected with a number of solutions (one minute exposure to disinfectants for stainless steel surfaces), including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% povidone iodine.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chloroxidine gluconate, are less effective.
According to the CDC, if a person is suspected of having COVID-19 or has been confirmed in a location such as his or her office or treatment center, all areas such as offices, health services, shared areas, common electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by patients should also be disinfected.
Health organizations have advised people to stop their mouths and nose with a handkerchief or elbow when coughing or sneezing, and to throw away their handkerchiefs immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for people who are likely to have been stenched because masks can reduce the volume and distance of respiratory droplets thrown when talking, sneezing, and coughing.
The World Health Organization has issued guidelines on when and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "wearing a mask can reduce people's desire to touch their face, which is the main cause of infection transmission, sitting by hand."
The World Health Organization has advised healthy people to wear masks only if they are at high risk, for example, taking care of COVID-19 patients, although it confirms that wearing masks may help people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage the public to wear face masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing a non-medical face mask made from fabric. In particular, China recommends wearing a one-time medical mask for healthy people, especially in close contact with other people, in close contact with 1 meter (3 feet or less).
Hong Kong recommends wearing surgical masks in public transport or crowded places.
Thai health officials are encouraging people to produce cloth face masks at home and wash them on a daily basis.
Czechoslovakia has banned public places without wearing a mask or covering their noses and mouths.
On March 16, Vietnam called on all to wear face masks while in public to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made wearing masks mandatory for those entering the grocery store.
Israel has urged all citizens to wear masks when in public.
Taiwan, which has grown to a production capacity of 10 million masks per day since mid-March, has made wearing masks essential for rail fleet passengers and intercity buses as of April 1.
In Panama, it is essential to wear a mask when you go out, and those who can’t afford to wear a face mask must make a mask at home.
Face masks were widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control measures aimed at reducing disease by minimizing contact between people.
Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and closures of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping malls.
People can maintain social distancing by staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using contactless greetings, and keeping distance from others.
Many governments have already made or recommended social distancing in quarantined areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum population in communities recommended by government agencies and health care organizations in the United States quickly fell from 250 people (if there were no COVID-19 cases in the region) to 50, followed by 10.
"As of March 22, 2020, Germany has banned gatherings of more than two people. Kahlan and those with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and malnutrition are targets for the high risk of this acute disease and its complications, and, as recommended by the CDC, should remain at home as far as possible in areas of mass prevalence."
The use of the term "social distancing" implies that individuals should share in complementary social isolation rather than encourage them to interact with others through alternative means. Some authorities have issued sexual hygiene guidelines during the pandemic."
This includes recommending limited sex to a partner who does not have signs and symptoms of the virus.
Covid-19-infected people and those suspected of infection are advised to self-quarantine.
Health organizations have developed detailed self-improvement procedures. Many governments have made or recommended self-regulation necessary for all populations living in sub-regions.
The most serious self-quarantine orders have been issued for high-risk groups.
Individuals who have been in contact with a person who has contracted COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region with widespread outbreaks have been advised to stay in the self-quarantine for up to 14 days from the time of the last possible contact.
Strategies to control the spread of a disease include limiting or decreasing the spread.
Restrictions are imposed in the early stages of the outbreak and aim to track and isolate people, as well as introduce other measures of disease control and vaccination to stop the spread of the disease to other people.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the onset of the disease, efforts go into a phase of mitigation: measures are being taken to slow the spread of the virus and reduce its effects on the health system and society.
A combination of restriction and mitigation measures may be applied at the same time.
Suppression of the disease requires stricter measures to reduce the baseline proliferation rate of the pandemic to less than 1. Part of the management of the pandemic is to reduce the peak of the pandemic, also known as flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of over-the-counter health services and gives them more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-recent interventions that may control the spread of the virus include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks and quarantine; general measures aimed at physical distancing such as school closures and cancellation of cumulative events; public subscription to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as cleaning surfaces.
Other countries have taken different measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea turned to public screenings and local quarantines and warned against the movement of people.
Singapore provided financial support for the individuals who quarantined themselves and imposed heavy fines for those who ignored the quarantine.
Taiwan increased mask production and imposed heavy fines for the hoarding of medical equipment. Simulations conducted in connection with the United Kingdom and the United States showed that epidemiological reduction (slowing rather than stopping epidemic speed) and downsizing (reversing epidemic speed) pose great challenges.
Optimal moderator policies may reduce peak demand for health services by two-thirds and half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and exceeding the capacity of health systems.
Suppression can take place, but it must continue as long as the virus is circulating among humans (or until the vaccine is made, whichever comes first), otherwise the virus will re-emerge and spread once a bit of strict action is taken.
Long-term intervention to deal with the pandemic has social and economic costs.
No specific antiviral drug has been approved for COVID-19, but efforts are underway, including from existing spice tests.
Receiving anti-dropping spices without a prescription, drinking fluids, and resting can be effective in relieving symptoms.
Depending on the severity, treatment with oxygen, intravenous fluids and auxiliary breathing may be necessary.
The use of steroids may exacerbate the mixing of the disease.
Several compounds, which were previously effective in treating other viral diseases, are currently being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said some “domestic and traditional incidents” could reduce complications from SARS-CoV-19.
Increasing the capacity and implementation of health care to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients by the World Health Organization has been described as a key step towards responding to the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) and the European Regional Office of the World Health Organization (WHO) have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health and treatment services to transform resources at different levels, from focusing laboratory services to testing COVID-19, canceling selective procedures where possible, isolation and quarantine of COVID-19 patients, and increasing special care capabilities with personnel training and increasing number of beds and ventilation machines.
There are different theories regarding the identity of the first person (named as Patient Zero).
The first known case of the new coronavirus may return to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei and China.
Within a month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei gradually increased.
Most of these were related to the Hunan seafood wholesale market, where live animals were also sold, and one theory is that the virus originated from these types of animals; or in other words, it has an animal (zoonotic) origin. A pneumonia cluster with an unknown cause was observed on December 26 and was treated by Dr. Zhangjian at the Hubei Provincial Hospital on December 27.
“On December 30, a group of doctors at the Wuhan Central Hospital alerted their colleagues in connection with a ‘similar SARS-like coronavirus’.
Eight of the doctors, including Li Wenliang, were questioned for spreading false rumours by the police, while another doctor, named IFAN, was reprimanded by his superiors for raising alarm levels.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public announcement on 31 December, notifying the World Health Organization.
A significant number of cases of unknown pneumonia were reported to health officials in Wuhan in early January, prompting investigations. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases nearly doubled every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, due to Chinese New Year commutes and the fact that Wuhan is one of the transport hubs and intersections of major railway lines, the virus spread to other provinces in China.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later official data showed that as of January 20, 2020, 6,174 people had symptoms. As of March 26, the United States surpassed China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died and more than 364,000 recovered.
In at least 200 countries and territories, at least one incident has been reported.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area restricted free movement and established border controls.
National responses include restrictive measures such as quarantine (under stay-at-home orders, shelter-at-home orders, or complete quarantine) and travel bans.As of April 2, approximately 300 million people in the United States, or about 90 percent of the population, are under some form of home quarantine, more than 50 million in the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa, and 1.3 million in India, are under home quarantine.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were subjected to some form of quarantine, two days later it reached 2.6 billion, about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report said the first case was on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jian, a cluster of patients with pneumonia with unknown cause, was diagnosed on 26 December and immediately on 27 December, his hospital reflected the matter to the Jiang Han Wuhan Center for Disease Control.
The initial genetic testing of patients on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of SARS-like coronavirus.
A public notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
The World Health Organization was informed on the same day.
“With the release of these notifications, police warned Wuhan doctors about the “distribution of rumours” associated with the epidemic.”
China's National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no "certain evidence" of human-to-human transmission of the disease.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign that Xi Jinping, the Chinese Communist Party's general secretary, later described as a "people's war" to contain the spread of the virus.
“At the time of the event described as the ‘most important quarantine in human history’, a health belt was announced on 23 January that stopped entry and exit to/from Wuhan and was extended to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting about 57 million people.”
The use of private cars was banned in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were closed in many areas.
Officials also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Later, another hospital, known as Leichenshan Hospital, was built to take care of additional patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China also converted 14 other centers in Wuhan, such as convention centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the government took further measures to contain the spread of COVID-19, including issuing health declarations for travelers and extending the spring festival holiday.
Schools and universities across the country have also been closed.
The Hong Kong and Macau regions have taken several measures, particularly for schools and universities.
Remote work measures have been implemented in several regions of China.
Travel restrictions were imposed inside and outside Hubei Province.
Public transport has changed, and museums across China are temporarily closed.
Public transit controls were put in place in many cities, and it is estimated that some 760 million people (more than half the population) faced some form of outdoor restrictions. After the outbreak entered its global phase in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from entering other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine on all international travellers arriving in the city.On March 23, China’s mainland had only one case of illness inside the country, five days earlier, by a traveler returning to Guangzhou from Wuhan.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the outbreak had stopped at home and that the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were eased in Hubei, except for Wuhan, two months after the mandatory quarantine was imposed.On 26 March 2020, the Chinese government announced that entry for residents and visa holders would be suspended from 28 March, and no details on how long the policy would last.
Those intending to enter China must apply for a visa at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government has encouraged business owners and factories to start operating on March 30, and has set up financial support packages for companies. The state council announced a public mourning day to be held as a three-minute national silence at 10:00 a.m. on April 4, coinciding with the King Ming Festival, although the central government online asked families to stay away from the new COVID-19 outbreak.
COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread from China to South Korea on January 20, 2020.
The country’s health and treatment agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, most of which stem from a rally in Daegu for the new religious movement called the Shincheonji Church of Christ.
Shincheonji supporters who visited Wuhan with Dagu are suspected of the virus’s origin.
As of 22 February, out of the 9336 followers of the church, symptoms were reported in 1,261 people, or about 13 percent.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, up from 3,150 on 29 February.
After three positive coronavirus tests were reported, all South Korean military bases were quarantined.
The timing of the flights was also affected, which is why they were transformed. South Korea’s program has introduced the largest and best organized program in the world, which has been successful in terms of screening the population for the virus and isolated individuals, as well as tracking and quarantining the people who came into contact with them.
Screening methods include mandatory self-reporting of symptoms associated with newcomers to international flights through mobile apps, ride-hailing tests for the virus, whose results are determined the next day, and an increase in testing capacity of up to 20,000 people per day.
South Korea's program is a success in controlling the spread of the disease despite the lack of quarantine of all cities. Initially, the South Korean community was bipolarized in response to President Moon Jae-in.
A large number of Korean citizens have signed a petition to prosecute Moon for what they consider to be mismanagement in managing the outbreak, while others have signed to praise his response.
South Korea reportedly had the lowest total of cases in a single day in four weeks on March 23.
On March 29, it was reported that as of April 1, all new arrivals from abroad will be quarantined for two weeks.
According to media reports, on April 1, South Korea received a request from 121 countries for aid in testing the virus.

Iran has allocated 5 trillion rials to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on 26 February 2020 that there was no plan to quarantine the affected areas of the virus and that only individuals should be quarantined.
Plans to curb outbound travel were announced in March, though heavy traffic between the cities of the country continued before the Iranian New Year.
Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. Iran became the epicenter of the spread of the virus after China in February.
Among the claims of covering up the spread of the virus in Iran, more than a dozen countries have attributed their cases to Iran as of February 28, suggesting that the spread may be more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government to date.
The Iranian parliament was shut down and 23 of its 290 members reported that their virus test was positive on March 3.
On March 12, the Human Rights Watch urged Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent and to continue to temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
In closed environments, such as detention centers that lack adequate medical care, the risk of the virus spreading is said to be higher.
On 15 March, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, the highest recorded in the country since the outbreak.
At least 12 politicians and officials responsible for Iran’s active or former government were killed by March 17.
As of March 23, Iran had 50 new cases per hour and one death from coronavirus.

It has also been suggested that U.S. sanctions against Iran may have a negative impact on the country's financial ability to respond appropriately to the outbreak.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCR) has called for a reduction of economic pressure on the countries most affected by the disease, including Iran.
On 31 January, coinciding with the positive announcement of the SARS-CoV-2 test for two Chinese tourists in Rome, an outbreak of the disease was confirmed in Italy.

A CNN report found that combining two factors in Italy’s lazy population and the inability to test all people who have been infected so far could cause high rates of death.
Britain’s response to the virus was initially echoed as one of the coldest affected countries, and by March 18, 2020, the UK government had not imposed any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government was criticized for its lack of speed and seriousness in responding to public concerns.On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson banned unnecessary travel and social contact, urging people to work from home if possible and avoid going to places like bars, restaurants and cinemas.

“The WHO compared this situation to the SARS outbreak in 2002-2004, in which Chinese authorities were accused of keeping information secret, which negatively impacted efforts to stop and limit the spread of the virus, and in the current crisis, the central government “organized information to prevent the epidemic before the solar New Year holiday.””
"On January 23, World Health Organization representative Gooden Galli, in response to the decision of the Central Authority to implement the Transport Ban in Wuhan, declared that "this was definitely not the WHO's recommendation" but that "the most important sign of the UN's commitment to containing this epidemic is the sixth-largest" and that it was the "unprecedented global public health situation" in China.
WHO Secretary-General Tedros Adhanom stated that PHEIC was “due to the risk of global emissions, especially in low- and middle-income countries and lack of efficient health systems.”
In response to travel restrictions, Tedros declared that "there is no reason for unnecessary measures that interfere with global travel and trade," and continued that "the World Health Organization does not recommend restricting trade and movement."
On 5 February, the United Nations called on the international community to share $675 million in funding for strategic preparedness in low-income countries, noting the need to help countries that "don't have the right system for diagnosing people infected with the virus or even with symptoms."
Tedros went on to say that “we are as strong as our weakest link” and called on the international community to either invest today or pay more later.” On 11 February, the World Health Organization announced the COVID-19 pandemic at a press conference.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to the use of “the complementary capacity of the UN system in response to the disease.”
As a result, the U.N. crisis management team took action to enable the coordination of the entire UN response and, according to the World Health Organization, they will be allowed to “focus on the medical response, while other agencies can implement their expertise in broader social, economic and evolutionary contexts of the outbreak.”
"On 14 February, the Joint Mission Team led by the World Health Organization to provide the International Health Organization and the World Health Organization in the desired position in China to help with internal management and assessment of the severity and extent of the disease" by conducting workshops and meetings with national institutions and conducting field visits to assess the "impact of response activities at the provincial and county/country levels including rural areas" should be activated by the World Health Organization's declaration on 25 February.
"In response to this growing outbreak in Iran, the World Health Organization sent a joint mission team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the global coronavirus threat assessment would increase from "high" to "very high."
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the World Health Organization’s Emergency Situations Program, warned in a statement, “This is a reality for all governments in the world: Wake Up.”
“The virus is coming, and you need to be prepared, noting that the right response can help the world avoid ‘worsening it’.”
"The current data does not guarantee that public health officials will declare a global pandemic because such an announcement means that we will necessarily accept that every human being in the world will be infected with the virus."
On 11 March, the World Health Organization declared the spread of the coronavirus a global pandemic.
"The WHO is "really concerned about the alarming levels of prevalence and severity of the disease and the alarming levels of impunity," the WHO has received a lot of criticism for what appears to be inadequate control of the pandemic, including the delayed notification of the state of public health and the classification of the virus as pandemic.
The political response included a petition for the director-general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom, to propose his resignation, which had been signed by 733,000 people since April 6.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts emphasized respect for the rights of individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The team of experts stated that salvage measures should be provided to all and that the responsibility for this is the responsibility of the government.
The group stressed that lack of financial means or lack of health insurance should not justify discrimination against a particular group of people.
The experts emphasized that everyone has a right to health, including persons with disabilities, persons belonging to the cave, Kahlalan, indigenous people, the homeless, those living in extremely poor conditions, people in detention as well as refugees and others in need of government support.
International government agencies are managing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has set up a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information related to the policy of responses in countries around the world, as well as views and recommendations.
From policies strengthening the global hygiene and economic system to examining the effects of quarantine and travel restrictions, the digital hub includes pursuing a nationwide policy (how countries respond to this crisis) that aims to help countries learn from each other's experiences and facilitate a coordinated global response to the coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, British Cabinet Secretary Michael Gove and President Eduardo Bolsonaro, the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, for controlling the pandemic that began in China’s Hubei province.
A number of state executives of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were fired for their management in an attempt to quarantine in central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the political institution’s response to the outbreak in those areas.
Some critics believe the move was aimed at protecting Chinese Communist Party Secretary-General Xi Jinping from public anger at him in the coronavirus epidemic.
Some high-ranking Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijan, refused to be aware of the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak early on, which fueled U.S. and Italian conspiracy theories linked to China for the underlying cause of the COVID-19 outbreak.
The Trump administration in the U.S. has described the coronavirus as a "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus" and said that "censorship has caused a virus outbreak that has now become a global pandemic" which, in turn, has been met with criticism from some critics as racism and "didn't pay attention to the inefficiency of his administration in containing the disease."
“Daily Beast has acquired a cable network for communications measures from the National Security Council, which uses a strategy called ‘Everything is under China’.
“We are being asked to do our best and make this message public in every possible way, including news conferences and television interviews.” Reporters like Politico, Foreign Policy, and Bloomberg claimed that China’s efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of global propaganda.
EU foreign policy chief Joseph Burrell warned that “there is a geopolitical component involved in trying to influence by diverting attention and a “policy of generosity.”
Borrell continued, “China is desperately trying to show everyone that it is a committed and reliable partner, unlike the United States.”
China has also urged the United States to lift sanctions imposed on Syria, Venezuela and Iran to help them, while sending a lot of aid to the last two countries.
Jack Ma’s 100,000 masks were granted to Cuba on April 3 due to U.S. sanctions.

Masks disputes between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, have also been reported in the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey confiscated hundreds of ventilators to Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the EU for failing to cooperate with Italy affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italy’s ambassador to the EU, said only China reacted in a bilateral manner.
“Certainly, that’s not a good sign of European unity.”
On March 22, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin sent the Russian army to Italy to send military spices, special disinfectants and other medical equipment.
The Italian newspaper La Stampe said anonymously that 80 percent of Russia’s aid to Italy “was either useless or underutilized.”
"The source with Russia accused him of abusing the "geopolitic and diplomatic" conditions by his deceptive act."
Attilio Fontana, head of Lombardy and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi di Maio, rejected the media report and thanked the efforts.
Russia has sent a medical aid plane to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, “When we offered help to our colleagues in the United States, he assumed that when the manufacturers of medical equipment and products in the United States resumed their work, they would be able to help each other if necessary.”
NATO's planned "Defender 2020" combat exercises in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, the sheriffs of the war exercises, will be held on a reduced scale since the end of the Cold War.
"General Secretary of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson criticized Defender's 2020 performance: "In the current public health crisis, not only the lives of the American Asgar and many European countries are at risk, but also the lives of the citizens of the countries where operations are being conducted." The Iranian government has been severely affected by the virus, with nearly twenty-four members of the House of Representatives sick and fifteen of current or political figures.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani sent an open letter to world leaders asking for help on March 14, 2020, saying that his country is struggling to combat the spread of the disease due to the lack of access to international markets as a result of US sanctions against Iran. The outbreak has prompted the United States to adopt social policies that are common in other rich countries, including universal health, universal child care, paid family leave, and increased public health funding.
Political analysts predicted that the pandemic could negatively affect the chances of Donald Trump re-election in the 2020 presidential election and the relationship between Japan and South Korea.
"After Japan announced that it would quarantine all passengers arriving from South Korea for two weeks at locations designated by the government, South Korea criticized Japan for "empty and passively knowing the quarantine efforts."
The people of South Korea have been polarized since the beginning in connection with President Moon Jae-in’s reaction to this crisis.
A large number of Koreans signed petitions calling for the Moon to be impeached for something they claimed was the government's inefficiency in the outbreak, or praised his response. The pandemic has allowed countries to pass emergency legislation to implement appropriate responses.
Some commentators have expressed concern that this might allow governments to hold power tighter.
In Hungary, the parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule with an unlimited mandate, suspending parliament as well as elections, and punishing those who spread misinformation related to the virus and the administration of the state from the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has occurred due to several instances of material supply shortages, caused by increased use of equipment to combat the coronavirus outbreak, panic buying, and disruption to factory and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Post Food Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicine and medical equipment due to rising consumer demand and disruptions in suppliers.
Several areas continued to see an influx of public outcry for purchases, which led to the emptying of store shelves of essential goods such as food, toilet paper and water bottles, causing supply shortages.
In particular, the tech industry has warned of delays in sending electronic goods.
According to WHO Secretary-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100-fold.
This demand has led to a price increase of up to 20 times the usual price, resulting in a delay of four to six months in the supply of medical supplies.
There is also a shortage of personal protective equipment in the world, and the World Health Organization warns that it will jeopardize the health of workers.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Diago vendors to sell Australian products in China.
This activity in some supermarkets caused a shortage of infant formula, and the Australian government banned it. Despite the high number of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region and the high demand for food, none of the two regions suffered from severe food shortages.
The actions of China and Italy have been successful against the speculation and illicit trafficking of essential goods, and have also avoided the severe food shortages predicted in Europe as well as North America.
Production of crops in the northern regions of Italy, which produce the majority of crops, has not fallen significantly, but representatives of the sector say prices may go up.
Empty food shelves were created even in Wuhan, only temporarily, while high-ranking Chinese authorities opened pork barns to ensure adequate nutrition for the population.
Similar laws in Italy require food producers to store food for such unsafe situations.
Damage to the global economy was felt in China: According to a media report on March 16, the Chinese economy suffered a severe blow in the first two months of 2020 due to government action to halt the outbreak, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
Since mainland China is a major economic and manufacturing hub, the outbreak poses a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicted that markets would remain volatile until the situation of potential outcomes became clearer.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth may be greater than the SARS outbreak in 2002-2004.
According to Washington University expert estimates, the global supply chain will be affected by up to $300 billion, which will continue for two years.
“According to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), oil prices have “seriously fallen” due to China’s falling demand.”
World stock markets fell outside mainland China on February 24 due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On 27 February, rising concerns over the coronavirus outbreak led to an unprecedented drop in the NASDAQ-100, S&amp, P500 and Dow Jones industrial index, the largest drop in a single day since the 2007 financial crisis, with Dow Jones scoring 1,191 points.
All three indicators fell more than 10% at the end of the week.
On 28 February, the rating company GMHscope confirmed China’s credit rating but had a negative outlook.
Stocks have again fallen sharply due to fears of the coronavirus, with the largest fall due to March 16.
Many believe that economic recession is likely.
Economist Mohammad Al-Arian appreciated the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and countries.
Central banks reacted more quickly compared to the 2008 financial crisis.
Due to the restrictions imposed on travel, the closure of public places such as tourist attractions, and the advice of governments not to travel to other countries, the tourism industry is among the most disadvantaged.
As a result, several airlines have canceled flights due to lack of demand, including from British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while the British regional airline Flybe went bankrupt.
Its impact on the cruise ship industry was so great that it had never been seen before.
Several train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chunyan, whose main travel season is the Chinese New Year holiday.
National and regional governments have canceled a number of events, such as large-scale New Year’s celebrations, and private companies have independently shut down shops and tourist attractions such as Disneyland Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to prevent people from gathering, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, district and regional authorities extended the New Year's holiday until February 10, ordering most workplaces not to reopen on that date.
These regions represented 80 percent of domestic production and 90 percent of exported products.
Hong Kong increased its antibody response rate to the highest possible level, declaring an emergency, closing schools until March and canceling New Year's celebrations. The retail sector has been affected worldwide and their working hours have been reduced or they have been on temporary leave.
Retail visits in Europe and Latin America have fallen by 40%.
Sales in the Middle East and North America saw a 50 to 60 percent drop in sales.
This also led to a sharp drop in shop purchases in March compared to February.
The leaders of the world's major shopping malls took complementary steps, such as increasing compliance with health guidelines, installing thermal scanners to check buyers' body temperature, and cancelling events. According to the UN Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic is causing an absolute poverty of 14 million to 22 million people in Latin America, more than the number of people without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the pandemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people lost their jobs in China.
A large number of China's nearly 300 million rural migrant workers are trapped at home in offshore provinces or trapped in Hubei Province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought government assistance.
According to estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronavirus outbreak can affect up to 47 million jobs in the United States and lift the unemployment rate by up to 32%. Complementary quarantine in India has led to the unemployment of ten million Indian migrant workers (employed with an adjournment). The results of a survey conducted by the Angus Reed Institute showed that 44% of Canadian families had some form of unemployment since the mid-March 2020 lockdown in Spain.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits, and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit (Universal Credit). Approximately half of a million companies in Germany implemented short-term government-subsidized work plans called Corsarbit.
The German short-term work compensation program has also been accepted by France and Britain.
The active sectors of the performing arts and cultural heritage were heavily influenced by the negative aspects of the pandemic that affected the organization’s performances and that of individuals, including employees and independents, around the world.
Cultural and artistic organizations sought to support their mission (often with public funding) so that the public could access cultural heritage, protect the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists whenever possible.
By March 2020, all over the world, museums, libraries, venues and other cultural institutions, along with exhibitions, events and performances that had been canceled or postponed, were closed for an indefinite period.
In response, many efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and accelerator is in reducing disease, cancelling religious events, major sporting events and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The cinema industry has also been disrupted. The Vatican announced that the customs of the Holy Week in Rome, which should have been held in the Christian fasts last week, have also been abolished.
Many bishops have advised older Christians to stay at home instead of attending Sunday services; some churches broadcast church services via radio, online broadcasting, or television, while others recommend individual worship.
With the bishop of the Roman Catholic Church closing down its large and small churches and St. Peter’s Square empty of Christian pilgrims, other religious institutions have also canceled their services and restricted public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and shrines.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced that Friday prayers would be canceled due to the outbreak of the disease in the areas of Manhattan, and religious sites would continue to be closed, while Saudi Arabia banned its citizens from visiting holy sites in Mecca and Medina while preventing foreign pilgrims from entering.
This pandemic has caused the most significant interruption in sporting events since World War II.
Most major sporting events have been canceled or postponed, including the 2019-2020 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-2020 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the NBA season and the NHL season from 2019 to 2020.
"This outbreak also disrupted the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to start at the end of July; the IOC announced on 24 March that the event would "become a different date than 2020 but not after the summer of 2021". Casinos and other gaming venues around the world have been closed and live poker tournaments either postponed or cancelled."
This caused many gamblers to turn to online gambling, and many online gambling sites reported a significant increase in their entry rates. The entertainment industry has also been affected, and numerous music groups have suspended or canceled their concert tours.
Many large cinemas, including those in Broadway, have also suspended all their positions.
Some artists have explored ways to continue producing and sharing work via the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performances such as live streaming concerts or the creation of web-based "internet festivals" for artists to perform, distribute and advertise their works.
Online coronavirus-related trolls are spreading in the midst of this uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been strong prejudice, xenophobia, and racism towards Chinese and East Asian peoples, and against people in high-profile European countries, the United States and other countries.
Events such as fear, doubt and violence have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when most of the cases were still confined to China) showed the racist sentiments of numerous groups around the world that the Chinese people deserved the virus and what was claimed to be the right punishment.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported being discriminated against because they came from the area.
There have been online and non-online donations from areas affected by the virus in China.
Following the progress of the outbreak in countries with new high prevalence rates, Italians, the first country in Europe to experience the serious spread of COVID-19, can still be subject to suspicion and xenophobia from citizens of other countries. Citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to ban Chinese nationals from entering their country in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag <0x23>ChineseDontComeToJapan (Chinese native to Japan) was trending on Twitter.
People in China, as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States, have reported rising levels of racist insults as well as attacks.
"President Donald Trump has faced criticism for naming the coronavirus as a 'Chinese virus', a term that critics see as a sign of racism and anti-Chinese sentiment."
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses containing Ukrainian and foreign nationals from Wuhan and transported to Novi Senzhari.
Students from the northeastern region of India, which shares a border with China, and students studying in major cities in India, are reported to be fearful of the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Gogh, head of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s governmental division in South Bengal, stated that the Chinese destroyed nature and “that’s why God took revenge on them.”
"These remarks were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Calcutta and called 'mistakes'. In China, xenophobia and racism against post-pandemic non-Chinese citizens have intensified and foreign nationals have been deemed 'foreign junk' or have been said to be thrown into 'waste baskets'."
Many newspapers with paid sections have removed these sections to cover the news about the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have provided free scientific papers related to the virus outbreak.
Some scientists decided to share their results quickly on preprint servers like bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus includes two methods, methods that detect the presence of the virus and methods for detecting the presence of antibodies created in response to the presence of an infection.
The presence of viruses in samples confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This is a specific test and is only designed to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus's RNA.
It is used to confirm very new or active infections.
Antibodies (syrmology) can be used to diagnose both disease and population surveillance.
Antibodies test shows how many were infected, including those whose symptoms were so weak that they didn’t need to be reported or who didn’t.
The exact death rate of this disease and the level of herd immunity in the population can be determined using the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, by March 2020, which country had no reliable data on the spread of the virus among the population.
As of March 23, which country had not tested more than 3% of its population, and there is a huge difference in the number of tests conducted in different countries.
Conversionability is also likely to be significantly higher in reported cases, which are likely to be significantly over-estimated in some countries.
With the help of real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained in different ways, including from a swallow sponge or a bulldog sample.
Results are usually announced within a few hours or up to two days.
An RT-PCR test performed with a mere sampling of the throat during the first week of the disease is reliable.
The virus may disappear in the throat, although it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For the cases of men who were tested in the second week, the sample material can be obtained in exchange, from lower respiratory tracts, by suctioning the catheter or removing the bulge.
One of the first PCR designations was prepared in January 2020 by Charité in Berlin, where a real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was used, providing the basis for the construction of 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK has also developed a test as of January 23, 2020.The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical-grade SARS-CoV-2 identification kit based on PCR called PowerChek Coronavirus on January 28, 2020.
The "E" genus, which is present in all types of beta-CoVs and traces the RdRp genus, which is only present in SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group was the first company to obtain a generic PCR base identification kit for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
One of the three genetic tests in older versions of test kits was incomplete due to defects in the detector, causing the trials at the CDC in Atlanta to fail, causing the number of successfully evaluated samples to fall by an average of 100 per day throughout February 2020.
The reliability of the two-component tests was not determined until February 28, 2020, and state and local laboratories were allowed to begin testing as of this date.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization. US commercial laboratories began testing it in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp has announced that RT-PCR-based COVID-19 tests will be available across the country.
Quest Diagnostics also made COVID-19 testing packages available nationwide as of March 9, 2020.
Which quarantine restrictions were not announced; sampling and analysis should be done according to CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was designed and produced by the State Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health and Treatment Supervision Agency. On March 12, 2020, it was reported that the Mayo Clinic had produced a test to identify the infection with COVID-19. On March 13, 2020, the Roche Diagnostics company received a Food and Drug Administration approval for a test that could be done in about 3.5 hours and in a 24-hour volume, resulting in a single test.
On March 19, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for Abbott's system tests for Abbott Laboratories; the Food and Drug Administration had previously issued a similar authorization for Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific companies.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid received an EUA from the Food and Drug Administration for a 45-minute trial.
The Food and Drug Administration has approved a trial that uses isothermal nucleic acid booster technology instead of PCR.
Considering that it doesn’t require a single periodic temperature cycle, this method can give a positive result in just 5 minutes and a negative result in 13 minutes.
There are currently 18,000 of these machines in the United States, and Abbott plans to produce 50,000 tests a day by increasing production. There is currently an experiment in Taiwan that uses a monoclonal antibody, a substance that specially binds the protein nucleopsid (protein N) of new coronaviruses; it is hoped that this type of test can deliver a rapid test within 15 minutes, such as a fluff test.
"By March 2020, from a review of the records, it was concluded that "sudder cage radiographs are of little value for detecting disease in the early stages of the disease, while CT findings may even be present before symptoms appear."
Common features of CT include multi-faceted multi-faceted glass opacities with a lateral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution.
Subpleural dominance occurs with the evolution of disease, penetration, and atypical patterns.
A study in Wuhan compared the origins of the flu pandemic, PCR and CT, and declared that CT is significantly more sensitive compared to PCR, although less specialized and has many of its imaging features overlapping with other pneumonia and respiratory problems.
"As of March 2020, the recommendation of the American Radiology Academy was that 'CT should not be used for screening of the disease as the first line of testing to diagnose COVID-19.' As of March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR should be used for screening."
Part of the immune system's response to disease is to produce antibodies such as IgM and IgG.
These can be used to identify the disease in people, within 7 days or more after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity and for population surveillance. Examination can be done in central laboratories (CLT) or through a point-of-care (PoCT) test.
High-power automated systems in many laboratories will be able to perform these assessments, but access to them will depend on the production ratio for each system.
For CLT, a single blood sample is usually used, however, machine gun samples can be used to track the response of the paraphrased system.
For PoCT, blood sampling is usually achieved by piercing the cover.
Unlike PCR procedures, the extraction procedures do not need to be performed prior to the measurement. On 26 March 2020, the Food and Drug Administration introduced 29 companies that had notified the organization according to the requirements and thus were able to distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one single test has been approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorization.In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European licenses for their test kits; these kits can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The testing capacity of several hundred samples per hour is therefore much faster than the usual PCR assessment for viral RNA.
Antibodies are usually detectable up to 14 days after the onset of infection. In early April, the UK announced that none of the purchased antibody test kits were good enough.
"Hang Kang has set up a program in which those suspected of having STDs can stay at home, "The Emergency Medical Services will carry a sample tube to the patient," the patient will squeeze it into the patient's tube, send it back, and after a while receive the test result. The NHS in the UK has announced that it is testing on a plan in which the suspected cases are being tested at home.
Drive-through centers helped South Korea run one of the fastest and most comprehensive tests in the world. In Germany, the National Union of Legal Health Doctors announced on March 2 that it had the capacity to perform about 12,000 tests a day inside the ambulance, and 10,700 tests had been conducted in the week before.
Once the doctor prescribes the test, the health insurance will take care of the costs.
According to the head of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to conduct a total of 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, a number of major cities were offering test services on horseback.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests conducted in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were reported.
"The first laboratory study showed that up to the calendar week of 12.20<0xE2><0x80><0xB2><0xE2><0x80><0xB2>, a total of at least 48,3295 samples were tested, taking into account the week of 20.12<0xE2><0x80><0xB2><0xE2><0x80><0xB2>, and the SARS-CoV-2 test was positive for a sample size of 10,349 people (6.9 percent). In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rembame Hospital developed a method for sample testing of 64 patients simultaneously, in which all samples were combined.
The founder of BGI, Wang Jian, personally oversees the project, which lasted five days, and modelling found that if the capacity had not been added, the cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the cost of implementing the quarantine would have doubled.
After the Wuhan lab, Hu-Yan lab was quickly set up in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, a total of 12 cities across China.
As of March 4, 2020, the total daily output was over 50,000 tests. Open source and composite designs developed by Origami Assays have been published and can be used to test samples from 1,122 people for COVID-19, using only 93 tests. These balanced designs can be implemented in small laboratories without the need for liquid-operated robotic devices.
Until March, shortages and inadequate quantities of detectors were one of the bottlenecks of mass-produced testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led some researchers to look at sample preparation protocols, which included heating samples up to 98<0xC2><0xB0>C (208<0xC2><0xB0>F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for subsequent tests.
"This was done by combining the possibility of providing riding services and purchasing a large-scale population-scale sample lab from Group 42 and BGI (based on the Hu-Yan Emergency Identification Laboratories in China).
The lab, built in 14 days, is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests a day, making it the first of its kind to be operational outside of China.
Various testing procedures targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization (WHO) used German guidelines to produce kits for low-income countries that do not have enough resources to make the kit.
The German Directive was published on January 17, 2020; the U.S. Centers for Disease Control's Protocol was not available until January 28, delaying available testing in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits early in the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide enough kits to meet the demands and recommendations of health experts for testing.
On the other hand, experts say widespread access to testing in South Korea has helped reduce the spread of new coronaviruses.
Testing capacity, mainly in the form of private sector laboratories, was developed over the course of several years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that testing programs should be accelerated as the best way to slow the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing has led to hundreds of thousands of tests being held in private laboratories in the United States, and the supply of sampling supplies and chemicals has been difficult.
In March 2020, China reported that the country's manufacturing test kits were in trouble and were not accurate.
“In the United States, test kits made by the CDC had a ‘failure’; then the government removed administrative barriers that blocked private experiments. Spain purchased test kits from a Chinese company called Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd but found the results were incorrect.”
The company explains that incorrect results may be the result of not getting the right sample or using the test kit incorrectly.
Spain's defence ministry announced it would collect kits containing inaccurate results and turn them into a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy, with 80% of test kits purchased by the Czech Republic from China giving the wrong results.Slovakia has purchased 1.2 million test kits from China, which proved to be inaccurate.
"Prime Minister Matovi<0xC4><0x87> proposed to be poured into the Danube. Firekara, a member of the Turkish Ministry of Health, said the test kits Turkey bought from China had a "high error rate" and were "unused". The UK bought 3.5 million kits from China, but in early April 2020 it was announced that the kits were inoperable."
Testing along with quarantined people who had positive results and tracking people who had contact with infected SARS-CoV-2 led to positive gains.
Researchers in the Italian city of Vo', the site of the first recorded case of COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two phases of testing on all 3,400 people living in the city, about 10 days apart.
About half of the people with positive results did not have any symptoms and all of the cases were quarantined.
By limiting urban travel, new cases were eliminated in complementary fashion.
The 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has spread much more slowly than in other developed countries due to severe contact tracing, domestic travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, but no strict restrictions have been imposed, such as forced closures of restaurants and retail outlets.
Many events were canceled, and Singapore advised its citizens to stay at home on March 28, but schools reopened on March 23 after being closed.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have managed to tighten contact tracing, domestic travel restrictions, conduct tests and quarantines, but have had less stringent leave.
A statistical study found that countries that did more diagnostic tests than the death toll had much lower mortality rates, possibly because these countries were better able to identify episodic cases that only had mild symptoms or which did not have symptoms.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that countries that do not have the capacity to conduct tests and that laboratories have limited experience with COVID-19 send the first five positive and the first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the WHO's 16 reference laboratories for approval.
Out of the 16 reference laboratories, there are seven in Asia, five in Europe, two in Asia, one in North America and one in Australia.
“In the table below, the column ‘positive in % of tests’ is affected by the testing policy of each country.”
In very equal circumstances, a country that tests only people admitted to the hospital has more positive cases than a country that tests all citizens, regardless of the symptoms of the disease, in percent.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand hygiene, is what a person does to remove dirt, fat, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances on their hands.
"Washing hands with soap consistently throughout the day at "critical moments" prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by the path of the femur."
Also, if people don't wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (e.g. mucous membranes), they can be infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or a common fall.
There are five important times in the day to wash your hands with soap to reduce feminine-disease transmission: after going to the bathroom (sweat and flush), after cleaning the baby’s stomach (transforming the diaper), before feeding the baby, before eating, and before and after preparing food, or when touching raw meat, fish or poultry.
If soap and water are not available, you can wash your hands with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
Before, during and after meals.
Before and after taking care of a patient.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who has used the bathroom.
After emptying the nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, feeding them, and touching their waste.
Medical hygiene refers to health activities related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before using a medication or treatment measures can prevent or minimize the spread of the virus.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse your hands of petogenes (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause injury or disease.
This is especially important for people working with food or in the medical field, but it is also an important exercise for the general public.
Hand washing has many benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; as well as preventing diseases that lead to diarrhea; and reducing respiratory infections;
Reduced infant mortality rate in domestic births.
A 2013 study found that improved hand-washing procedures may lead to minor improvements in the average height growth of children younger than five years old.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates associated with respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by simple behavioral changes such as hand washing with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate in these diseases by up to 50%.
Interventions that promote hand washing are able to reduce diarrhea by about a third, equivalent to providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% of the reduction in diarrhea cases can be attributed to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and respiratory infections (ARI), as a routine practice in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, a major ARI, is the number one cause of death among children under five years old, which kills 1.8 million children each year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia are the leading cause of death for approximately 3.5 million children per year.
According to UNICEF, switching to handwashing before eating and after going to the bathroom can save more lives than any other vaccine or medical intervention, resulting in nearly half of diarrhea deaths and a one-quarter reduction in deaths from acute respiratory infections.
Hand washing is usually completed with other disinfectant interventions with water, disinfection, and individual health programs (WASH).
Hand washing also prevents the ulcer (impetigo) from being transmitted by direct physical contact.
The small detrimental effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can lead to velvety damage due to dry cover.
A study in Denmark in 2012 found that excessive hand washing can lead to itching and scaling of the cover, also known as eczema, and this is particularly common among health care workers.
Excessive hand washing is also known as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five important times in the day to wash your hands with soap to reduce feminine-disease transmission: after going to the bathroom (sweat and flush), after cleaning the baby’s stomach (transforming diapers), before feeding the baby, before eating, and before/after preparing food, or when touching raw meat, fish or poultry.
Other times in which hand-washing technique should be followed for the purpose of transmitting the disease, including before and after the treatment of wounds or injuries, after sneezing, coughing, or firing; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching waste.
In many countries, the rate of hand washing with soap is low.
A 2015 study linked to hand washing in 54 countries found that 38.7% of people wash their hands with soap. A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of hand washing with 97%, the United States near the school with a 77% rate and China with the lowest rate of 23%. Several methodologies of behavioral conversion in handwashing with soap are currently underway.
The “Critical Health Care Program” launched by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of measures to improve children’s health and education.”
Twice a year, along with daily hand washing, brushing the day with fluoride, is the most important point of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the cover is increased by the addition of soaps or detergents to the water.
The main job of soaps and cleaners is to reduce the barriers to dissolution in water, so that the solubility increases.
Water alone is a cleansing agent that lacks the effectiveness of the cover, as the fats and proteins that make up organic soils are not easily soluble in water.
However, cleaning with sufficient running water is also helpful.
Solid soap, due to its reusability, may have a bit of a bit of a backpack from previous uses.
A small number of studies that thought it possible to transfer bacteria from solid soaps have concluded that it is unlikely because the bacteria are washed with soap.
“The CDC continues to state that ‘liquid soap is preferred with the possibility of use without the need for hand contact.’”
Antibacterial soaps have been widely promoted to promote collective health.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can produce antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial substances such as triclosan, which have a wide list of resistant strains of organisms.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not eliminated by antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as previously advertised in the market.
In addition to surfactants and protective cover materials, this advanced formula may include teaspoons (acetic acid, ascorbic acid and lactic acid) as pH regulators, active benzoic acid with antimicrobial properties, and other moisturizers of the cover (alveolar vera, vitamins, menthols, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis of the public health field of the University of Oregon showed that soaps are as simple.
Hot water that is comfortable to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 <0xC2><0xB0>C).
However, hot soap water is more effective than cold soap water to eliminate natural lifeforms that contain dirt and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific research has shown that hot water use has no effect on reducing the number of hand viruses.
Hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer is an agent with a non-blue base for cleaning the hands.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, nonwater-based hand sanitizers (known as alcohol-based hand sanitizers, hand sanitizers, or hand sanitizers) became less and less well known.
Mostly based on alcohol-based isopropyl or ethanol acetate with a condenser such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) that is converted into a jade, or a moisturizer such as glycerin in a liquid, or foam for easy use of alcohol and reducing the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of dilute hydrogen peroxide increases its antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers, including at least 60 to 95 percent alcohol, have a long function to kill germs.
It kills alcohol sterilizers, bacteria, multi-spicy-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccines, influenza, and hepatitis) and fenugreek.
70% alcohol disinfectants can kill up to 99.97% (logarithmic reduction of 3.5%, similar to 35 decibels) of bacteria on the hand after 30 seconds of use, and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 logarithmic reduction) of bacteria on the hand in 1 minute. More hand disinfectants are effective against some viruses and are less effective.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost ineffective against noroviruses (or Norwalk), the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. A sufficient hand sanitizer or alcohol-based disinfectant should be applied on the cover by fully moisturizing it and covering both hands.
The front and back of both hands and the middle and end of all fingers are rubbed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, floor, or jaw is dry.
Fingertips should also be well washed by rubbing the palms of the hands. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers hand washing more important than hand sanitizers, especially when the hands are clearly dirty.
The increased use of these detergents is based on ease of use and rapid activity in eliminating microorganisms; however, they should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing unless soap and water are available.
Repeated use of alcoholic disinfectants causes dry hands unless moisturizers and/or softeners are added to their formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced by adding glycerin and/or other moisturizers to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers that contain moisturizers produced less irritation and dryness than antibacterial soaps.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact itching syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives found in hand-held alcoholic gels rarely occurs.
Because it causes less itchy contact dermatitis than hand washing with soap and water, it is popular.
Despite its long functioning, non-blue base agents don't clean hands from organic matter, they just disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the release of peptide agents, as the peptide agents are still on hand.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand sanitizers is heavily dependent on its ingredients and formulations, and historically, it has been much less effective than alcohol and alcoholic clothing.
Recently, formulations using benzalconium chloride have shown continuous and increasing antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, which reduces efficacy after repeated use, possibly due to progressive inversion reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford to buy soap and use dirt and ashes.
Ash or soil may be more effective than water, but it is less likely to be effective than soap.
Another concern is soil or ash infection with microorganisms, which may be more likely to help spread the disease rather than to reduce it.
Like soap, ash is a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution in contact with water.
In the absence of soap, the World Health Organization recommends ashes or sand as an alternative to soap.
The correct hand-washing technique recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent transmission of the disease includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with hot or cold running water.
Current water is recommended because it may be stagnant ponds, although the water temperature may not seem to be different.
Apply your hands, including from the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails, with plenty of soap.
Soap removes germs from the cover, and studies show that people wash their hands more thoroughly when they use soap than when they use only empty water.
Rub your hands together for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing hands together creates friction that helps kill germs, rubbing more microbes for longer periods of time.
Wash well under the water.
Washing in a single sink can re-purpose the hand.
Dry with clean water or let it dry with air.
Wet and wet hands are easier to re-purpose. The areas that are not most washed include thumbs, wrists, between fingers and under nails.
Artificial nails and discarded nail polish may be traced to microorganisms.
Moisturizing cream is often recommended to keep your hands dry; dry cover can lead to cover damage, which can increase the risk of infection transmission.
"Different cheap options can be used in developing countries if needed to facilitate hand washing where tap water and/or soap are not available. For example, pouring water and/or soap from a suspended gallon or dry pumpkin cover with suitable holes and/or ashes. In limited water supply conditions (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are "low-cost" water-saving solutions.
Tap without handle is a simple technology that is used by using a suspended pitcher with a rope and a leg lever to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a soap mold.
Proper drying of hands is an important part of hygiene, but there is some debate about the most effective way to dry hands in public toilets.
The increasing volume of research shows that paper cleaners are much healthier than electric dryers used in most bathrooms.
In 2008, a study by the University of Westminster in London, funded by the paper-cleaning industry of the European Texture Symposium, was conducted to compare the health levels offered by paper hand cleaners, hot air hand dryers and Airjet hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a hot air dryer, it was found that the average total amount of bacteria on the palm of the finger increased by 194% and on the palm of the hand increased by 254%.
Drying the hand with an air blower increased the number of bacteria on the palm of the finger by 42% and on the palm of the hand by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a clean paper hand, the total amount of bacteria on the palms of the fingers decreased by 76% and on the palms of the hands by 77%. The scientists also carried out experiments to determine whether there is a possibility of interaction between other toilet users and the bathroom environment due to the use of any drying method.
Airjet air dryer, which blows air out of the car at 180 meters per second (650 km per hour), is capable of blowing microorganisms from the hands and devices, and can expose the potential use of toilets and toilet environments up to 2 meters away.
The use of a hot hand dryer spreads the microorganisms over the 0.25 meter dryer.
The paper-cleaning hand did not reveal the spread of microorganisms. In 2005, a study conducted by T<0xC3><0x9C>V Product und Umwelt examined various hand drying methods.
The following conversions were seen in the number of bacteria after drying hands:
There are different types of hand dryers and hand dryers are compared to paper cleaners.
Washing your hands with hand sanitizer while traveling can replace soap and water.
Alcoholic beverages must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing became compulsory long after Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis (in 1846) discovered its effectiveness in treating disease in a hospital setting.
There are a number of electronic devices that use feedback to remind the treatment team not to forget to wash their hands.
One study showed a decrease in infection rates by using them.
Medical hand washing, using sufficient amounts of soap and water or foaming and rubbing each part of the hands for at least 15 seconds.
Hands should be rubbed together by locking fingers.
If there are berries and cloth under the nails, it is best to use a hair brush to clean it.
Since germs remain in the water and on the hands, it is important to rinse properly and then dry with a clean face.
After drying, a clean paper hand should be used to close the tap of water (and open each exit door if needed).
This prevents the re-emergence of the hands through such surfaces.
"The purpose of hand-washing in health care centers is to eliminate microorganisms ("microbials") and stop the spread of the virus."
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand-washing in the majority of healthcare settings is at an unacceptable level, in addition to a large number of doctors and nurses who constantly forget to wash their hands before they come into contact with the patient, causing the transfer of microorganisms.
One study found that proper hand washing and other simple tasks can reduce the rate of blood infections through catheters by 66%. The World Health Organization has published an article to show how to wash hands properly in health care sectors.
Find the hygiene guideline drafted by the Healthcare Organization on the organization's website, which is available to the public.
A related review study was conducted by Whitby and colleagues.
If required to prove compliance with regulations, commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has introduced five “positions” for hand washing:
After contact with blood/body fluids
before decommissioning, and
"After patient care. Adding chemical disinfectants to soap ("natural" or "anti-degradable" soaps) contributes to the microbial properties of hand-washing detergents."
"Such lethal actions are likely to be desirable before surgery or in situations where antibiotic-resistant organisms are very prevalent. To "clean" a person's hands for surgery, it is necessary to "clean" a person's hands without having to touch them open and close, chlorhexidine or aidine detergent, sterile hand cleaners to dry their hands after washing, and a sterile bristile to clean up under the nails."
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure involves washing hands and forearms up to the elbow for two to six minutes.
It is not necessary to rub very long (10 minutes).
When washing hands, the water poured on the forearm should not reach the hands again.
After washing the hands, the hands are dried with a clean sterile hand and the gynecomastia is covered.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands before and after handling a sick person or use a disinfectant.
In conjunction with the control of staphylococcal infection in hospitals, it has been shown that the main benefit of hand washing is achieved only in the initial 20% of the time of washing, and continuing to wash the hands provides a small added benefit of up to 35%.
Washing with plain soap tripled the transmission of bacterial infectious diseases to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. Comparing hand-washing alcohol-based solution with hand-washing antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds showed that hand-washing with alcohol reduced antibacterial soap by 26% more than antibacterial soap.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand sanitizers in reducing H1N1 influenza type A virus and Clostridium difficile spores. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in medical care centers can include training staff on hand sanitizers, increasing access to alcohol-based hand sanitizers, and oral and written reminders for employees.
More research is needed to determine which of these interventions is most effective at different health care facilities.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered a cost-effective and essential tool for achieving optimal health and even proper nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water, soap, or hand washing supplies in people’s homes, in schools, and at work makes achieving universal hand washing behavior a challenge.
For example, in rural areas of Africa, the taps of handwashing near private or public toilets are scarce, although there are cheap options for building places to wash hands.
However, the low rate of hand washing can be partly a result of established habits rather than the absence of soap or water.
Encouraging and supporting hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness about the benefits of hand washing, and lead to the transformation of long-term behavior in the population.
For effective functioning, monitoring and evaluation are essential.
"The systematic review of 70 studies showed that community-based approaches are effective in increasing hand washing in LMICs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example to promote hand washing in schools is the "Three Star Approach" by UNICEF, which encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive steps, such as ensuring that students wash their hands with soap, in addition to observing health imperatives."
After winning at least one set of stops, schools can be promoted from one star to three.
The construction of hand washing stations can be part of the advertising activities of the hand washing campaign aimed at reducing diseases and deaths of children.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that strives to transform behavior. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the use of handwashing emoji.
Few studies have considered the overall effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in relation to DALYs.
However, one study found that promoting hand washing with soap is much more cost-effective than other hygiene interventions.
"The importance of washing hands for human health, especially those with vulnerable conditions such as recently born mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first introduced in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Dr. Inessa Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, who was the founder of Modern Nursing in England."
At the time, the majority of the population believed that infections were the result of bad odors they were called myasmas.
In the 1980s, the prevalence of food-borne infections and health-related infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to actively promote hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the onset of infection.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the global COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 raised awareness among many countries about the importance of hand washing to prevent such infectious diseases.
For example, posters containing "correct hand washing techniques" were installed next to toilet sinks in public toilets and in the toilets of German office buildings and airfields.
The phrase “washing one’s hands of” something means a declaration of a person’s unwillingness to take responsibility or share it.”
It comes from a passage in the Gospel of Matthew in which Pontius Pilate gives up the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become more widely used in some English conversations.
In Shakespeare's "Macbeth," Lady Macbeth frequently washes her hands unconsciously to remove the stain that reflects her conscience of the crimes she committed and forcing her husband to commit.
It has also been shown that people wash their hands more often after remembering or thinking of immoral things and are more concerned with hand washing.
“In addition, people who are allowed to wash their hands after such care are less likely to participate in other ‘cleaning’ compensation measures, such as volunteering.”
Religions prescribe hand washing for health and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, using soap-free water to wash hands, is part of the ritual that has been exhibited in many religions, including the Baha’i faith, Hinduism, Tuileh, and Netalat Yadhim in Judaism, Laobo in Christianity, and Wazdu in Islam. Religions especially after some practices recommend healthy hand washing.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam dictate washing hands after going to the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam have ordered hand washing before and after each meal.
Controlling the hazards of the working environment for COVID-19
Workplace hazard control for COVID-19 means applying health and safety measures to control the risks and prevent the onset of the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19).
The proper control of hazards in the workplace depends on the workspace and task assigned, and varies according to the risk assessment of sources of contact with disease, the severity of the disease in the community, and risk factors for each worker who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Health and Security Administration (OSHA), low-risk occupations have a minimum level of occupational contact with the general public and other coworkers, and it is recommended that these occupations take minimal precautions to prevent infection, including hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home in case of illness, wearing masks, and regular cleaning and disinfection of the workplace.
Medium-risk occupations include those that do not require high or close contact with suspected COVID-19 patients, but may be at risk due to direct contact with the general public or international travel.
This includes employees who are in contact with the general public in areas such as schools, high-density task areas and some large retail stores.
Controlling the risks for this group, in addition to initial measures to prevent infection, includes air conditioning using high-efficiency air filters, sneezing protection, and access to personal protective equipment for exposure to a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA considers health care workers who are exposed to people suspected of COVID-19 to be employed in high-risk occupations, which can be extended to very high-risk if aerosol-generating procedures are used or if samples are taken from suspected or infected people with COVID-19 are taken.
Working hazard controls that are appropriate for these employees include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for the job.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have multiple effects in the workplace.
Employees may not be present at work because of illness, the need to care for others, or the fear of being exposed to the disease.
Trade patterns can be transformed, both in terms of the goods that are in demand and in terms of the way in which these goods are received (e.g., purchases in the off-peak hours or by on-site delivery services or riding services).
Finally, the shipment of goods from geographic areas severely affected by COVID-19 can be problematic. A plan of preparation and response to antibody can be used to guide protective measures.
In the plans, the risk level associated with various workplace and occupational tasks is taken into account, including sources of contact with disease, risk factors in the social environment and at home, and risk factors for each worker individually, including age or disease of a chronic illness.
Proper control methods are also necessary to avoid these risks and exchange plans for situations that may occur following the outbreak.
Plans for the preparation and response to infectious diseases may be implemented taking into account national or local recommendations.
Objectives to respond to the spread of the disease include reducing transmission among employees, protecting people who pose a higher risk of underlying health conditions, maintaining business activities, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in society, where businesses are located, affects the responses they receive.
A hazard control hierarchy is a framework that is widely used to maintain the integrity and safety of the workplace to group the hazards according to the extent of impact.
Where it is not possible to eliminate the risks of COVID-19, engineering controls and subsequent administrative controls and, ultimately, personal protective equipment are among the most effective methods of control.
Engineered controls consist of segregating employees from work-related risks without relying on employee behavior, which can be the most cost-effective solution.
Administrative controls include changes made to the policies or procedures that employees or employees must follow.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is less effective than administrative and engineering controls, but can avoid some risks.
All types of PPE should be selected on the basis of risk to employees, properly installed (e.g. medical masks), regularly used, inspected, serviced, replaced and, if necessary, opened, cleaned and re-installed, or discarded to prevent infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), there are less-risk occupations that have the lowest level of job contact with the general public or other colleagues.
Precautions for preventing the disease, which are recommended to people in all areas of the job, can be to wash hands regularly, to encourage employees to stay at home in case of illness, to wear a respirator mask and, of course, to cover their mouth when coughing or sneezing, to access paper towels and trash cans, to prepare for long-distance communication or irregular working hours, to encourage employees to use other tools, equipment, and to clean the environment.
Identifying and isolating people who are likely to be infected is one of the critical steps in protecting employees, customers, clients and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with severe respiratory symptoms should stay at home for at least 24 hours after stopping the use of anti-fever medications or any other symptoms, and that the health leave policy be more flexible to allow employees to stay home to take care of sick family members, and all employees should be aware of these new guidelines.
Medium-risk occupations, according to the OSHA, include occupations that require high contact times and with relatively close distances within the six feet (1.8 meters) range from others, and it is not clear whether or not COVID-19 patients are infected, but due to ongoing community arrivals or international travel to a place where COVID-19 is prevalent, it may be SARS-CoV-2.

Employees in this risk group rarely need breathing machines.
If a person gets sick on a plane, appropriate control methods can be used to protect the staff and other passengers, from attacking, separating the sick person from others, to establish a distance of at least 6 feet, to assign a dedicated crew to the sick person, to provide a face mask to the sick person, and to ask him or her to cover the mouth and nose with a handkerchief while sneezing or coughing.
Cabin crews should wear disposable medical gloves when serving a sick passenger or touching body discharges or surfaces that are likely to be contaminated, and if the sick passenger is suffering from fever, frequent coughs or shortness of breath, use other personal protective equipment if possible.
Gloves and other disposable items should be thrown in hospital trash bags, surfaces must be cleaned and disinfected after work. For commercial shipping, including transfers with cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk controls include cancellation of travel in case of illness, self-isolation, and immediate notification to the ship’s medical center if a fever or other signs appear on board.
Ideally, the pursuit of treatment should be done in the cabin of the abducted person. The CDC recommends that schools and childcare centres close for a short period of time for cleaning and disinfection, regardless of the prevalence of the disease at the community level, as a single person may have been present in the school building.
When the rate of social transmission is low or moderate, social distancing strategies such as cancelling camps, gatherings and other gatherings such as in-person training or singing classes or dining in cafeterias, increasing the distance between tables, turning start and end hours, limiting the presence of unnecessary clients, and using a separate hygiene office for children who are experiencing symptoms similar to the flu.
When there is significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, long-term school closures should be considered. The CDC believes there are few direct health risks for law enforcement personnel performing their day-to-day activities.
Law enforcement officers who are in contact with people who are suspected of contracting COVID-19 are advised to follow the same procedures as emergency medical technicians, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
If a close contact occurs during the period of panic, employees should clean and disinfect their work belts and appliances with a spray or household handkerchief before reuse, and work stops associated with the use and discarding of PPE, and follow the maintenance and washing of dirty clothes.
OSHA believes that certain workers in the health care sector and morgue fall into the category of high-risk or very high-risk occupations.
High-risk occupations, such as providing health care, support, laboratory, and medical transport personnel who are exposed to infected or suspected COVID-19 patients.
If employees are using aerosol-generating procedures, or picking up and transporting samples from suspected or infected COVID-19 patients, these cases have a very high risk of spread.
Aerosol-generating procedures can include intubation, measures to reduce cough, bronchoscopy, certain dental examinations and surgeries, or obtaining an invasive sample.
Risky morgue jobs include jobs in which a person has to prepare the bodies of people suspected or suspected of COVID-19 after their death; if they are carried out on the body of an autopsy, these tasks are among the most risky occupations. For these risk groups, additional engineering controls should also be considered, including experimenting rooms for patients who are suspected to have COVID-19.
In some health and cold environments, negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate.
Samples should be carried according to the precautionary measures of biological defense level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that new patients be placed in separate waiting areas depending on whether they are suspected to be infected with COVID-19. The OSHA recommends that those working within 6 feet of patients or those suspected of SARS-CoV-2, and those performing aerosol-generating procedures, in addition to other personal protective equipment, wear medical masks.
In the United States, in the framework of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that includes face testing, practice, and medical examination, N95 respirator masks approved by NIOSH or better samples should be used.
Other types of respiratory devices can provide additional protection and improve employee comfort. The World Health Organization does not recommend supplemental coverage, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is not primarily transmitted by body secretions.
The World Health Organization recommends only surgical masks for starting point screening personnel.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that those who take, hold, or transfer respiratory samples collected from COVID-19 patients without any aerosol-generating procedures wear surgical masks, protective glasses, face shields, gowns and gloves.
If an aerosol generator is used, the surgical mask will be replaced with an N95 or FFP2 mask.
Considering that the global supply of PPE is inadequate, the World Health Organization recommends minimizing the need for personal protective equipment through the following measures: telemedicine (remote telemedicine), placing physical barriers such as transparent windows, allowing people with COVID-19 symptoms to enter the room without direct care, using PPE only for essential work, wearing a medical mask, and providing multiple care when they are sick.

Title Line: [Covid-19] Lightening the load and preparing for the future
Post date/time: 14 March 2020, 00:00:24 World coordinated time
License granted: CC0: Which rights are not reserved
We see ourselves in interesting circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic is what defines the global interconnectedness of humans and our responsibilities to each other.
This is an unprecedented challenge, but we know for sure that our best response relies on the sense of empathy, cooperation, and social duty that lies at the heart of the organization.
The empathy and care we see through email, phone calls, and chat among all our colleagues shows how fortunate we are to work with such wonderful people.
I am so grateful and proud to have colleagues like you.
Last week, someone shared their gratitude for our work with me.
They reminded me how important it is for the world to go to Wikipedia now, and what a powerful symbol it is to stay online and be available to everyone for these critical resources.
Your efforts will make this possible, whether you help sites continue to work, whether your colleagues get paid, or whether our community stays safe.
Now more than ever, the world needs the information that Wikipedia provides.
This is a moment in which not only what we do, but how we do it, will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, there will be several significant transformations in the way we work together in the coming week.
Our Work Conversions and Schedule
As Robin said earlier, the C team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
In this conversation, we considered the issues that we thought were the right answer to the problem we’re facing and the best way to keep the company effective and sustainable.
We want more than anything to relieve tension and support our mission in the long run.
If you need to call again, that’s okay.
For all employees, contractors and contractors:
By the second announcement, our work forecast will be about 4 hours per day or 20 hours per week.
We do not declare a state of shutdown – if you are able to work more hours as usual, the mission can benefit from your help.
However, the world is unpredictable right now, and whether you have to take care of your loved ones or go to the doctor, your well-being is our top priority.
We do not record your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
No need to mention it, but we’ll mention it again.
Which sick leave or PTO isn't necessary - just tell your manager and help your team review calendars and time-sharing to ensure that important areas of work are covered.
(If your COVID-19 test result has been declared positive, please inform Brian at T&amp;C Ops so that T&amp;C can provide you with support and make sure the management is adequately aware of your situation.)
The salary of those who work on an hourly basis will be paid in full.
We’ve already made the headlines, and we’re once again committed to respecting the commitments we have to our hourly contractors and partners.
Everyone should be paid according to their normal working hours under normal conditions.
If you are sick and unable to do the work, this includes you.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to challenge their stress with the world around them.
What we do can be incredibly valuable, especially at times like this.
Again, it’s about taking care of yourself.
We ask that you stay in touch with your manager, so we know what to expect and we can adjust accordingly.
Some things are considered essential.
There are things that still need to be done.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and fundraising teams (among others) are doing vital work that may require additional support.
We will begin a process in all units to assess our current goals and focus on supporting whatever is necessary to accomplish this mission.
There is a lot of work to be done, we will focus only on the most important projects.
Reducing the current working rhythm will not cause future losses.
“We are not going to double the time when this pandemic ends to compensate for the backwardness.”
You won’t be expected to do more to meet deadlines, which are now unreasonable.
We accept that the circumstances have changed and will take action if necessary to set new goals and timelines.
What happens to the APP?
To meet the reality and expectations of the new working day, we plan to change the timeframe for the delivery of our 2020-2021 calendar.
We plan to expand our 2019-2020 plan so that we can spend more time budgeting, allowing employees to prioritize basic work, caring for themselves, and caring for their loved ones, while at the same time setting a lighter agenda for those who need or want to work in the next few weeks.
This extension of the timeline reduces the current working pressure for planning and the pressure on the entire organization.
We will submit our proposal to the Board next week, and as soon as we receive approval, we will inform the delegates and teams of the next steps.
We thank the APP team for the leadership they had.
Condition, Hazard Level and Cleaning of the Workplace
Last week, we learned that one of the staff at our SF was likely exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, due to precautions, we recruited an anti-virus cleaning crew to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used a hospital antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the lobby and left chambers leading to the ground floor.
The building implements its own surveillance protocol by using products that protect the immunity of its residents.
We feel comfortable that the office will be fully prepared for our return time.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all DC staff.
Last week, our DC office became a completely remote way of working in accordance with the guidance shared with San Francisco.
As some New York City resident colleagues know, we’re in talks to rent a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are experiencing remote work for the first time.
Our long-term remote colleagues should be aware that there may be some changes and I needed to make some recommendations:
Sessions are limited to a maximum of one or two hours.
If you need longer sessions, think about splitting the session and holding it in a few days.
Define the meeting in a clear way, schedule the meeting, and send out the materials that need to be read in advance.
With tools like Google Docs and Zoom, make video calls a default to facilitate live collaboration and communication.
In all the meetings of a leader, the person who oversees the conversation will follow the list of people who are speaking and have someone to take notes (or work together to make notes).
If you need a mobile phone, send an e-mail to the technical support department.
Use your welfare refund to buy snacks.
Join the <0x23>remoties channel on Slack and talk to your colleagues in connection with the distribution of work
Human Resource Operations team to support the increase in the distribution of work across the entire foundation, examines the ergonomics and webinar-based guidance.
Last week, we asked all social aid recipients to cancel public events sponsored by Wikimedia, such as Edith Ethan, until the WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We inform them that we understand that your request for cancellation and other restrictions may make it impossible to complete the agreed-upon grant activities and that no one will be fined for delaying or converting those purposes.
In the coming week, we will provide more guidance on Wikimania and other local and thematic social conferences.
It turns out that the world’s public is saddened by the interruption, but they feel relieved to be able to focus on their social activities, Wikimedia, and other ways.
By taking a step forward, CRT is working to create a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our relationship with them.
Be aware of COVID-19 issues.
We will send an invitation to a global coordinated time of 07:00 PT for a special staff meeting next Thursday at 14:00.
We will use this opportunity to share complementary timelines, answer your questions, and contact each other.
We are in this together and ready to help as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can also find information via this email and visit Office Wiki for all the other essential information related to COVID-19.
CRT helps these pages to be updated and all the information is kept in one place.
We do our best to stay in regular contact with the staff of the most affected countries.
If you have any questions related to travel, events, a major workflow, or a cover-up challenge, or any other topic you need help with, please inform the CRT immediately and cooperate with it.
We are ready to help provide support and communication, as necessary.
If you are aware of a confidential or sensitive subject, please email Bryan Judean, Director of Global HR International Operations.
Which of these transformations should not be considered as abandoning work and commitments.
On the contrary, they now show that our work and commitments must be adapted in a new way that has never been experienced before.
These are the steps that we believe are necessary to support each other in order to continue to work, to inject the self-supporting movement that it needs, and to support the world it depends on.
Our planned work will wait for us for the right time.
Now is the time to support each other and create a space for the important work that we will have to do in the weeks and possibly months ahead.
We need all of you to do this, and so we ask all of you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can be at your best when you need it.
Now, please -- wash your hands and don't touch your face!

Angiotensin-2B (ACE2) transducer enzyme is an enzyme that binds to the outer surface of the lung cells, blood vessels, heart, pollen, and amputation.
ACE2 counteracts the activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme by reducing the amount of angiotensin 2 and increasing the angiotensin (1-7), making it an effective target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 continues to act as an entry point for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often called hACE2.
The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 consists of a zinc-containing metallurgy that is placed on the surface of the intravenous and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal M2 peptidase range and the amino acid transporting C-terminal pollen.
ACE2 is a type of single-pass membrane protein that has an active enzymatic amplitude that lies on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular amplitude of ACE2 is split by another enzyme called the transmembrane amplitude, and the soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the form of urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 binds to the cell membranes of mostly cavity-shaped cells of type 6, small ocular enterocytes, intravascular cells, and smooth artery muscle cells in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA is still found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as an anti-equilibrium of ACE.
ACE divides angiotensin one hormone into angiotensin two, which is a vasoconstrictor.
ACE2 instead isolates phenylalanine amino acid carboxyl-terminal from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into angiotensin-dilatator (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-O).
ACE2 can cause the fission of a number of other peptides including /(dos-arg9)-bedakinin, nerotensin, dynorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the passage of neutral amino acid carriers SLC6A19 through the membrane and plays a role in Hartnap disease.
ACE2 serves as the main entry point to the cell for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63 (the virus that causes SARS) and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Specifically, the link between S1 spike proteins in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the enzymatic domain ACE2 on the surface of cells leads to endocytosis and the transmission of both viruses and enzymes to endosomes located in cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of S protein via the host serine protease TMPRSS2, which inhibits it as a possible treatment under investigation. This led to the hypothesis that lowering ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, several professional associations and surveillance institutions have recommended the continuation of the ACE inhibitor standard and ARB treatment.
A principled review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls."
"In addition, it has also reduced the risk of pneumonia in patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, patients who are at higher risk for pneumonia, especially patients with stroke and heart failure."
“The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-induced death, although the results were less potent than the overall risk of pneumonia.”
It turns out that recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is a new treatment for acute pulmonary injury and has improved pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs suffering from acute respiratory dystrophy caused by lipopolysaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, and the onset of action is 30 minutes plus a 24-hour cycle of impact.
Various findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising follow-up for those who are resistant to classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in long-term angiotensin II diseases. rhACE2 injections have been studied in clinical studies for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
"Covid-19 B programs are mobile phone software programs designed to help trace contact in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, the process of identifying persons ("calls") who may have been in contact with an individual."
Many applications were developed with official government support in some regions and territories.
Several frameworks have been created to create communication tracking applications.
Concerns have been raised about privacy, especially about systems that operate based on tracking the geographic location of users of mobile apps.
Less intrusive options include using Bluetooth signals to record the user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would be deploying a feature to support these Bluetooth-based apps directly on Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay, has launched a program that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with people infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, a softway called Tris Togader is used.
“The app was developed by the local Information Technology Association, released as open-source and delivered to the government. North Macedonia launched a mobile app called ‘StopKorona!’, a Bluetooth-based app to track contacts with potentially high-stakes people, allowing for quick response for health officials.”
It was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app has been awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
"On April 12, the government stated that the contact tracking app was at an advanced stage of development and would be available for deployment within weeks. A similar program is also planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid")."
Australia and New Zealand are planning to develop a soft veer based on Singapore's Softwire Trace Tweeder and the Bluetris Stand Protocol. Russia plans to design its softweather geographic fence for patients who have been declared positive for COVID-19 and are living in Moscow to ensure that they do not leave the house.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, has listed a number of potential practical problems in program-based systems, including false positives and inefficiency if the program is used only for a small portion of the population.
Addressing concerns related to the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple has imposed restrictions on organizations that can add coronavirus-related apps to the App Store's App Store, limiting it only to "official" or reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy activists expressed concern about the use of mass surveillance using coronavirus programs, especially in connection with the dismantling of the surveillance infrastructure created to combat the coronavirus pandemic after the viral threat was eliminated.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the restriction of this type of surveillance.
The organization announced eight conditions for government projects:
“Surveillance must be ‘legal, necessary and proportionate’”
The expansion of surveillance and surveillance must have terminated the date clauses;
The use of data should be limited to the objectives of COVID-19;
Data security and anonymity must be maintained and this protection must be based on evidence.
Digital surveillance should not exacerbate discrimination and marginalization;
Any data sharing with third parties must be defined by law;
There must be safeguards against mistreatment and civil rights to respond to mistreatment;
“Significant subscriptions will be required by all “relevant stakeholders,” including public health experts and marginalized groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also released a checklist.”
Google/Apple’s proposed plan aims to address the ongoing surveillance problem by removing the tracking mechanism from their device’s operating system when it is no longer needed.
Some countries use network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating the need to download an app and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that access raw location data pose potential privacy problems.
However, not all systems with central servers require access to personal location data. A number of privacy systems have been created that use central servers only for two-way communication (see section below).
In South Korea, a program-based system was used to conduct contact tracing.
Instead of using an allocation program, the system collects tracking information from various sources, including mobile tracking data and card transaction data, and combines it to generate notifications via text messages to people suspected of the infection.
In addition to using this information to alert potential audiences, the government has made location information available to the public, which was authorized due to widespread changes in privacy laws following the outbreak of MERS in that country.
This information is made available to the public through a number of apps and websites. Countries such as Germany consider the use of centralized systems and privacy protection.
As of April 6, 2020, the details had not yet been released.
Privacy-related contact tracing is a credible idea that has allocated countless research since at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have been working on top-of-the-line privacy solutions, such as low-energy Bluetooth usage (BLE) to record a user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that involves both a centralized and decentralized approach and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include privacy-adjacent tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary call counting (TCN), fka, CEN call-to-contact events, privacy-sensitive protocols, and mechanisms for phone-to-call tracking (CTPA), and others.
In these protocols, personally identifiable data never leaves the car and all traces occur in the car.
The privacy group at the MIT Media Lab has been developing SafePaths, a platform that uses privacy techniques when collecting and using location data or route intersections to track the spread of COVID-19.
“This is based on research from the White Paper ‘Apps Gone Rogue: Privacy at the Time of the Epidemic’ released in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company that is developing privacy technologies that were originally created at MIT Media Lab.”
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive data about their location and accuracy with other users and authorities without compromising the privacy of this data.
On April 5, 2020, the TCN Global Coalition was formed by groups that focused on what was essentially the same approach and broad overlapping protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and creating global interoperability in tracking and alert applications - a key aspect to achieving widespread adoption.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that the BlueTrace protocol used in the government’s official software was open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control Android and iOS devices, announced an innovation for audience tracking based on a combination of low-energy Bluetooth technology and privacy encryption, which they claim protects privacy.
They have also published specifications for the central technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is planned to be expanded in three steps:
Unveiling new gadgets to empower governments to create official coronavirus tracking apps with privacy.
Direct integration of this functionality into iOS and Android; Google and Apple are planning to distribute the system through operating system updates first and then remove it in the same way after the risk transition.
Re-application of the drug b (also known as the drug of conversion, re-profiling, re-applying, or therapeutic conversion) is the re-use of a post-approved drug to treat a different disease or medical condition than the drug was originally made for.
This is a front of scientific research that is currently being pursued to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research directions include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and plasma injections of recovered people.SARS-CoV-2 contains 66 proteins that can be developed against them, each with several ligand binding sites.
The analysis of these binding sites provides a reasonable project of effective postviral production against COVID-19 proteins.
One of the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 is papain-like protease, RNA-dependent polymerase, helixase, protein S, and ribophosphatase ADP.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
This treatment is not approved by the FDA's clinical trials process and is only authorized as an experimental treatment for the treatment of infertility in patients who are hospitalized and unable to receive treatment in a clinical study.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that "the use, dose, or cycle of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not yet been established.
"Doctors have said that when there is "no other option" they will use this drug."
The Turkish research team in Vladivostok is conducting a study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Extensive studies are underway at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting an experiment on the safety and effectiveness of preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.

With an average of 4 days, 35 patients in Shenzhen tested negative, compared to 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study of more than 240 patients with pneumonia in Wuhan, half of the participants received favipiravir and half omifenovir.
The Italian Spiceworks Office reminded people that the evidence in support of the drug is scarce and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced it would buy the drug from Japan for reserves and use the military to transport the drug to university hospitals where it will be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
“According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has offered the Trump administration to buy drugs. The drug may be less effective in severe cases of the disease that the virus has already replicated.”
It may not be safe for pregnant women or people trying to have children.
"A study on Lupinavir/Ritanavir (Caltra), a combination of Lupinavir and Ritonavir antivirals, concluded that "what benefit was not found in it."
These spices are designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is working to modify the spice and find a compound that binds to SARS-CoV-2 protease. In the scientific community, there are criticisms of resource guidance towards transforming the use of the spice, especially the spice produced for AIDS.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has included Lupinavir/Ritanavir in a joint international experiment.
Remdesivir was developed and developed as a treatment for Ebola virus and Marburg virus infection by Gilead Sciences. Later, Gilead Sciences discovered that Remdesivir has antiviral activity in in vitro conditions against numerous phylococcal, pneumo, paramics and coronaviruses.
One issue associated with antiviral therapy is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some early pre-test studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical studies are underway, including two conducted by hospitals at the University of Cleveland; one for people with mild disease levels and one for people with severe disease levels.
Three clinical studies are underway for injecting vitamin C into hospitalized and severely ill people due to COVID-19: two controlled placebo trials (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled trial (Italy).
The state of New York began antibiotic testing of azithromycin on March 24, 2020.

Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung problems in patients suffering from mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called Colcorona, found that 6,000 adults aged 40 and older who were diagnosed with COVID-19 had mild symptoms of the disease that do not require bed rest.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or do not use an effective method of pregnancy are not eligible.
Several anticonvulsants have been tested in Italy.
Because of its low molecular weight, heparin is widely used for the treatment of patients and has led the Italian Medical and Post-Agency Agency to issue recommendations regarding its use.
A multicenter study of more than 300 patients investigating the use of enoxaparin sodium in therapeutic doses was published in Italy on April 14.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, considerable scientific attention has shifted to the conversion of approved antiviral spices that have been approved for previous outbreaks of viruses such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Rabavirin is recommended according to the seventh edition of the Chinese directive for the treatment of COVID-19

Some antibiotics that are known as potential treatments for COVID-19 include:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): Approved by China.
Tests have also been conducted in Italy and China, and you can see the <0x23>COVID-19 tocilizumab.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a vaccine based on the hypothesis against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although the vaccine has not completed clinical studies, several efforts are underway to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that it did not expect a vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus to be available in less than 18 months.
The five proposed vaccines were included in Phase I safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was diagnosed in December 2019.
A major worldwide outbreak in 2020, which led to significant investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations are using published genomes to develop possible vaccines to fight SARS-CoV-2.
As stated in April, the guidelines of the CEPI initiative for the development of vaccines include: speed, production capacity, scale expansion and global availability.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under investigation and production in early 2020 to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main objectives of the platform, which has progressed during the first phase of the exemption studies, include:
Nucleic Acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase One Developer and Vaccine Candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (phase of a developer and vaccine proposed: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenovirus vector)
According to scientists from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) in April, a total of 115 vaccine samples were in the early stages of development, of which 78 have been approved as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute) and 37 other vaccines have been announced, but little is known (assumed to be in the planning or design phase).
Phase I-II testing tests the initial immunity and prophylaxis, and is generally randomized, placebo-controlled, and performed in multiple locations, while determining a more effective and accurate dose.
Phase 3 trials typically involve more participants, including a control group and vaccine testing effectiveness to curb the disease, as well as monitoring side effects at optimal doses.
Of the 79 vaccines proposed to be in active development (approved in early April 2020), 74 have not yet reached the human evaluation stage (they are still in "preclinical" research).
On January 24, 2020, in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was considering a possible molecular clam vaccine that converts genetically modified viral proteins to stimulate the immune system's response.

"At the same time, the Canadian government announced an allocation of US$192 million in a special way to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, along with plans to create a 'National Vaccine Bank' with several new vaccines that can be used in the event of an outbreak of other coronaviruses."
"On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School reported the test of PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine in mice, stating that "the MNA received from the SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines caused strong antigen-specific antibody responses [in mice] that were evident 2 weeks after immunization."
On April 16, 2020, Waterloo University of Spice Science Design announced a DNA-based sample vaccine as a possible nasal spray.
By using bacteriophages, DNA is designed to replicate inside human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which may stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three U.S. universities shared resources to access IBM’s cloud computing, along with cloud computing resources from Holt Packard, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have unbiased effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can have more benefits than cures.
Another randomized trial in Australia seeks to register 4,170 health and treatment forces.
It is possible that developing vaccines are not safe or effective.
Early research to assess the efficacy of the vaccine using specific animal models of COVID-19, including transgenic-ACE2 mice, other laboratory animals and non-human mammals, demonstrates the need for Level-3 biological protection measures to control living viruses, as well as international coordination to ensure Standard's safety procedures.
The SARS and MERS vaccines have been tested on animal samples.
By 2020, there will be no protective treatment or vaccine for SARS that has proven to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to articles published in 2005 or 2006, the introduction and development of new vaccines and vaccines to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no approved vaccine against MERS.
When MERS became widespread, it was believed that existing research on SARS might provide a useful model for the development of a vaccine and the treatment of MERS-CoV.
As of March 2020, there was a MERS vaccine (DNA-based) that completed Phase I clinical studies and three more are underway, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two adenoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector case (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have promoted a conspiracy theory that claims the virus has been known to cause COVID-19 and that its vaccine is currently available.
The patent referred to by various social media posts refers to the existing patent for gene sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus variants, such as SARS.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell, and abdominal pain.
From exposure to the virus to the onset of symptoms, it usually takes about 5 days, but it may vary from two to 14 days.
Although the majority of cases have mild symptoms, some develop viral breast and pneumonia and several organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
In addition, 568,000 tons were cured. The virus was initially spread through direct contact, usually with the following droplets from coughing, sneezing or chatting.
When these droplets are produced during ziffer, they usually stick on the ground or on surfaces in exchange for being moved over long distances.
People may become infected by touching a surface and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can live on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
The disease is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although it may be present before the onset of symptoms and in later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is the inverse transcranial polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from the sponge of swallowing.
Wearing masks is recommended for people suspected of contracting the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations about the general use of masks vary, with some authorities opposing the use of masks, some recommending them, and others making them mandatory.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission has been recorded in most countries in all six WHO regions.
People who have been infected with the virus may have no symptoms or symptoms similar to flu, such as fever, cough, fatigue, or shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include respiratory irritation, pain or constant pressure on the breast, dizziness, difficulty waking up and bluening of the face or lips; if these symptoms are present, immediate medical attention is recommended.
Sometimes, symptoms of aloe respiratory system such as sneezing, nasal sneezing or sore throat may be seen.
Symptoms of indigestion, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, have been observed in different percentages.
Some patients in China had only the stiffness of the top cage.
In some people, the disease may lead to chest and arms, multiple organ failure and death.
This is called the incubation period or incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but the area of transformation may vary between two and 14 days.
97.5% of people show symptoms up to 11.5 days after infection. Reports indicate that not all cases of the disease necessarily have symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully understood, although preliminary evidence suggests they may play a role in the spread of the virus.
The proportion of cases that do not show symptoms is currently unknown and under study, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), with 20 percent of all confirmed cases left asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China started importing asymptomatic cases into its daily cases statistics on April 1. Of the 166 infections on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both mouth glazes and stretches have a large amount of the cause of the disease.
Speaking loudly emits more microbes than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that an unprotected cough can cause respiratory droplets to be thrown up to 4.5 metres (15 feet) away.
While the virus is generally not suspended in the air, the National Academy of Sciences said transmission is possible, and air sampling outside the room had positive samples of viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), may cause respiratory discharge to spread through the air, resulting in airborne release.
While there are concerns that the disease can also be transmitted by gastroenteritis, the likelihood is very low. The most contagious condition is when a person has symptoms, although transmission is possible before symptoms appear.
The European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that while the ease of spreading is not entirely clear, one person infects two to three others overall. The virus remains on surfaces for hours.
Specifically, it has been observed that the virus is detectable for up to a day on cardboard, more than three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and more than four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents are also useful when used properly: soap products remove the protective layer of the virus and deactivate it, while also separating the virus from the cover and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chloroxidine glucant (a surgical operation disinfectant), are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, glazing samples were taken at a median interval of two days after hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new respiratory syndrome coronavirus that was first observed in three people with pneumonia in Wuhan who had been diagnosed with low levels of oxygen in their blood and respiratory problems.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus appear in kinship coronaviruses in nature.
Outside of the human body, the virus is killed with regular soap, such as its preservative bubble is destroyed in the produced floor. COVID-19 is closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
The lungs are the organs that are most effective against COVID-19, because the virus enters the host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor that has the largest number of cells in the alveolar type II lungs.
"To transplant into ACE2 and enter the host cell, the virus uses a special glycoprotein (polymer) called 'spike'."
In 12% of hospitalized cases in Wuhan, China, acute heart damage was found, which is more common in severe disease.
Rates of heart disease are high due to inflammatory response and systemic disorders during the progression of the disease, but heart muscle damage may be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are expressed in large quantities in the heart and are shared for the function of the heart.
The high prevalence of thrombosis (31%) and intravenous thrombo-embolism (25%) has been observed in ICU patients with COVID-19 and may be related to poor prognosis of the disease. Autopsies of people who died of COVID-19 show widespread alveolar destruction (DAD) and inflammatory sites involving lymphocytes in the lungs.
While SARS-CoV-2 tends to mucous cells that express ACE2, patients with severe COVID-19 show signs of general inflammation.
Specifically, GM-CM-secreting pathogen T cells were shown to be associated with the use of inflammatory IL-6 secreting monocytes and severe lung pathology among COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic intruders have also been reported in autopsy.
The World Health Organization has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard method of testing is the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Testing is usually done on respiratory samples obtained from a swallowing swab; however, a nasal swab or a sampling of the swab may also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but two blood samples are required, taken two weeks apart, and the results have a low momentum value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and disseminate genetic sequences, so laboratories around the world could develop an independent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect infection based on the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody testing (which can detect active infections and whether a person has been infected in the past) is in development, but has not yet been widely used.
Chinese experiments have shown that accuracy is only 60-70%.
The U.S. Food and Post-Government Organization approved the first point-of-care test on March 21, 2020 for use at the end of that month. Diagnostic procedures published by the Zhongnan Hospital of the University of Wuhan suggested methods for diagnosing infection based on clinical features and contagious diseases.
Bidirectional multipolar matte glass opacities with environmental, asymmetric and posterior distribution are common in early infection.
Pulmonary fillings, strange structures (lobules bladder deterioration and variable fillings of airbags) and pulmonary density are signs of disease progression.
Little information is available on microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings of atopsia include:
Macroscopic: Ploreth, butterfly heart, lung stabilization and pulmonary edema
There are four types of viral pneumonia and chest severity:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary swelling, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte armor and the formation of polycystic giant cells
Severe pneumonia: Extensive alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and reduced blood oxygen levels.
Treatment of Pneumonia: Systematic discharge in the cavities of the air sac and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: Extensive intravenous clotting (DIC); Leucoretroplastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, regularly washing your hands with soap and water, and for at least 20 seconds, maintaining good respiratory health, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with your hands.
The CDC (Center for Disease Control) recommends covering your mouth and nose with a napkin when coughing or sneezing, and coughing or sneezing on your elbow if any napkins are not available.
Hand hygiene is recommended after sneezing or coughing.
To limit the transmission of the disease by people without symptoms, the CDC recommends wearing a face covering in public gatherings. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact with the population by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and cancelling large public gatherings.
Distance procedures also include people staying at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) apart.
"There is no known effective cure for COVID-19. Since the shortest possible time to get a vaccine is no earlier than 2021, there is a key issue in COVID-19 control, and that is an attempt to reduce the peak of the disease, or so-called 'curve straightening'."
The CDC also advises people to wash their hands for 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when the hands are clearly dirty, before eating or after cleaning the nose, after sneezing and coughing.
In addition, it is recommended that consumers consume alcohol with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available. For areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, the WHO offers two formulations for local production.
In this formula, the antimicrobial activity is caused by ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol. "This is not a hand disinfectant active ingredient."
Glycerol was added as a moisture absorber.
Individuals are monitored with supportive care, which may include liquid, oxygen-assisted treatment and support for other vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people suspected to be carriers wear a simple face mask.
Exogenous membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of respiratory irritation, but its benefits are still being explored.
Maintaining personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve the MDFA system.
Healing treatments may be effective for people with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection.The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Chinese National Health Commission have issued recommendations to care for people who have been hospitalized for COVID-19.
Intensive care specialists and six specialists in the United States have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies in a free source, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
Some medical professionals prefer to prescribe paracetamol to relieve symptoms than ibuprofen for an initial treatment.
Caution should be exercised to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in a therapeutic environment where suspended particles may be produced while processes are underway, such as intubation and the use of a manual respiratory system.
For health care professionals who take care of people infected with COVID-19, in addition to taking precautions, the CDC recommends caution in contact and control of airborne infection, placing the person in the airborne infection decomposition room (AIIR). The CDC outlines procedures for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Recommended appliances include: PPE gun, respiratory system or face mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, breathing machines (rather than face masks) are preferred.
N95 respirator filters have been approved for industrial locations, but the FDA has authorised the use of these masks only for an approved emergency use location (EUA).
They are designed to protect airborne particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for applications not listed on the label.
The CDC recommends wearing face shields, or as a last resort, household masks when masks are not available.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not serious enough to require mechanical breathing or something like that, but a percentage of people with these conditions need it.
The type of respiratory assistance that patients with COVID-19-induced respiratory failure are currently being studied in hospitals, and evidence has shown that an intubation or intubation in the respiratory system can be prevented by applying a high-pressure or semi-positive air pressure tube.
Which of the two leads to the same benefit for people who are seriously ill is unknown.
Some doctors prefer to continue with an invasive mechanical ventilator at the time of access, because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to long-flowing nasal oxygen therapy. Acute cases are the most prevalent in Kahlan (people over 60 and especially people over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds, which limits the capacity of a health system to handle the sudden rise in the number of COVID-19 patients in need of hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care imports, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation assistance, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people who went to the hospital for COVID-19 were transferred to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated when acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and oxygen delivery becomes increasingly difficult.
Ventilators, including high-pressure control modes and PEEP, are used to maximize oxygen transfer while reducing the risk of lung damage associated with respiratory and pneumothorax.
Higher pores (PEEP) may not be present in older ventilators.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral treatments have been seen in clinical studies.
Ramdesivir has been the most effective so far.
Although it may take until 2021 to build a new spice, many of the spices being tested have already been proven for other uses or have already been approved in advanced trials.
Antiviral drugs may be tested on people with severe disease.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that volunteers participate in tests to determine the effectiveness and exemption of potential spices. The Food and Post-American Organization (FDA) has issued a temporary authorization for experimental treatment in cases where one’s life is seriously or directly threatened.
It has not undergone clinical studies needed to demonstrate its immunity and efficacy for the disease.
In February 2020, China introduced a mobile software to combat the spread of the disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and identification number.
"This application is able to detect 'close contact' using surveillance data and therefore potential risk of infection."
Each user can check the status of the other three users.
In the event of a potential risk being detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but also alerts local health authorities. Big data analysis of mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track incidents and people who were in contact with South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government activated security agencies to track phone data from people suspected of contracting coronavirus infections.
The measure is designed to quarantine and protect people who may be in contact with their fellow citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared location data with the German Federal Government Agency, Robert Koch Institute, to investigate the spread of the virus.
Russia has implemented facial recognition technology to identify the violators of quarantine.
Julio Galera, a member of the Italian Regional Health Board, said he was informed by mobile operators that “40% of the population is going this way anyway.”
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackathon last week with more than 42,000 subscribers.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid also called for creative solutions to the spread of the coronavirus.
People in quarantine may experience anxiety, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection.
The BBC quoted Rory O’Connor as saying, “More social isolation, loneliness, anxiety associated with health, stress, and economic crisis is a hurricane in all senses to harm people’s mental health and well-being.”
The disease may have a period with mild symptoms or even asymptomatic, similar to those with normal aloe respiratory problems, such as a normal fall.
Mild cases typically heal within two weeks, while those with serious illnesses may take three to six weeks to recover.
According to data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may be at greater risk of contracting COVID-19, but COVID-19 data is not yet available. In a number of people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
COVID-19 in severely infected people may progress rapidly to acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS), which leads to respiratory distress, septic shock, or multi-organ failure.
Problems with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal clotting, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Blood clotting disorders, or a specific type of increase in prothrombin time, have been observed in 6 percent of those hospitalized with COVID-19, while abnormal pollen function has been seen in 4 percent of this group.
In about 20-30% of people infected with COVID-19, they have long liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was 10 days, five of which were hospitalized.
However, in patients who were transferred to the ICU, there was a median period between the time of hospitalization and the time of death of seven days.
In a high-level study of early cases, the average time from showing early symptoms to death was 14 days, with a range of six to 41 days.
In a study conducted by the China National Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8%, compared to 1.7 percent for women.
Histological examinations of post-mortem six samples showed scattered alveolar damage with cellular oxide fibromyal exudates in both of the six.
Viral cytopathic transformations were observed in pneumocytes.
The lung image was similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, the rate of heart damage was due to high rates of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to March statistics in the United States, 89% of hospitalized people had underlying health conditions. The availability of medical resources and the region's economy were not ineffective at the death rate.
Estimates of the death rate due to these conditions vary due to regional differences as well as due to methodological problems.
Lower counts of mild cases cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are caused by cases that have been reported in the past could mean that the mortality rate is currently lower than expected.
Those who vomit are 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and almost 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care compared to non-settled people. There are concerns associated with the long-term presence of the disease.
The Hong Kong hospital administrator found a 20 to 30 percent reduction in six people who had recovered from the disease, and pulmonary scans showed organ damage.
This may also lead to post-traumatic syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was not clear whether previous illnesses in people who recovered from the disease caused long-term, effective immunizations.
Immunity to life is likely due to the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases have been reported in which people who have recovered from COVID-19 have been fully vaccinated again.
These are believed to worsen the long-term infection rather than reinfection.
The virus is thought to be natural and has an animal origin through the transmission of infectious diseases.
The true origin is unknown, but the spread of the infection through December 2019 was complementary to human-to-human transmission.
The study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, announced the first date for the onset of symptoms on December 1, 2019.
Official documents from the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that the first signs of the disease were on December 8, 2019.
Several criteria are usually used to quantify the mortality rate.
These figures vary depending on the region and over time and vary according to the frequency of testing, the quality of the healthcare system, treatment options, the time taken since the onset of the outbreak, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender and overall accuracy.
In late 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) allocated emergency fertilizers to ICD-10 U07.1 for dead patients whose SARS-CoV-2 infection was laboratory-approved and U07.2 fertilizers to patients who died without the SARS-CoV-2 infection were clinically or epidemiologically confirmed to COVID-19.
According to Johns Hopkins University, the global mortality rate for cases as of April 17, 2020 is 6.9% (153822/2240491).
The figures vary according to the region. Other criteria include the mortality rate (CFR), which indicates people who were sick and died, and the rate of infection death (IFR), which shows the percentage of cases (diagnosed or undiagnosed) that have died from the disease.
These statistics are not time-limited and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all patients produce antibodies, the presence of these antibodies indicates how many people have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, in a small village called Castiglione d'Adda, out of 4,600 people, 80 (1.7 percent) died.
In Ganglet, the virus spread through carnival festivals and spread among young people, which reduced the mortality rate. However, not all deaths from COVID-19 are of this type.
In addition, the German health system has not been affected by the reception and treatment of patients.
In the Netherlands, from an assessment of blood donors, about 3% of people may have antibodies.
69 people (0.04% of the population) have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its associated mortality rates are different for men and women.
The mortality rate in men is higher in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, and the gap between men and women is only in the 90s.
In China, the death rate among men was 8.2% and among women 7.1%.
The underlying cause of this gender disparity is not known, but behavioral and genetic factors can be a cause.
Immunological differences based on gender, lesser prevalence of smoking in women, and men's exposure to hemodialysis, such as hypertension at a younger age than women, can play a role in men's higher mortality.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men, and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government no longer tracks data related to COVID-19 through sexual intercourse.
Research shows that viral diseases such as Ebola, AIDS, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, who are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name for the disease is COVID-19.
The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, explained that CO is the beginning of the word coronavirus, VI is the beginning of the word virus, and D is the beginning of the word disease in English, and the 19-year-old figure represents the first occurrence of the virus: December 31, 2019.
The name of the virus is based on the global naming conventions for the prevention of infamy, with no reference to a specific geographic region (e.g. China), or a specific species of animal or group of people selected. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the World Health Organization uses the word "COVID-19 virus" or "COVID-19 virus."
Usually, "coronavirus" refers to both the virus and the disease.
"At the time of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were collectively known as 'coronavirus' and 'coronavirus Wuhan'.
In January 2020, according to guidelines published in 2015 to temporarily label illnesses and viruses by location, the World Health Organization named the disease 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease.
The official names for COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard service chains, some digital factories are producing medical products such as nasal soaps or ventilator parts.
For example, when a hospital in Italy quickly needed a ventilator valve and the supplier was unable to deliver it, a reverse-engineered local startup produced 100 valves in one night.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misinformation about the origin, scale, reliability, treatment, and other aspects of the disease appeared and quickly spread on the Internet.
It turns out that humans are able to spread the virus to a number of other animals.
The research failed to find evidence of the virus proliferating in pigs, ducks and puppies.
What type of medication or vaccine is not approved for the treatment of this disease?
International research on vaccines and vaccines for COVID-19 is underway by government agencies, scientific groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the "Solidarity Trial" to assess the therapeutic effects of the four existing antiviral compounds that have the highest impact hopes."
Which vaccine is not available, but various institutions are actively developing vaccine samples.
Because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use ACE2 receptors to enter human cells, previous research on SARS-CoV is useful.
Three vaccination strategies have been studied in this regard.
Initially, the researchers wanted to develop a complementary virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to stimulate a rapid response of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19.
The second strategy, sub-vaccines, aims to develop a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to specific subunits of the virus.
In connection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, research has focused so much on the S-spike protein that it helps the virus bind itself to the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is to vaccinate nucleic acid (RNA or DNA vaccines, a new technique for advancing vaccination).
Pilot vaccines from each of these strategies should be tested for immunity and efficacy.On 16 March 2020, the first clinical study of a vaccine with four volunteers was launched in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic fertilizer copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent recovery has been suggested as a potential challenge to make a vaccine for SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
More than 300 active clinical studies are underway in April 2020.
Currently, seven trials for malaria treatment, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, have been evaluated.
Newly-functioning antiretroviral drugs allocate much of Chinese research, with nine phase three clinical trials on remdesivir being conducted in different countries in late April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic clinical process for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine was underway, along with nominated drugs. Several existing antiviral therapies for the treatment of COVID-19 are being investigated, including ramadcivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lupinavir/ritonavir and lupinavir/ritonavir, along with interferon beta.
As of March 2020, there is empirical evidence that rheumatoid arthritis is effective.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients undergoing treatment with compassionate use of Remdeswire.
Phase III clinical studies are underway in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, which was previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China with preliminary results in February 2020.
However, there are calls for investigations by other researchers.
Health officials in Korea and China recommend using chloroquine.
However, while recommending a daily dose of 1 gram, the Wuhan Institute of Virology notes that twice that dose is very dangerous and can be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA granted doctors the authorization for the use of chloroquine and chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The Chinese 7th edition procedures include interferon, ribavirin, or umifenovir for use in the fight against COVID-19.
Early data suggest that a high dose of ribavirin is necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in labratory conditions.
After showing inhibition of low concentration of SARS-CoV-2, nitazoxane has been recommended for further study inside the body. Studies have shown that the initial synthesis of spike protein with intermembrane proteinase 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for SARS-CoV-2 to enter through interaction with ACE2 receptor.
High studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have many limitations that hinder the medical community from adopting and testing these treatment methods without further study. Slatavimer does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in laboratory conditions and does not play a role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine storm could be a problem in the later stages of COVID-19.
There is some evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have the anti-cyclone properties of cytokine. Tocilizumab has been included in the treatment guidelines following a brief study by the National Health Commission of China.
After showing positive results in people with severe disease, it undergoes a non-random phase 2 trial at the national level of Italy.
Blood tests, in combination with ferritin-serum testing, are used to diagnose the events of a cytokine storm to counter such developments, which are said to be the cause of death for many people.
Interleukin 6 receptor antagonist based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid-resistant cytokine release syndrome caused by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy, was approved by the FDA in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized or controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transmission of purified antibodies and antibodies collected from the immune system of such individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 is currently being investigated as an unvaccinated procedure.
This strategy was tested for SARS with no definite results.
Viral neutralization is a predictive action mechanism through which the treatment of passive antibodies can create a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms, such as cytotoxicity and/or antibody-dependent cell phagocytosis, are also possible.
Other types of passive antibody therapy, such as the use of synthetic monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
The production of garlic from healthy people, which includes the fluid portion of the blood from recovered patients and contains specific antibodies to the virus, can be increased to be used more quickly.
Coronavirus-related diseases, a group of highly related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Wuhan Central Hospital, was later infected and died after becoming aware of part of the spread of the virus.
