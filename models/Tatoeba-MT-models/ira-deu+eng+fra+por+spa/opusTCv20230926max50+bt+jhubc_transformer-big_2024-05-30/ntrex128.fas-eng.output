Welsh House Members Worried They Will Be Seen “Like Puppets”
There are concerns among some members of parliament about the proposal to change their title to the MWP.
This concern is due to plans to change the name to Parliament of Wales.
Members of the House of Representatives from all political spectrums are concerned that this will make them laugh.
A member of the Welsh parliament says his group is concerned that "MWP rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
In Wales, twp means fool and pwp means shit.
A member of Plaid’s party says the group is generally “not satisfied” with the nomination and has suggested other options.
A member of the Conservative Party of Wales says his group is acting “intelligently” on the name change, but also points out that MWP is verbally close to the word Muppet.
In this context, the first letter of Wells, w, is pronounced like the U in Yorkshire English.
The House Commission, which has already drafted a law on renames, said: “The final decision on any title that members are called by is, of course, an important matter for the members themselves.”
The Welsh government’s 2017 law gives the Welsh Parliament the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals in which the name of the Welsh Parliament was widely supported.
On the issue of titles for members of parliament, the Commission is more willing to use the titles of “Welsh Parliamentary Members” or WMP, but the MWP option is more supported in public consultation.
Members of parliament seem to suggest alternatives, but efforts to reach an agreement can be troubling for chairman Elaine Jones, who is expected to draft rules on the changes in a matter of weeks.
The amendments will include other changes in the workings of the House, laws related to disqualification of members of the House, and the design of the committee system.
After parliamentary negotiations, members of the House of Representatives will vote on the title they will be named.
Macedonians go to the ballot box for a referendum to change the country’s name
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change the country’s name to “North Macedonia.”
Voting calls for a decades-long dispute resolution with neighboring Greece, one of its provinces called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor reflects its claim to territory and has repeatedly objected to Macedonia’s offer of membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov has opposed the referendum and said he would not accept the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the name change is the cost to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's church were extinguished as in Harlem's struggle
Mr. Adams: “Historically, the old men I talked to said there was always a bar and a church in every corner.”
“Nothing left today.”
Mr. Adams says it’s understandable to let go of the burden.
He said: “Today, people are going through a lot of trouble.
“Sometimes it’s not a neighborhood meeting place where people go on a regular basis.”
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will return to the starting point.”
He adds that apartment buildings may be replaced by churches where residents do not contribute to the remaining holy space in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white, and so will put the day ahead when churches close, because it’s unlikely that the majority of those people who move to these apartments will join them,” she says.
Both churches were built before Harlem became a black city - by the Metropolitan Society in 1870 and the Martin Church a decade later by the white community.
The original white community of Methodists moved out of the city in the 1930s.
The black community praying nearby took on a new title for the building.
St. Martin was captured by the Black congregation led by Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of shops on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, resisting the recruitment or promotion of black people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when residents in Johnson’s Father’s neighborhood created renovation plans, they also ordered a bell set (Carillon).
Reverend David Johnson, son of Johnson’s father and successor to St. Martin, proudly called the bell “the bells of the poor.”
The expert who examined the bells in July called it something else: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also believes that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, and moved there 18 years ago to play a larger carillon at Riverside Cathedral.
Mr. Merriweather believes that St. Martin has not replaced him.
What has spread in St. Martin over the past few months has been a complex collection of mouths of architects and contractors, some of which were created by church leaders and others by the Episcopal Church.
The pastors of the prayer room – the ruling wing of the church district comprised of non-spiritual bishops – wrote a letter to the Episcopal Church in July declaring their concerns that “the Episcopal Church is seeking to transfer its expenses to the prayer room,” although the prayer room was not involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the Episcopal Church.
Some people in the church complain of lack of transparency from the Episcopal Church.
A 13-year-old boy in California was attacked by a shark when he dived to catch crabs.
Officials said on Saturday that a 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark in California.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel said in an interview with KSWB-TV in San Diego on Saturday morning that he was diving with friends who heard the boy screaming for help after half an hour and immediately swam with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hamel explains that at first he thought the boy was excited to get a lobster, but then realized he was shouting, “He bit me!
“They stung me!”
Hamel said that when he came to the boy’s side, “his entire clavicle was broken.”
He continued, “I cried out to everyone to get out of the water, ‘it’s in the shark water.’
The boy was taken to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was placed on a list of people with critical conditions.
It was not clear which shark was the attacker.
Lifeguard captain Larry Giles said in a media briefing that a shark had been found in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered injuries in the upper torso.
To investigate and maintain safety, authorities banned access to the sea for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Assinitas.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sinsbury Chain Store Designs for Entering the UK Cosmetic Market
Sinsbury has competed with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams as a chain store, with the help of specialist cosmetics assistants.
As part of a significant effort to enter the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion cosmetics market in the UK, which continues to grow (while fashion and household products sales are declining), the shelves of cosmetics will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will be created in more stores if successful next year.
Investing in supermarket-supermarket cosmetics is looking for ways to use the shelf space that was once used for TVs, microwaves, and household appliances.
Synezburi said it would double the supply of cosmetics to 3,000 products, including Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Available ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space with branded locations similar to those found in stores like Boots.
In this supermarket, cosmetic boutiques will be re-established so that most plant-friendly products – a topic increasingly sought after by young buyers.
In addition, Fragrance’s fragrance store will also have exclusive testing at two of the Sainsboro stores, the first of which opens last week in Krayadoon, southern London, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and the shift to buying small quantities of food on a daily basis in locally available stores mean that supermarkets are having to work harder to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupé, executive director of SYNSBURY, says sales markets are generally becoming more like big chain stores, and supermarkets are trying to fight off discounts on Aldi and Lidl stores by offering more services and non-food supplies.
Sainsbury’s has built several Argos stores in hundreds of shops, as well as several Habitat’s because it bought both chains two years ago, saying it boosted food sales and made shopping more profitable.
Previous attempts by supermarkets to add cosmetics and pharmacy failed.
Synesbury tried to create a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but after a less serious effort, it was difficult to figure out how to split incomes in the chemical store and the collaboration was interrupted.
The new strategy came three years ago, when Sainsbury’s sold its 281 drug stores to Celesio, the owner of Lloyd’s chain of pharmacies for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
Lloyd’s was said to play an important role by adding a wide range of luxury brands in the field of skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills Hicks, SYNSBURY Commerce Director, said: “To improve the environment for our customers, we have changed the look and feel on the shelves of cosmetic products.
We also recruited specially trained colleagues who will be there to provide advice.
“The range of brands is tailored to the needs, and the environment is incentivized and comfortable, which means we now have a beautiful, guiding place that challenges the old ways of shopping.”
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby withdraws <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Actress Peter Jones left the meeting angry after television presenter Holly Willoughby broke her <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal with her brand and decided to close her new contract with Marks, Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for household clothes and accessories with the brand Truly.
The couple’s business is similar to the Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
Instagram’s “Morning This Morning” host announced that he had left the deal.
Holly Willoughby angered the actor Peter Jones in the series Dragons Den as he left the deal at the last minute to focus on new contracts with Marks, Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones is angry when the golden-haired TV girl admitted Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, her new deal – valued at around <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – means she no longer has enough time for the Truly brand, which is active in the field of household clothing and accessories.
The business was similar to the Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and is said to double Willoughby’s wealth, which is estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
The 37-year-old said on Instagram that he broke up with Truly and Jones left the UK for one of his bungalows.
One source said: “Truly was really one of Holly’s priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term future, and they would be together in the next few decades.
His decision to shut down the company completely confused everyone.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday.
There’s a warehouse full of goods in Marlowe’s headquarters that are ready to be sold.”
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of the “Morning Today” program, one of the UK’s most lucrative stars, could cost the company millions due to the heavy investment in products from cushions and candles to household clothing.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Don Baldwin, have been in close contact with Jones and his wife Tara Cup for 10 years.
The company was founded in 2016 by the company Truly along with the Cup, and in March, the 52-year-old Jones worked as a board of directors.
The couple were together and owned 40 percent of Baldwin TV’s shares.
Willoughby wanted to become M&S’s business ambassador, replacing Anthony McPartlin, who ran the ITV program “I’m a Celebrity.”
A source close to Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his economic affairs.”
It’s hard to say, “And then we fell in love.”
He paid attention to the news media’s criticism of writing an opinion that some don’t see as “in the president’s best interest” and that he’s not joking about the North Korean leader for being positive.
Why is President Trump leaving things out so quickly?
Trump, with his funny voice, says:
“I have not abandoned anything.”
He noted that Kim had met with Trump at the second summit after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, a major step toward North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
But nuclear disarmament talks have been halted.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong-ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea did not see “a corresponding response” from the United States to advance disarmament in North Korea.
Instead, he said, the U.S. has continued to impose sanctions with the aim of maintaining pressure.
In his speech, Trump had a very optimistic view of his supporters.
“Our work with North Korea was great.
“We were at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
“Now we have a great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results - ending missile tests, helping release hostages and returning the remains of U.S. troops to the country.
And he also defended his unusual approach to talking about relations with Kim.
Referring to the crowd who heard him directly, Trump said, “It’s very easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get out of here, we have about 200 people standing there.”
An Indonesian tsunami and earthquake have devastated an island and killed hundreds of people.
For example, after the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
While more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population were homeless, the declaration of a national disaster was not a prerequisite for accelerating international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, it is very clear that international aid requests are not being made and therefore it becomes a little difficult,” Sambong said.
While the children’s rescue team is bringing together a team to travel to the city of Palo Alto, they are still not sure if foreign workers can work in those areas.
Mr Sotopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian authorities were investigating the situation in Palo to see if international organizations could be allowed to help.
Despite the landslides that are constantly taking place in Indonesia, the country is unfortunately not prepared for nature’s wrath.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, there are no shelters on other beaches.
The lack of a tsunami alarm in Palu, or even a typical alarm, was also one of the reasons for the death toll.
At best, moving between many Indonesian islands is a challenging task.
Natural disasters make supplies more difficult.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palo, but it takes at least three days to arrive at the scene.
President Joko Widodo has taken steps to improve Indonesia’s old infrastructure, which was centered on his campaign slogans, and has spent huge amounts on roads and railroads.
But the government’s lack of funding will put Mr. Joko in trouble in next year’s elections.
Joko is also facing pressure from sectarian conflicts in Indonesia, where the majority of the Muslim population has embraced a conservative form of religion.
Christian and Muslim gangs are dying in the streets using machetes, bows, spears and other violent weapons, resulting in more than 1,000 deaths and tens of thousands of homeless people.
Watch: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge prevents his team from losing against Chelsea.
Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge, with his 89-minute goal, prevented his team from defeating Chelsea on Saturday at Stamford Bridge.
Sturridge, while his team was a zero behind Chelsea, received a pass from the Chekmiri Gerdan 30 meters from the Chelsea Gate.
He pushed the ball to his left before hitting the farther side.
The high shot went from the top of the penalty area to the right of the gate.
The ball crossed the goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and finally scored.
Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com: “It was just an attempt to get to the right position to take the ball, and a player like Shaqiri always plays as far forward as possible. So I tried to create as many positions as possible.”
“I saw Kant coming and he gave the ball a rough blow, he didn’t think much about it, he just took the shot.”
Chelsea won the first half of the match by 1-0 after their 25-minute Belgian star Eden Hazard scored.
After turning near the half-field, the Blues quickly reached Liverpool's half-field and passed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic.
Kovacic gave the ball in the middle of the field and moved himself.
Then, with a beautiful deep shot, the ball reached Hazard inside the penalty area.
Hazard left the defense and shot the ball in the opposite direction with the left foot, which passed through the goalkeeper Allison Becker.
Liverpool will face off against Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paulo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
The Indonesian disaster agency said earlier on Sunday that the death toll in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami had reached 832.
A spokesman for the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said: "Many people are trapped in the ruins of buildings destroyed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake. Waves have reached up to 20 feet (6 meters).
The city of Paolo, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man for allegedly stabbed to death a woman.
A criminal investigation began this morning after a woman’s body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
At 7:55 a.m., a 44-year-old woman was found with knife wounds on her body in the Grayson Mews neighborhood of John Street, where a 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
Police have asked people to call the police if they see or hear anything.
Detective Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is in its early stages, and I’m asking those in Birkenhead, near John Street, who have seen or heard a suspicious case to contact us.
“I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have cameras recording on their dashboards, to contact us because their information may be vital to our investigation.”
A police spokeswoman confirmed that the woman whose body was found in Birkenhead was found inside the home.
This afternoon, female friends who know her were asked to come to the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
An investigation is underway and police say they are notifying someone close to the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews tried to return to his apartment, but police said no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He didn't say anything when he knew what had happened.
Residents of the building were told it could take several hours before they were allowed to enter and return home.
A police officer heard a man say the entire area is now known as a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene crying.
He kept repeating, “It’s scary.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans entered the quarantine area, while another had stopped outside the area.
A number of officers stood inside the quarantine area and monitored the building.
Those with information in the field are asked to call DM <0x40>MerPolCC at +101 or via the anti-crime communication system and anonymously by calling 0800555111 at 247 on September 30.
The Cromwell Statue in Parliament is the oldest memory hit by a “rewrite of history”
Its exile is a poetic justice for the Taliban’s destruction of many of the British cultural and religious works carried out by puritan fanatics.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick’s proposal as “stupid” and “trying to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Association, said: “At the moment, it is inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s statues will be removed outside the Westminster Palace.
The bribery of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor carried out by the Kremlin.
Perhaps Cromwell’s opposition to the law was sacrificed in the last century because of the actions of his grandfather Thomas.
The majestic display of Cromwell’s Sir William Hume Thorncroft is evidence of 19th-century beliefs and part of the historiography of a character that many believe can still be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sydney Telegraph: “Cramwell was considered by many, perhaps more people in the late nineteenth century than it is today, to be a defender of parliament’s external pressure during the kingdom.
Whether this is a completely accurate show is a continuing historical discussion.
What we are confident of is that conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the next development process of our nation, and that Cromwell is a well-known figure representing one side of the divide.
His achievements as a patron of the Lord are also worth celebrating and commemorating.”
Killing a pig with a snout kills a Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China.
According to the South China Morning Post, the man, identified only by the surname Yuan, was found near a pig in Libanshui market in Guizhou Province, with his artery amputated and full of blood.
On May 30, 2005, in Xinjiang, China, a pig farmer was preparing to vaccinate pigs.
He reportedly arrived with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found out that he was dead and that the neighbor’s pork door was open.
He said there was a large male pig in the swine, whose mouth was bloody.
According to the report, a forensic examination confirms that a 250 kg pig had attacked the farmer with a snout and caused his death.
According to the Goyang newspaper, a cousin of the victim, Wu’s surname, said: “My cousin’s legs were bloody and broken.”
A video of security cameras shows the yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed its pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed this man does not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told The Evening News that the pig was closed to prevent attacks, while police were collecting evidence from the scene.
It is reported that Yuan’s family and market officials are negotiating compensation for his death.
Previously, there have been cases of pig attacks on humans, although this is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a man and his wife on their farm.
Ten years ago, a <0xC2><0xA3>290-pound pig had beaten a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife scared the animal away.
After an organic farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that the pigs were not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood could act as a trigger.
He said, “The pigs are just playful.
They bite and are very curious...they are not out there to hurt you.
You just have to respect them as much as possible.”
Hurricane Rosa caused heavy rainfall in southwestern U.S.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa has been weakened by moving on colder waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Hurricane Rosa, a Category 1 hurricane with a wind speed of 137 km/h, occurs at 5 a.m. on Sunday morning in the U.S. East Time and is located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, low-pressure waves begin to form over the Pacific Ocean and will move east and west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the California Baja Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, extreme tropical humidity is directed northwards to the southwestern coast of the United States.
Rosa is expected to rain on Monday in parts of Mexico up to 250 millimeters.
Then tropical moisture interacting with low-pressure waves in the coming days will cause heavy rainfall in the southwest.
25 to 100 mm of rain locally causes dangerous flooding, flooding with waste and possibly landslides in the plains.
Extreme tropical humidity will increase rainfall in some places, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona, to 50 to 75 mm per hour.
It is expected to rain about 50 to 100 mm in parts of the southwest, especially in many parts of Arizona.
Due to the dispersed nature of tropical rains, sudden flooding occurs and the situation is rapidly deteriorating.
Due to the risk of tropical rainfall, it is strongly recommended to avoid walking in the plains.
Heavy rains cause deep valleys to turn into roaring rivers, and storms cause winds to blow along with dust.
The waves will cause heavy local rainfall in parts of the southern coast of California.
Rainfall of more than 12 mm is likely to cause the water to flow along with waste and sliding roads.
This will be the first rainfall in a wet season.
Spreading tropical rainfall occurs late on Sunday and early Monday in Arizona, which will become more widespread later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will reach the Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
In October, extreme temperature changes are observed throughout the United States as the Arctic cools, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this condition leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
On Sunday, a great example of temperature difference will occur across the entire central part of the United States.
Approximately 20-degree temperature differences will occur between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, St. Louis, and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the heat will remain late in the summer and will rise again.
Many parts of the central and eastern United States are expected to have warmer days in early October, with temperatures up to 27<0xC2><0xB0>C in the southern plains to the northeastern parts.
New York City’s temperature could reach 27<0xC2><0xB0>C on Tuesday, which would be about 6<0xC2><0xB0>C above average.
Weather forecasts in the first half of October suggest the likelihood of higher-than-average temperatures in the eastern United States is high.
More than 20 million people attended Bert Kavanaugh's hearing.
More than 20 million people on six television channels on Thursday witnessed evidence presented to him by Christine Blasi Ford of the alleged sexual assault of Brett Kavanaugh in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political dissent continued and regular television broadcasts were interrupted until the last minute Friday: a deal designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake with the FBI to investigate the charges for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had touched him drunk and tried to take off his clothes at the high school party.
Kavanaugh says he’s 100 percent sure it didn’t happen.
More than 20.4 million people are likely to have watched the incident reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company counted the average number of viewers on the news channels CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC.
Figures for other networks showing the event, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
Nielsen usually does not have the ability to count the people who watched the program in offices.
To visualize it, this audience size is almost the same size as the viewers of a football game or the Oscars.
Nielsen said Fox News, whose executives strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had an average of 5.69 million viewers, ahead of all other networks.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen CBS, NBC, MSNBC and CNN had 3.1 million viewers, 2.94 million, 2.89 million and 2.52 million viewers, respectively.
The attention and interest of the audience remained after the hearing.
Flick played the lead role in Friday’s play.
After the moderate Republican office announced that it would vote in Kavanaugh’s favor, CNN and CBS cameras showed him on Friday as he headed for the court’s elevators, amid a mob of dissent.
He stood with depressed eyes for a few minutes while others scolded him and the scene was broadcast live on CNN.
One woman said, “I’m standing right in front of you.”
“Do you think he’s telling the truth to the people?
The man said, “When many women are weak, you are powerful.”
Flick said his office issued a statement saying he wanted more things to say at the committee hearing before the elevator was closed.
Cable and broadcast networks covered this while the Judiciary Committee was voting for Kavanaugh’s nomination in the Senate.
But Flick said he had only done so by understanding that the FBI was backed by minority Democrats on charges against the candidate for next week.
Flick was somewhat convinced after a conversation with his friend Chris Cowens, who is a Democratic senator.
After talking with Cowens and several other senators, Flick made his decision.
Flick’s election had power because it was clear that Republicans could not vote for Kavanaugh’s approval without an investigation.
President Trump has asked the FBI to open an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Accuses Critics of ‘Political Game’ on Brexit
British Prime Minister Theresa May said in an interview with the Sunday Times that critics of the EU withdrawal plan are “playing a political game” with the future of the UK, which would hurt national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived in Birmingham on September 29, 2018, to attend the Conservative Party conference.
In an interview with the newspapers, former Secretary of State Boris Johnson spoke of his attack on the checkers program for Brexit, suggesting that Britain and the EU should raise their “absolutely irrational” tariffs.
Dead Sims: Police Arrest Dayton Simpson Accused of Killing LSU Player
Police have arrested a suspect in a deadly shooting at 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wade Sims.
Baton Rouge Police Department says 20-year-old Dayton Simpson has been arrested and jailed for second-degree murder.
Officials released a video of a confrontation between Simpson and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during a fight.
CBS-affiliated WAFB reports said police found the glasses at the crime scene and had Simpson’s DNA on them.
After interrogating Simpson, police said Simpson agreed to shoot Width.
According to the lawyer, his bail is $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner’s office released a preliminary report on Friday, citing the cause of death as a gunshot to the head and neck.
The department had sought help from the Louisiana State Police Task Force, the Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and District Citizens in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alvaro, LSU Sports Affairs Director, thanked the lawmakers for their "harshness and pursuit of justice" in the region.
The Sims was 20 years old.
The forward grew to a height of 1 meter and 98 cm in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played for the LSU basketball team.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was “devastated” and “in shock” as a result of Vvid’s death.
He said, “That’s what you have to worry about.
Mountains spread their ashes in Mexico City.
The volcanic ashes of the Mount Popocatepetl reach southern neighborhoods of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Accident Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the mountain, and recorded 183 eruptions of gas and ashes in 24 hours.
The center has recorded several roars and vibrations in its systems.
Images on social media show that in some neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Xochimilco, a thin layer of glass ashes is covered.
Since the 7.1 magnitude earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists have noticed an increase in the volcanic activity of the mountain, located 72 km southeast of the capital.
The volcano, known as Don Guio, has been active since 1994.
On the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote, police clashed with Catalan separatists
Six people were arrested on Saturday during a clash between pro-independence protesters and riot police in Barcelona, when thousands of protesters joined a rival group to mark the first anniversary of an election in Catalonia.
A group of separatists held back by the anti-revolt police began throwing eggs and spraying powdery dyes, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, usually accompanied by crowds of tourists.
When the police surrounded the protesters using batons, the fighting escalated again.
For more than a few hours, pro-independence groups had lined up with the slogan “No Forgiveness, No Forgiveness” against unionists who shouted “Long live Spain.”
The local press reported that 14 people were treated for minor injuries during the demonstrations.
Tensions in the region are still high a year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considers illegal, but the anniversary is celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters decided to secede entirely, although the number of voters in the election was low and opponents of the secession boycotted voting.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year after police tried to stop voting in districts across the region.
Pro-independence groups sat down on Friday to prevent demonstrations backed by the National Police.
The demonstrators were moving forward, but they had to take a different path.
The 68-year-old electrician, Narcissus Termes, who has been involved in separatist protests with his wife, said he no longer hoped Catalonia’s expectations of independence would be met.
“Last year we had one of the best moments of our lives.
I watched my parents cry because they could vote, but now we’re dead."
Despite managing that vital victory following last December’s regional elections, Catalan pro-independence parties failed to continue their movement this year, many of their well-known leaders remain in exile or detention, awaiting trial for their role in organizing a referendum and proclaiming independence.
Juan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who is filming the demonstrations on the phone under the protection of police, said the dispute between politicians on both sides was deadlocked.
He said, “There’s more and more tension.”
On Saturday, Uriel Jankoeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in temporary detention since late last year, announced that he would participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
“A move to run for the European Parliament is the best democratic way to condemn the repression and repression that we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
London: A man was arrested after a house was destroyed by car
Three 33-year-olds, 34-year-olds and 39-year-olds were arrested after their car was slammed into a London door.
The incident took place on Thursday at around 19:30 British time in Balingrad Crescent.
Detective Bob Belming said the damage to the doors and the building itself had entered.
In some places, it was also shot by a bow in the car.
Menga with his goal led Livingstone to win the Rangers 1-0.
Dalí Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the team's victory
Livingston confused the Rangers, and Steven Gerrard suffered his second defeat in 18 games as manager of Abbex.
Dalí Menga's goal led Livingston to take over Greyholt over Hybrinian.
Gerrard has not won the Premier League this season and will play with Hertz, who has eight points, next Sunday.
Prior to that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has increased its invincibility to six games by coaching Holt who succeeded Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston lost his chance against his guest.
The Hult team worked before they hit the goal offensively, and their direct shots caused the Rangers trouble.
Scott Robinson broke the line of defenders, but his attempt against the goal remained fruitless, after which Alan Littgoff was only able to divert his shot to the open to reach Craig Hulket along the goal.
The host team was happy to play against the Rangers and knew they could get the other team into trouble in parts of the game.
And they were able to do that with the flower.
Livingston got a free kick, the ball reached manga from Declan Galacer and Robinson, and he entered the goal through the penalty area.
Up until that point, the Rangers had possession of the ball, but the defense of the host team was unbreakable, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly did largely without mistakes.
This trend continued in the second half, though Liam Kelly managed to contain the Alfredo Morellos ball.
Scott Pittman was stopped by Alan McGregor, the Rangers' goalkeeper, and Lightgoff also kicked out for Livingston.
The strikes were constantly directed towards the Livingston penalty area, but they were all repulsed. The Rangers team claimed a penalty twice - once after Hulkett's error on the Golden Middleton substitute player and one for the ball's touch.
"Excellent Work" Livingston - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland reporter at Tony Macaroni Stadium
Excellent performance and result for Livingston.
In my opinion, they were excellent, still better than expectations in this uptrend.
The style of the game and their team has changed very little since their return to peak, but the main honor is the Hoult, who has been wearing it after entering the team.
He had many heroes.
Captain Hulkett was excellent and organized the defense very well, while Menga was able to defeat Conor Goldson and Joe Veral.
However, the Rangers team was not impressed.
As good as they were at Gerard’s time, they are now far from these standards.
They didn’t have the final finisher – they only managed to open the host team’s defense once – and that’s a warning for the Rangers, who are now in the middle of the table.
Dual reception of Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday, the leaders of Turkey and Germany met with a smile in the blue sky of Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to reform relations with NATO allies.
They discussed human rights, press freedom and Turkey’s membership in the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new, very large mosque.
The city has the largest population of foreigners in Turkey.
Police prevented a gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque for security reasons, but a large number of supporters gathered near the mosque to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of whom were Kurdish – began chanting slogans, condemning Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to accept him in the country.
The demonstrations between the two opposing groups represent a distinction between the two groups of German Turks, some who see Erdogan as a hero and others who insult him as a tyrannical ruler.
Road accident in Deptford: A cyclist dies in car accident
A cyclist died in a collision with a car in London.
The crash occurred in the southeast of the city, at the intersection of Bedwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, around 10:15 p.m.
The driver stopped and emergency services arrived at the scene, but the man died at the scene.
The accident occurred a few months after another accident on Childers Street, about a mile away from the site of Saturday’s crash, which resulted in the death of the biker.
Metropolitan police said officers were investigating the matter to identify the cyclist and inform his close relatives.
Roads have been closed and bus routes have been changed, and drivers are advised not to cross the area.
Long Lartin Prison Officials: Six Officers Injured in Chaos
According to the prison office, six prison officers were injured in a disturbance in a high-security male prison.
The riots at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire occurred at 9:30 British time on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Tornado’s specialty officers have taken action to deal with the chaos involving eight inmates who are trapped in a corner.
Officers were treated for minor injuries to the face.
A spokesperson for the prison service said: “Specially trained personnel have been deployed at HMP Long Lartin to deal with possible incidents.
Six of the workers were injured and were treated.
“We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the perpetrators are being handed over to the police and may spend more time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, some of whom are among the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was taken to the hospital after a prisoner was attacked.
And in October last year, counter-insurgency officers were called into prison to deal with a serious turmoil, where staff were attacked with billiard cannons.
The threat of sudden flooding by hurricane Rosa in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (dry areas may benefit from rainfall)
It’s rare to see a drop in tropical pressure reach Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s likely to happen early next week, with the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa passing through the southwestern Sahara and the risk of a sudden flood.
The National Weather Service for Mondays and Tuesdays in West Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, southeast of California, and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, has predicted a sudden sewage outbreak.
Rosa is expected to make her way to Phoenix on Tuesday, causing rain there later on Monday.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix noted through a topographic message that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have caused tropical storms or low-pressure conditions about 320 kilometers from Phoenix!
Hurricane Katrina (1976) was a hurricane 65 kilometers from the Arizona state border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict that it will rain 50 to 100 mm, up from 150 mm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
In other parts of the southwestern Sahara, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is likely to rain 25 to 50 millimeters, which may be as high as 100 millimeters in total.
For areas that are far away from the dangers of sudden flooding, Rosa rain may benefit as these areas suffer from drought.
Although flooding is a serious concern, it is likely to be useful for some areas of the rainy season, as the southwestern region is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the Drought Monitoring Center and Weather.com, more than 40 percent of Arizona’s areas are in severe drought conditions, the second-highest category.
Initially, the path of Hurricane Rosa is towards the Baja Peninsula of California in Mexico.
Rosa, still a hurricane, is at a maximum wind speed of 137 km/h on Sunday morning, 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at 20 mph.
The storm continues to encounter colder waters in the Pacific Ocean, thus depriving it of power.
Therefore, it is expected to show its strength in the afternoon or Monday night in Mexico’s tropical storm.
Rainfall in different parts of Mexico can be severe and the risk of flooding is significant.
According to weather.com, “The total rainfall from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora is 75 to 150 mm, which may be as high as 150 mm.”
Rosa then travels north from Mexico as a tropical storm, reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a low-pressure tropical region, and heading south of Utah in late Tuesday after crossing Arizona.
According to the National Hurricane Center, “the main anticipated danger from Rosa and its remnants include extreme rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States.”
These rains are expected to cause sudden, life-threatening flooding in the desert and landslides in the mountains.
Attaque at Midsummer Northen: Four suspects arrested for attempted murder
After a 16-year-old boy was found with knife wounds in Somerset, three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder.
A teenage boy was found injured in the Greater Middlesbrough area of Norton on Saturday at 4:00 British time.
He was taken to a hospital where he survived in “sustainable” conditions.
Police said Evan and Somerset, a 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man, were arrested at night in the Radosk area.
Police officers have asked people who may have recorded a video of what happened on the phone to go to the police.
Trump Says Kavanaugh Is “Deep and Furious” at Democratic Party
In a speech in West Virginia, Trump said: “Voting Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the oppressive and oppressive tactics of the Democratic Party.
Trump says Kavanaugh was upset by the Democratic Party’s “post and anger” during his election process.
Prior to the congressional hearing on Thursday, Kavanaugh said he strongly rejected Christine Blasi Ford’s claim that she had sexually assaulted him decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also testified at the hearing on his claim.
President Trump said on Saturday that “the American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh” on that day.
He told a large crowd of his supporters in West Virginia: “Vote for the approval of Judge Kavanaugh, one of the most famous legal professionals of our time, who is a full-fledged legal expert in public service.”
While talking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections, the president implicitly mentioned Kavanaugh.
“Five weeks remain to be one of the most important elections in our lifetime.
He said, “I’m not on the ballot, but I’m on the ballot.”
“That’s why I’m here and I’m fighting for great candidates.”
Trump claimed that the Democrats’ mission was to “create resistance and obstruction.”
A senior GOP adviser told CNN that the first procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place on Friday.
Hundreds of people have been killed in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia and the death toll seems to rise
Officials said on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed by the earthquake and tsunami on Indonesia's Sulawesi Island, with huge waves on the coast.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered to participate in a festival on the coast of the city of Palo, which suddenly took a large number at sunset of waves up to six meters (18 feet) and drowned them, destroying everything on their way.
A tsunami followed an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Organization (BNPB), said at a press conference in Jakarta: “Yesterday, when the tsunami threat occurred, people did not stop working on the beach and did not run away immediately, so they became victims.”
“The tsunami that came, pulled cars, cartridges, and houses, and destroyed everything on the ground,” Nogruo said, adding that the tsunami was sailing at 800 kilometers per hour (497 miles per hour) before it reached the coastline.
He said some people climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated from their homes and settled in 24 centers in Palo.
Aerial photos released by the National Disaster Organization show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have collapsed, and a mosque is surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the aftershocks continued in the coastal city.
This series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy emitted by the massive earthquake on Friday had about 200 times the power of the Hiroshima atomic bomb in World War II.
It is said that the geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami.
The group described the damage as “extensive” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of the demolished buildings, with more than 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nogoro said the casualties and damage may be greater along the 300km coastline north of Palu, an area called Dangala, which is close to the epicenter of the quake.
Nogodo said the communications were "completely interrupted and there was no information" about Dangala.
The Red Cross said in a statement that more than 300,000 people live there and that the organization’s staff and volunteers have been dispatched to the area.
“It’s a disaster, but it could have been much worse.”
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for not notifying that a tsunami was approaching Palo, but officials said the waves had reached the coast when the warning was issued.
In amateur videos shared on social media, a man’s voice is heard on the top floor of a building, warning the people on the street that a tsunami is approaching.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water hits the beach, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the film's authenticity.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power outages and communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
Officials said the army had sent aid from Jakarta and other cities by cargo planes, but the homeless still had a severe need for food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport is only open for relief efforts and closed for other purposes until October.
President Joko Widodo visited the accommodation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia has increased to more than 800.
Things are very bad.
Mr. Doseba said World Vision staff from Donggala had secured the status of the city of Palu, in which staff had installed tent shelters in their office yard and were informed of the devastation scenes.
"They announced that many of the houses had been destroyed."
Things are very bad.
While relief groups have begun their move to mitigate disasters with the help of available tools, some have complained that sending high-profile foreign aid to Palo could be prevented.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, resources and human resources from abroad are only possible if declared a national disaster in the affected region.
But that announcement hasn’t happened yet.
Avlia Arianni, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross, said: “This incident is still a disaster at the provincial level.”
“Once the government accepts, it can be declared a national disaster. Then the path to international aid is opened, but such a situation does not yet exist.”
Despite the two nights of the Friday earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and family of the missing remain hopeful that a miracle will happen to their loved ones and change the story of this tragic natural disaster.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman trapped under the rubble and spent two days with her mother’s body.
Gondon Subando is the coach of two missing Paragliding athletes who were trained for the Asian Games. The tournament ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other people trapped at the hotel included Mr. Mandagi and his students.
“As a senior coach in Paragliding, I’m under a lot of emotional pressure.”
Mr. Gandon explained that he was worried about his students a few hours after the hotel was demolished and sent messages to rivals at the Palo Beach Festival in the Paraglider Forum via WhatsApp.
However, her messages received only a grey tick instead of a pair of blue tick marks.
“I think the grey tick means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 when transferring money to an ATM in Newport, Levee
According to the Newport Police Center, robbers stole $26,750 from Brink’s staff on Friday morning when transferring money to an ATM in Newport, Levee.
Detective Dennis McCarthy said the driver was unloading an ATM and preparing to deliver money at an entertainment center.
While he was busy, another man ran “through the back of the employee of Brink” and stole a bag of money for delivery.
According to the news, witnesses identified several suspects who fled the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved.
Persons with information about the identity of the burglars should contact Newport Police at 3,680-292-859.
Kenny West: Rap singer who changed his name to Ye
The rapper Kenny West changed his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, writing, “My official name is Kenny West.”
West, 41, was once nicknamed Ye and used the nickname for his eighth album, which will be released in June.
The name change was announced before he appeared on Saturday Night Live, where he announced that he would soon be making his new album, Yandhi.
The producer announced that she would replace the former singer Ariana Grande, who had canceled the show for “emotional reasons.”
Ye stands for West’s current professional name, and he says the word is of religious significance to him.
Earlier this year, West told Big Boy Radio: “I believe you is the word most used in the Bible, which means you.
“I’m going to be you, I’m going to be you, I’m going to be us and we’re going to be you.
I will change your name, which means only Ye, to reflect our good, our bad, our confusion and everything.
This album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of the few famous rappers to have changed his name.
Sean Combs, for example, is known by various names like Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he was more willing to call himself Love and Brother Love.
West's former colleague, Jay-Z, is also known as either with or without a dashed line and letters, large or small.
Mexican President Amlo has vowed not to use the military against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador has vowed to never use military force against civilians as the 50th anniversary of the bloody massacre.
López Obrador promised at the Tlatelloco Palace on Saturday that he would “never use the military to suppress the Mexican people.”
During the peaceful demonstrations on October 2, 1968, and when leftist student movements were growing across Latin America, soldiers opened fire on the population, killing 300 people.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support Mexican youth by providing monthly subsidies to those studying and opening public universities.
Unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people to be drawn to criminal gangs, he said.
The U.S. needs to double its artificial intelligence (AI) funding.
Kai Fu Li, an AI investor and activist working at Google, Microsoft, and Apple, says that as China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its investment in research.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. government issued statements about AI, and that the U.S. generally lacked an official AI strategy.
While China announced its plan last year, their goal is to rank first in AI innovations by 2030.
“Doubling AI research funding would be a good start, given that other countries are far away from the United States and we are looking forward to the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that doubling the investment could double the chances that AI will succeed in the future of the United States.
Li is the author of the book “The Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order,” which was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. He is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated the U.S. Othello champion.
Lee appreciates technology competitions held in the previous U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge conducted by the Defense Department's Agency for Advanced Research Projects, and calls for cases like this in the future to help identify future dreams.
Lee says that researchers in the U.S. often work hard to get government assistance.
Li said, “It’s not China that has made academic researchers; it’s the companies that do it.”
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired university faculty to work on AI.
Lee said a change in immigration policies could also help the U.S. bolster its efforts in the field of AI.
He says I think people who have a PhD in AI should be given a green card automatically.
China’s State Council released its next-generation artificial intelligence development program in July 2017.
According to Li, the National Science Foundation of China is funding people at academic institutions, which is similar to what the National Science Foundation and other government agencies do for U.S. researchers, but the quality of scientific work is lower in China.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a joint AI center that aims to build collaboration between industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of an AI Selection Committee.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a project called AI Next.
And in the case of NSF, it has already invested over $100 million in AI research.
But U.S. law, which sought to set up a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has not done much in recent months.
Macedonians in a referendum say they want to change their country’s name or not.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum on Sunday to change the country’s name to the “North Macedonian Republic,” a move that will resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has prevented the country from becoming a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents a kind of claim on its territory, and has vetoed Macedonia’s entry into NATO and the European Union.
The two governments agreed in June on a new name, but nationalist opponents believe the change will weaken the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slavic Macedonians.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the campaign to boycott the referendum raised doubts about whether the number of voters would reach the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot is: “Do you agree to accept the agreement with Greece and to join NATO and the European Union?”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zerman Zaev, believe that Macedonia, one of the resulting countries from the collapse of Yugoslavia, will have to pay to enter the EU and NATO.
79-year-old Olivera Giorgiovska, who lives in Skopje, said: “I am here today to vote for the future of my country, for the young Macedonians, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because we will all be safer.”
Members of parliament have said in sufficient numbers that they are committed to the outcome of the election, although legally this is not necessary.
A change of name requires a two-thirds majority.
The provincial election commission said there were no reports of violations by 1 p.m.
However, the number of voters in the referendum did not exceed 16 percent, compared with about 66 percent of registered voters in the recent parliamentary elections in 2016.
The 62-year-old, one of the voters in the capital, Josie Tanowski, said: “I voted for my children, we are in Europe.”
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dashko voted in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018, to open the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepares a small platform and places the seats in front of tents set up by people boycotting the referendum.
“We belong to NATO and the EU, but we want to join them proudly, not through the back door.”
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
“If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can go back to others like China and Russia and be part of an integrated European and Asian community.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership is a huge investment for a country with an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
After the vote, Zapoff said, “I believe that the majority of people are in favor of this because more than 80 percent of our citizens want the EU and NATO.”
He said the answer would be “yes, it will be an affirmation of our future.”
A poll published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research last Monday found that between 30 and 43 percent of eligible voters would take part in the referendum—that’s less than quota.
Another poll conducted by the Macedonian television network Telma shows that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote yes.
To be successful in the referendum, a 50 percent quorum plus one vote is required.
The failure of the referendum is the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policies, which came to power in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero passes out of all the defending teams and scores the ball.
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling broke the defense at Manchester United on Monday to win the game with a 2-0 result.
At the 65th minute, Aguero slammed the ball into the other team’s goal.
The Argentine striker at the beginning of the resumption received a pass on the midfield.
He quickly passed through the three defenders of Brighton and opened the space for himself.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four green players.
He drew the defense around with his moves on the edge of the penalty area.
He then passed to his left, which reached Sterling.
The English forward returned the ball to Aguero with one shot inside the field, and he struck the ball with his right foot, defeating goalkeeper Matthew Ryan Brighton and slamming the ball against the right wall of the gate.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters: “Aguero has some problems in his legs.”
"We talked about him playing 55 to 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to win a goal at the same time.”
But it was Sterling who first scored the Premier League for Sky Blues in this match.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Agüero received the ball in the depths of Brighton's field.
He brought the ball beautifully to Laurie Sen from the left side.
Before Sterling went further, Sean struck the ball several times.
The sky blue forwards, right at the gate, clasped the ball to the net.
The City of the Champions League group game series will face Haffenheim at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play as spoiler against Rockies
Although the Nationals team has been eliminated from the play-offs, there’s not much reason to try to get another start.
But Scherzer’s rival team always hopes to win the game against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if it has the concept of a playoff for the Rockies, which has been a game more than the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West National League.
Rockies won at least one Wild Card on Friday night with a 5–2 victory against Nationals, but they still plan to take the first title.
“Although we’re playing for nothing, at least we can touch the ball, knowing what the atmosphere here in Denver is like, and the other team will probably play at the highest level we’ve ever faced.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate in that competition?”
The Nationals team should announce a starter for Sunday’s game, but it has been reported that they would like to post Scherzer.
Scherzer, which can have its 34th start, has a kick-off training session on Thursday and a normal break on Sunday.
Washington's right-handed player is: 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 shots in 220 2.3 rounds this season.
Trump's speeches in West Virginia
President Trump spoke implicitly about the situation surrounding the Supreme Court and Brett Kavanaugh, as well as about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“We’re going to gamble all our gains in November.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections in our lifetime.
“This election is one of the biggest and it’s big – I’m not running for office, but I’m actually here because I’m fighting for candidates.”
Trump continued, “You see this terrible group, these terrible radical democrats, you see these things happening right now.
They are determined that by using whatever means they need to gain power, you will see the subjugation of these and the filth of this group.
They don’t care who gets hurt in this campaign, who they throw away to gain power and control, that’s what they want: power and control, but we don’t want to give them both.”
He said the Democrats’ mission is to “create resistance and obstruction.”
"And you see how angry, vile, vile, and inappropriate the Democrats have been called over the last four days," he said.
He pointed to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee and Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein about how the audience hugged him.
“Do you remember his answer?
Have you read the documents that leaked out?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
“No, no, I’ll wait – body language was really bad – the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer a broad church.
For those who support freedom of speech, this is unacceptable.
When Momentum activists in the local party voted critically for me, I was not surprised.
After all, I was the last in line of Labour MPs who didn’t welcome it – all for the sake of freedom of expression.
My parliamentary colleague Joanne Ryan had seen the same behavior, as she stood strongly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for opposing Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of a policy on the economy, on national security, on Europe, there are similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In the announcement of the Labour summit in East Nottingham on Friday, it was announced that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
In my eight years as a local Labour representative, that was exactly what the GC meeting was like on Friday night.
Unfortunately, this tone is not seen in many meetings today, and the promise of a “more kind and gentler” policy has long been forgotten if it had begun.
It is widely seen that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and the views are judged on whether it is acceptable for party leadership.
This phenomenon began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when I used to think I was sharing a similar political theory with his colleagues, they thought I was going to circumvent them, and they had positions about national security or the single market of the EU that I never agreed with.
Whenever I speak in public — and it doesn’t really matter what I say — it’s a harsh speech about misuse of social media that calls for no choice, condemning the politics of the center, telling me I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And that just didn't happen to me.
In fact, I know I’m more lucky than some of my colleagues because the opinions they give about me are political.
I am exposed to the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a flood of sexual abuse or racism every day but are not ashamed at all.
One of the frustrating aspects of this era of politics is that abuse has become natural to a certain level.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should develop a culture of tolerance for other words.
The fact is that we are no longer a broad church, and the party becomes more limited by any move resulting from “distrust” or changing the rules of choice.
I’ve had a lot of advice over the past two years that makes me cringe, I don’t have anything to say, and I just say, okay.
But that’s not what I’m into politics for.
I joined the Labour Party as a schoolboy 32 years ago, which was fueled by the Thatcher government's encouragement. It caused me to officially lose high school classrooms, and I was trying to provide better public services to those who needed it -- no matter if I was a council member or a government minister.
I have never hidden my politics, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham gets confused about the political positions and disputes I have with my current leadership.
To those who encouraged the move on Friday, I can only say that when the country is working hard toward a Brexit that is damaging our households, businesses and public services, I have no desire to waste time and energy on loyalty to the Labour leader.
But really one of my messages that hasn’t reached Nottingham Momentum, and to members of the House, whether it’s Labour or otherwise, is this: I’m proud to serve you, and I promise you that no threatening choice or political expediency will deter me from doing something that I believe will benefit all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr invincible
Trying in the last two stages may somewhat change the end result, but there’s no doubt that Ayer deserved this extraordinary and interesting victory in the Tennant Rugby League.
They are currently at the top of the table and the only team that hasn’t lost on one side yet.
Ultimately, it was their top defense, and the accompanying odds that they were able to win the host team, and coach Peter Murcie was right to be satisfied.
“We were tested during the tournament and we haven’t lost yet, so we have to be happy.”
Robin Christie of Melrose said, “Well done to Ayr, they took their chances better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's attempt was completed by Frizer Clemeau in the 14th minute and pushed Ayer forward, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes was given for the game by the Warriors, and Jason Baggott did not make a non-passing effort.
Climo struck the leading player with a penalty kick, before, right in the middle of the game, scoring a goal after that with a solo pass, resulting in a 17 to 5 victory for Ire.
But Melrose made a good start in the second half, and Patrick Anderson’s attempt to pass Bagot reduced the difference to five points.
Then, due to Ruaridh Knott's severe injury, the game was halted for a long time, after resuming, through the effort of Stafford McDowell, by Pass Climo, Iro again extended the distance.
After that, Blair McPherson, Captain Ayer, got a yellow card and again Melrose lost another player due to Bruce Colin's effort at the end of an intense push.
However, the host team went back to the game, and when Stravan Hutchinson got a yellow card for tackling the Clima without a ball, McPherson fell behind the attacking group of Ayr Touch Down.
Clemeau gave a quick pass, as he did at the start, after Kyle took a shot inside the David Armstrong yard, and the striker removed Grigory Henry from the fifth zone of the host.
Still Game star looking for a new career in the restaurant industry
It seems that after it was discovered that Ford Kaczyn, actor Still Game, is moving to the restaurant industry as the manager of a licensed restaurant.
The 56-year-old played Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he also wrote, and has long collaborated with Wolf Hamfil as a comedy couple.
The two have announced that the next series, the ninth series, will be the last of the series, and Kirnan appears to be planning his own life after Krigalang.
According to the official registration lists, he will be the director of Adriftmoren with a limited liability.
The actor declined to comment, although Scottish Sun said Kirnan was looking to enter the business of the “booming restaurants” in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, which has no seas, hopes the court will open the way for the country to the Pacific Ocean
Seafarers are guarding the navy headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings, the flag of the blue ocean is raised.
On the naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon, the slogan reads: “The sea is our right.
“Returning it is a duty.”
Across Bolivia, where there is no sea, the memory of the loss of the coastline and its delivery to Chile, which led to a bloody 19th-century war, is still alive — just like the passion for sailing in the Pacific.
These hopes have reached their highest level in decades, as Bolivia awaits an international court ruling on October 1, after five years of intense trial.
The Bolivian diplomat, Roberto Calzadella, said: “Bolivia is moving, the spirit of unity and peace is reigning, and of course, waiting for positive results.”
Many Bolivians across the country are watching the ICJ verdict on large screens, hoping that the Hague Court – after decades of negotiations – will vote in favor of Bolivia’s claim and force Chile to sit at the negotiating table on Bolivia’s dominance and access to the sea.
Bolivia’s charismatic and indigenous president Evo Morales, who faces a tough battle for re-election next year, has been maneuvering on Monday’s ruling.
In late August, he promised, “We’ll be back in the Pacific soon.”
But some analysts believe the court is unlikely to make a decision in Bolivia’s favor – and if it does, it will be accompanied by a bit of change.
The U.N. court, headquartered in the Netherlands, has no authority to grant a portion of Chilean territory, and the court’s decision cannot determine the outcome of the negotiations.
Paz Zarate, an international law expert in Chile, said the ICJ court’s ruling came just six months after the arguments were heard, indicating the case was “not complicated.”
And far from Bolivia’s additional conflicts, the past four years may have brought it back.
“The issue of access to the sea has been abused by the current Bolivian government,” Zárate said.
He believes that Morales’ adventurous rhetoric has undermined Chile’s goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to debate on some points, but after that it will be very difficult to continue.
The two countries have had no ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Voltais, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the notion that the court’s decision would have unusual speed.
On Monday, Bolivia will have a "great opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile," he said, and an opportunity to end its 139-year dispute over mutual benefits.
Calzadilla also made the case that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents of Latin American countries – used the maritime issue as a political leverage to his advantage.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean.
“It’s an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won’t happen unless it can trust the United States
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, has said that until the country can trust Washington, it will never destroy its nuclear weapons.
Ray made the remarks at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to follow through on the promises made during the two countries’ summit in Singapore.
The remarks point to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who appears to be resuming deadlocked talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore more than three months ago.
Ray said that continuing U.S. sanctions and protests to declare an end to the Korean War would bring North Korea to its knees as one of the “inaccessible dreams.”
Washington will be very cautious about the deal as long as Pyongyang does not make a serious move toward disarmament.
Kim and U.S. President Trump both called for a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about removing nuclear arsenals that are likely to be the only way to ensure the country’s security.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris Fashion Shows Last Line of Very Large Hats on High Street Near You
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely avoid sunlight, you don’t have to look much.
The fashion designer Valentino and Tom Brown presented a series of very large hats for the SS19 series that dazzled the design style of the Paris Fashion Week.
The impractical hats filled Instagram in the summer, and the designers showcased their eye-catching creations on the dress show.
The drawing by Valentino was a beige hat on the head, decorated with a wide, feathered edge that covered the head of the model ladies.
Other items that were too big included decorated watermelon, a magic hat, and even an ananas, but they weren’t designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also featured a series of exotic masks that were only used during Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks covered the lips and were more reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter than the dress design.
One of the designs was similar to a diving hat, which was accompanied by breathing tubes and swimming glasses, and the other one was watered like ice cream.
And if you can wear these weird hats and everyone looks at you, then luck is on you.
Lightwatchers predict that these large hats will be able to make their way to street stores near you.
Oversized hats in the heel of "La Bomba", a 60-centimeter wide mattress hat seen on people's heads from Rihanna to Emily Rajakovsky.
The school of thought labeled behind the highly non-functional hats scattered across social media sent a great creative shoefish spot - a beach sack of mattress that is roughly the size of the swim mattress model that carries it.
The burnt orange ribbon bag with a white leather handle was the main design in the Jacquemus 'La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous fashion expert Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “These big hats and beach bags are expected to be available in street stores next summer – since the designer has made such a huge impact, the demand for large accessories can’t be ignored.”
John Edwards: Language skills are essential for citizens in the global arena
Scottish Independent Schools are highly academically ranked and continued in 2018 with excellent results on exams, only reinforced by individual and collective successes in sports, arts, music and other social affairs of the community.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), these schools strive to provide the best service to students and their parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare students for postgraduate and higher education, elective careers and their place as citizens in the global arena.
As an educational department that can design and implement a customized curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a favorite subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you will enter his mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, your words will enter his heart.”
It is an important point that to build relationships and trust with people from other countries, we cannot rely solely on English.
From this year’s exam results, we can see that foreign language lessons are at the top of the league table with the highest acceptance rates in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who study foreign languages earned an excellent grade of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS school members shows that 72 percent of students who studied Mandarin Chinese earned a higher A, as well as 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish.
The statistics show that independent schools in Scotland view foreign languages as a vital skill for children and young people who will undoubtedly need it in the future.
Foreign languages are now taken seriously and taught as a lesson, in the same proportion as STEM courses (science, technology, engineering and math) in the curriculum of independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the British Commission on Employment and Skill found that out of the requirements of employers for employment, 17% were related to a lack of language skills in the set.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more important to prepare young people for future careers.
Given future job opportunities that require language, we can see how much these skills are needed in the global arena.
Regardless of the profession a person chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future that they can use for a lifetime.
The ability to communicate directly with foreign people automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75% of people do not have the ability to speak a foreign language, and French is the only two-digit language that 15% of the population can speak.
That’s why investing in language education is important for today’s children.
Knowing different languages, especially those in developing countries, increases children’s chances of finding the right job.
Within Scotland, different schools teach different languages.
A number of schools focus on classic modern languages, while others teach languages that will be of greater importance to the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
No matter what language your child is interested in, there are several languages to choose from in schools and training staff who are experts in this area are also available.
Scottish Independent Schools are moving towards providing a learning environment to prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed in the future.
In today’s global business environment, it is impossible to deny the vital importance of foreign languages in the future of a country, so it must be incorporated into education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as “international communication skills.”
In independent schools, the right to choice, diversity and excellence is still offered to children in Scotland.
It has to be done (in French).
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council.
LeBron will play for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego for the first time.
Expectations for fans who want to see LeBron James in the Los Angeles Lakers team for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play against Denver Nagtz in San Diego in the opening match of the season on Saturday.
The number of minutes to play is still unclear.
On Tim Lakers’ official website, Walton said: “It will be more than one and less than 48 minutes.
Lakers reporter Mike Truddle says James is likely to play for a limited time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked to pitch his plans for the first six games of the season.
He said: “I don’t need to play pre-season games at this point in my career.
Trump's election in West Virginia, youtube channel
President Trump will begin a series of electoral rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of five meetings planned by Trump next week, including stops in the areas of Tennessee and Mississippi that are politically in favor of Trump.
Trump, with a vote of approval to retain his electorate to fill the vacant seat of the Supreme Court, intends to win their support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress in November.
When is Trump’s election rally in West Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
Trump's election rally in Wheeling West Virginia is scheduled for ET tonight at 7:00 p.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's election rally in West Virginia online in the following section via YouTube live streaming.
Trump will likely mention this week’s hearing of the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who was tensed by allegations of sexual misconduct and postponed by a Senate confirmation vote for a week to conduct an FBI investigation.
But the main goal of the campaign is to help Republicans and strengthen them in the November elections.
So, according to Reuters, a spokesman for President Trump’s campaign said the five electoral rallies will be held next week with the goal of “energizing volunteers and supporters because Republicans want to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
A Trump campaign spokesperson, who did not want to be named, told Reuters: “Congress control is so important in the president’s agenda that he will travel as many states as possible because we are entering the busy season of campaigns.
According to West Virginia Metro News, the election rally scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania together and be covered by the Pittsburgh media."
Saturday will be the second time Trump has visited West Virginia, where he won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican West Virginia nominee for the Senate, Mr. Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
Simon Heather, a political expert at the University of West Virginia, said: “This is not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has been forced to come here to help him improve his position in the polls.”
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team shows determination to fight and keep hope alive to enter Sunday’s solo tournament
After three one-way seasons, the Saturday evening four-player golf game could be exactly what the Ryder Cup needs.
Motion pendulum swinging is a completely inventive sport concept, but players really believe in it, and in similar situations, it has never been more than that.
So where is the movement now?
Jordan Speith said: “They had six points and now they’re four, so I think we’re doing it with a little bit of movement.
Of course, Europe has an advantage, four points ahead and 12 more games ahead.
Yet Americans, as Spieth says, feel like they’re starting to move, and they have a lot of things to be proud of, especially on the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have been playing together all day and each boasting of getting three out of four points.
The moves from T to Green are excellent and serve as a model for others.
As his turn of play continued, the joyful cries grew louder, he was able to throw a vital leg into the hole and equalize the race at a score of four when he and Thomas were two points behind.
His pat, which won the match for them at 15, was accompanied by a similar cry, a kind of shout that told you he believed the American team would not be eliminated.
"You really have to work hard and worry about your own race," said Spitzeth.
That's all the players have left.
18 holes to do something wonderful.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
The strange but admirable European couple has scored four out of four possible points and presented the perfect job.
Moliwood was the only couple who not only did not shoot Boogie on Saturday evening, but also avoided Boogie on Saturday morning, Friday evening, and even Friday morning on Nine Square II.
This round and the way in which their energy is exchanged with this cheerful and energetic crowd clearly show that they are the players who can win on Sunday, and when the sun sets at Le Golf National, there will be no other famous player other than Fleetwood and Molinari to guarantee a possible European victory.
Preferably both at the same time in different cavities.
However, it is still too early to talk about the greatness of Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly finished Sergio Garcia, who was the morning four-time champion alongside Alex Noren.
A double bogey in the first nine squares threw Spaniard and Swede into a hole they could never get out of.
However, there is no one on Sunday to help you get out of your hole.
Watching four-player and four-ball matches is very attractive due to the interactions between the players, the advice they give and don’t give, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has performed better as a team and is entering the final day with a significant advantage, but this season of four-player games has shown that the U.S. team has the courage to fight, something that some people, especially Americans, have been skeptical about.
Europe has a 10-6 advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
After playing very well in the four-man and four-ball tournaments on Saturday, Europe was able to score 10-6 points ahead of the United States and have a good finish on the final day.
The extraordinary couple, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, managed to win two victories against Tiger Woods, who worked hard to inspire others, and have so far scored four points in Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn of the European team, who wanted to keep the cup they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, was able to beat one of the bad-throwing U.S. players in the morning four balls and score 3-1.
The U.S. team proved more resilient in the four-man tournament and won two matches, but they were unable to compensate for their backsliding.
Jim Furyk’s team needs eight out of 12 solo matches on Sunday to keep the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari doubled Mollywood after an exciting weekend, and are the second couple in the history of the Ryder Cup to score four points out of their first four matches.
After overcoming Woods and Patrick Reed in four-ball competitions, they won Bryson Dechambeau with a more decisive 4&5 hit.
Woods, who had barely won two matches on Saturday, occasionally demonstrated his skill and talent, but lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-man, four-ball, and seven consecutive matches.
Justin Rose took a break in the morning four-ball tournament and returned to his partner Henrik Stenson for a four-player tournament, where they won 1&2 over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - the world's first and third-place finishers.
However, the Europeans did not make their way on a pleasant day, accompanied by a pleasant breeze southwest of Paris.
The big winners, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, set a good example for Americans by scoring two points on Saturday.
They won a hard 1&2 win against Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain in the four balls, and later returned to the field, and in the four-man race, they lost the first two holes, winning 3&4 against Poulter and Rory McIlroy.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, there have only been two occasions where a team can offset four points of backwardness and enter individual matches, although Furyk’s team only needs equals to keep the Cup.
However, after a second run in two days, it seems that the counter-attack Sunday has been too difficult for them.
North Korea says there is “no way” without trust for unilateral disarmament
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions would further distrust the United States and that under such circumstances it would not be willing to surrender its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho told the WTO’s annual General Assembly last year that North Korea had taken “significant steps to show goodwill,” including stopping nuclear and missile tests, destroying the nuclear test site, and committing to not developing weapons and nuclear technology.
“However, we did not receive any appropriate response from the United States.”
“Without trust in the United States, there would be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, we would not act unilaterally or in principle against our disarmament.”
While Ri reiterates North Korea’s repeated grievances about Washington’s resistance to the “stage” approach to nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea will be rewarded with each step, his statement is noteworthy because, unlike in the past, Pyongyang does not completely deny the possibility of unilateral nuclear disarmament.
Ri points to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first official meeting between the current U.S. president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to try to “disarm the Korean Peninsula” and Trump promised to ensure North Korea’s security.
North Korea has sought an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on the approach of ‘nuclear disarmament first’, and by increasing the pressure on sanctions it intends to use coercion to achieve its goal, and even opposes ‘the declaration of an end to the war’,” Ri said.
Some foolish people think that sanctions can bring us to our knees, that’s a hoax.
“But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions is increasing our mistrust.”
Ri made no mention of the schedule for a second meeting between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. president had said at the United Nations a few days earlier.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings held between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae in the past five months, adding, “If the other side were on the issue of nuclear disarmament, instead of the United States, South Korea, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have been such a deadlock.”
However, Ri’s tone of speech was quite different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly last year that after Trump’s “bad president” called Kim a “missile man” who is committing suicide, it was inevitable that he would target U.S. soil with North Korean missiles.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage to move toward disarmament, but said there was still much work to be done and that sanctions would remain in place until North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame, stressing, “If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia have said the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that “the implementation of the Security Council’s sanctions must continue vigorously and with no shortfall until we make sure that the nuclear disarmament is fully, finalized and verified.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased North Korea’s sanctions in an effort to block funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, after which he said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare the ground for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn’t go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, but North Korea accused him of “gangster demands” just hours later.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to destroy a missile site as well as a nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim told him he was referring to “appropriate measures” to security guarantees that Trump had pledged in Singapore and that he planned to move toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a lesson on getting enough rest
This year, a new lesson at Harvard University, in an effort to combat the spread of Machu culture, asks all undergraduate students to sleep more.
A university professor found that most of the world’s best university students were unaware of the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an active specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, designed the course and believes that it is the first of its kind in the United States.
After a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning, he decided to set up this unit.
She told the Telegraph: “A girl came to me in the end and said, ‘Why was I told about this now, in my final year?’
He said no one had ever told me about the importance of sleep – which surprised me.”
This year’s module is in the curriculum for the first time, explaining to students how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance, as well as improving overall health.
Paul Barriera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University’s health services, said the university had decided to add the lesson to the curriculum after finding that students were seriously sleep deprived during the week.
This one-hour course includes a series of interactive activities.
In one section, there is an image of a dorm room where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes, and books, and information about the effects of caffeine, light, and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, as well as the importance of a timely sleep habit.
In another part, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase their risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then a map of the university campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily habits.
Professor Czeisler added: “We know that this lesson will not change students’ behavior immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know – just as you have a right to know the effects of smoking on health.”
He said the culture of pride in “living the night” still exists, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students show that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Making sure you get enough quality sleep should be a student’s “secret weapon” to deal with stress, fatigue, and anxiety — even preventing overweight, because lack of sleep puts the brain in a state of hunger that makes a person constantly feel hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student studying chemical and physical biology who attended one of the professor’s classes last year during his first year at Harvard, helped design the course for Professor Czeisler.
She said the lesson opened her eyes and inspired her to try to present it across campus.
He expressed hope and said that the next step would be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar curriculum before joining the competitive institute.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set a warning to determine when to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic devices and LED lighting systems that can take your circadian rhythm out of balance and lead to trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga Flowers Defeated Gerrard Fellows
Dolly Menga's battered team capitulated Steven Gerrard, causing the Blue Rangers team to lose in another out-of-home match at Livingston, with a 0-1 loss.
Ibrox wanted to record its first win after winning 1-4 at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt scored Gerrard’s second defeat in 18 games as a coach to keep their team with eight points of difference in the lead-up to Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored his goal seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the Rangers, with their little motivation, were never able to score as well as they needed to draw the game.
While the Rangers have now fallen to sixth place, Livingston has reached third place and is only behind Hibernia because of the flower difference.
One of the Rangers, Calum Spence, was injured by throwing an object that appeared to have been thrown from the end of the stadium and had to be treated for a head wound, which could be a problem.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team that brought Ayr past to the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, played with the same 11 Livevingston players who scored a Hearts score last week and should have been happy to see his ready team beat their opponents every time.
Rangers may have more possession of the ball, but Livingston made better use of the balls he held.
They had to reach the goal just two minutes after arriving when Menga sent the ball to Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor with his first deep pass, but the midfielder missed the big opportunity and sent the ball out with great distance.
A long-distance free kick by Keagan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halket, but his teammate Alan Lithgow was only able to send him far behind the gate.
The Rangers took control of the game, but in the case of their game in the final third, there seemed to be more to believe than hope.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed that a penalty should be announced in the last fifteen minutes when he met Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson did not pay attention to the Colombian player's requests and indicated by hand that he should go away.
The Rangers scored only two shots in the first half, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, suffered a slight blow to the head by Lassana Coulibaly and a slow blow by Ovie Ejaria.
While the 34-minute goal of Livingston may have been the opposite of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it.
Again, the Rangers couldn’t handle the Jacobs program.
Scott Arfield didn’t react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, and he cooled the ball down to Menga, and he also easily kicked the ball and opened the gate.
In between, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly and Ryan Kent, and this change showed an almost immediate effect when the striker was going to get the ball to Morelos, but Kelly came out of the gate with a beautiful gesture and prevented it from arriving.
But Livingston went on to deliver exactly the same beauty game that the spectators liked, and Lithgow and Halket repeled the long balls one after the other.
The Holt team could have increased their advantage in the final moments, but McGregor stood well against Jacobs before Lithgow hit his head against the ball sent from the corner.
The Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton claimed in the final moments that when he hit Jacobs, he had to be declared a penalty, but once again Thomson did not listen to him.
Yearbook: Inventor of Geiger Counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Anniversary: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago on this day and counting ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger Counter.
With Geiger’s countdown in the 1950 film The Coronado Bells, with the artists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, scientists who didn’t seem to be cowboys, Geiger’s countdown, which was until now one of the main foundations of science, became one of the foundations of public culture:
Man: “What is that?”
Rogers: "The Geiger Counter is used to track radioactive minerals such as uranium.
“When you put this phone on the meat, you can really hear the effects of atoms emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals.”
Evans: “Really, it’s going to blow up now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention named after him is still alive.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Train Immune System to See “Patient” Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Could Train the Immune System to See and Kill the “Patient” Cells
The vaccine trains the immune system to identify the patient’s cells as part of treatment
This involves extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them in the lab.
They can then “see” a protein that is common to many cancers and then re-injected.
The experimental vaccine showed promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman was treated with the vaccine, which trains her immune system to identify “patient” cells, and her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
This involves extracting immune cells from the patient, changing them in the lab so that they can "see" a common protein found in many cancers called HER2, and then injecting them again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
Professor Berzofsky explained that HER2 "causes the development of several types of cancers," including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from the patient’s body and “educating” them on how to target cancer cells has been successfully used in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West took on Trump by wearing a MAGA hat after his time at SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West came to the studio after he praised US President Donald Trump in his performance on Saturday Night Live and said he would be elected in 2020.
After performing the third song of that night, Ghost Town, in which he wore a hat with the motto “Make America Great,” made unrelated comments against the Democrats and emphasized his support for Trump.
“There have been a lot of times when I talk to white people and they say, ‘How do you like Trump, he’s racist?’
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I should have left the United States a long time ago.”
SNL began the program with a humorous performance by Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mimicked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault allegations brought up by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although this section was not released, the West's speech was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It’s not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West.
West also complained to the audience that he was having a hard time behind the scenes because of the hat he was wearing.
According to the Washington Examiner, he said, “They bullied me behind the scenes.
They said, “Don’t wear that hat.”
They bullied me!
And then they told me that you were in a stifling space.”
West continued, "Do you want to see the stifling atmosphere?" And then he said, "You should wear my Superman cloak, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?"
Try the love.”
Veriety reported that his remarks made the audience hush at least twice, and that the SNL broadcast staff seemed to be panicking, and someone there told them, “The whole studio is in deadly silence.”
West was brought to the show at the last minute as an alternative to American singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West surprised a lot of people by playing "I Love It" and dressing up like a Perrier bottle.
West supported TPUSA’s conservative group leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest people: Thank you for resisting MOB.”
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West "is showing what he really believes, and that's absolutely amazing."
“But I prefer not to support someone I think is adopting and spreading a mindset that I think is harmful to my community (by buying music or clothes or supporting ‘Art’).
He added, “He’s free.
We too.”
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now “a person formerly known as Kanye West.”
He wasn’t the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, known as Puff Daddy, Puff Daddy and P Diddy.
His colleague Snoop Dogg, a rapper, used to be called Snoop Lion, and of course the legendary musician, Prince, changed his name to a sign, and then became an artist known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder after stabbing at Belfast restaurant

The charges will be investigated by the Attorney General.
Kit Harington star of Game of Thrones has been criticized for toxic masculinity syndrome
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow, a skilled swordsman in HBO's violent, fantasy and medieval game of thrones series.
But the 31-year-old actor has been criticized for having Machu’s heroic stereotype, and it is said that displaying such roles often makes young boys feel like they need to be harsh and tough to be respected.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed “something went wrong” and was asked how to deal with toxic masculinity in the era of <0x23>MeToo.
Kit, who recently married her supporting role in the 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admits that she “feels completely powerless” about solving the problem.
He said, “I feel completely empowered right now personally – where did we go wrong about masculinity?”
“What have we taught men when they were growing up, in terms of the problem we’re seeing now?”
Kit believes that television, thanks to its highly masculine characters, may be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity.
He continued: “What is inherent and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel like they should have this particular aspect of being a man?
I think this is really one of the big questions in our era – how should we change this?
Because it’s clear that something is wrong with young men.”
In the interview, he also said that when Game of Thrones ends next summer, he has no plans to go ahead or continue the series, saying that “his work on the battlefield and the horses is over.”
In November, Kit remakes True West by Sam Shepard, which tells the story of a filmmaker and his brother, a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he thought the best outcome of Game of Thrones was to meet his wife Rose.
“I met my wife on this show, so it gave me my family and my future life from here on out,” she said.
In the Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose plays Ygritte, the mistress of Kit’s character Jon Snow.
The couple got married in June 2018 on the Leslie family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a 14% increase in new cases
China has declared a 14% mutation in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people in the country have the disease.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease is transmitted through sex, indicating a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province that the number of people infected with HIV had dropped to almost zero.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 per year.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was outlawed in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is very common.
Research has estimated that because of the country’s conservative values, 90–70 percent of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Many cases of transmission of the disease occur due to inadequate sexual protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to provide universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to combat the problem.
Maxine Waters denies involvement of his staff in GOP senators
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday dismissed claims that one of his staff posted personal information from three Republican senators on the legislators’ Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations were made by experts and websites of the far-right party.
In a statement on Twitter, Waters said: “Liars, lies and repeated lies.”
According to reports, the information included the home address and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham from Southern California and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah.
The information posted online on Thursday was sent by an anonymous person in Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on sexual misconduct allegations against the candidate of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The revelation came shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Hill reported that conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that specifies the source of these posts was linked to the Waters office and published information from a Waters employee.
Waters continued, “This baseless claim is completely false and absolutely false.”
“My employee — whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these false and fraudulent claims — has not been responsible for the disclosure of this information at all.
This unfounded claim is completely false and absolutely false.”
The Waters statement quickly sparked online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
Fleisher wrote: “This was a lie with anger.”
“This shows that he doesn’t have the morale to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven’t done, they shouldn’t be angry.
It shouldn’t cost too much.
Do not question the motives of the accused.
He must be calm and calm.”
Fleischer seemed to be comparing Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wanted to take the place of Waters in the midterm elections, said on Twitter.
He tweeted: “If it’s true, it’s a big claim.”
Waters said in a statement that his office had warned “relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies” of these fraudulent claims.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are identified and take legal responsibility for all the destructive and dangerous actions they have committed against one or all of my employees.”
Johnny English Strikes Again – Rowan Atkinson
It has become common to see signs of Brexit in every new movie that has a connection to the UK, and it seems to be the case with the new Johnny English action-comedy film, which began with Johnny English in 2003 and was revived with Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Will making a satirical film about how low we really are be a new export opportunity for people?
However, Johnny English, the big-eyed, rubber-faced, was able to get a license to release a new version for the second time — a comic character designed for non-English-speaking cinematic areas, more than anything else.
Of course, he’s a silly secret agent who, despite his strange pretense of verbal greed, has mixed a little bit of Detective Clouseau, Mr. Bean, and a little bit of the man’s character, into the theme of “Fire Chariots” at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
He is also originally based on Atkinson’s Traveller Man and Mysterious International, who once aired in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV ads and left after the chaos broke out.
In the latest version of the movie, there are only one or two beautiful scenes.
I liked the scene in which Johnny English, wearing a medieval armor, approached the helicopter and its blades briefly hit his hat.
Atkinson’s gift for the physical comedy is on the stage, but it feels like its humor is weak and ironically overrated, especially given that now “serious” films like 007 and their own “impossible mission” are confidently offering comedy as part of the film.
It feels like the humor of the film is more intended for children than for adults, and in my opinion, the Johnny English humor events are less innovative and focused than Atkinson’s stunts in his silent films as Bean.
This time, the film’s theme hypothesis is that Britain is in serious danger.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the top-secret network of British spies, revealing the identities of all British spies in fear of a serving spy – a regrettable little role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last blow for a prime minister, an important and under pressure figure, and has already lost its grip on political unpopularity: Emma Thompson delivers her best in the same role as Teresa-May, but there’s nothing more in the script to take advantage of.
His intelligence advisers tell him that since all active spies are at risk, he must re-enter one of the pensioners.
And that means Johnny English, who is now working as a teacher at a modern educational institution, is offering secret lessons on how to be a secret agent: there are a few beautiful stunts here and in the scenes where English is teaching at the Academy of Spy.
English is immediately returned to Whitehall and presents at a brief notification session, then joins his former colleague, Bough, who has had a lot of problems together, which is again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married and moved to a submarine commander, a top-class female role played by Vicki Pepperdine, but not quite as well.
So Batman and Robin, who made a terrible mistake on Her Majesty’s Secret Service, went back to the stage with Olga Kurylenko, who plays the beautiful woman Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously influenced by the tech billionaire who is a charismatic figure, he claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the negative role played by Jason Volta by Jack Lacy.
English and Bough Odyssey begin their satire: as waitresses, they lead to the fire of a luxurious French restaurant; they lead to a fight by hiding their smuggling in the luxury boat Volta and leaving the country; and English leads to a lot of chaos in an attempt to use the virtual reality headset to get to know the interior of the Volta home.
Sure, all efforts have been made for the last scene, but while it’s pleasant and action-packed, the effects of children’s special films can be seen throughout the film.
Something quite average.
And like all Johnny English films, I couldn’t find an answer to my question: Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really fits his talent?
The Labour Party has rejected the idea that it is designing a scheme that would allow the British to work four days a week but be paid as much as five days.
Labour's Jeremy Corbyn is planning an extreme plan that will force the British to work four days a week - but earn as much as five days.
According to reports, the party is asking corporate bosses to give employees one more day of paid leave by using the savings generated by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.
The plan will allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend – and still receive the same wages as before.
Sources say the idea is “appropriate” to the party’s economic plan, and the party is trying to move the country toward the interests of the workers.
The move toward a four-day working week has been endorsed by Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told Sunday Times: “A re-examination of policies is expected before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but the plan of the week has four working days, a demand that fits with the party’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of the worker, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first party to endorse such an idea, but the Green Party pledged in its 2017 campaign to implement a four-day working week plan.
However, this demand is not generally endorsed by the Labour Party at the moment.
A Labour spokesperson said: “The week has no four-day workdays and the Party has no plans for it.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to explain his views on a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he had decided to take back power in public services from “anonymous” and “user” executives.
The shadowy candidacy also means that shareholders of water companies can’t take all of their shares because the Labour government can deduct “deductions” from them based on violations they’ve committed.
He also confirmed that he plans to bring workers into the board of directors and create group-owned funds to transfer 10 percent of private-sector companies’ capital to employees, which means reaching a maximum annual dividend of <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, tells 60 Minutes whether FBI investigations into Kavanaugh have changed their minds
An FBI investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote for his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising the question of whether the FBI’s findings could force any Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview on Sunday, Scott Pellley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI’s findings could change their minds.
Kennedy appeared to be more explicit than his colleague from Southern California.
Kennedy said, “I think, of course.”
“As I said, I went to the courtroom, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened and the claim spread, and I said, "Did you do that?"
He was determined, determined and confident.”
Graham’s vote, however, seemed immutable.
“I have expressed my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and such accusations cannot change it,” he said.
Referring to Christine Blasey Ford, Graham added: “Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know this: Brett strongly rejected it.”
And anyone who mentions him can’t confirm the issue.
He is 36 years old.
I don’t see anything new to change my mind.”
What is the Global Citizenship Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World Citizenship Festival, an annual music event featuring a very famous band of stars and a very important mission: to end global poverty.
The World Citizenship Festival, now in its seventh year, has attracted tens of thousands of people to the Great Lawn Central Park to not only enjoy performances by artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the event’s main goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizenship Festival, which began in 2012, is one of the developed parts of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people active in the fight against poverty.
In order to receive free VIP tickets, people who want to attend the event (unless they are willing to pay for VIP tickets) must contribute by performing a series of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, emailing to a global leader, calling, or any other effective way to raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has global citizenship been, with 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to persuade them to make calls to ask for action or another type of so-called “clicktivism” – people who feel like they’ve done a great job by signing an online petition or posting a tweet.
Global citizenship says it has registered more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters since 2011, who have worked hard to achieve various goals.
These measures, they say, have helped drive global leaders and drive commitments and policies that cost more than $37 billion to make a positive impact on the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group noted 390 commitments and notifications stemming from their actions, of which at least $10 billion had already been paid or in the form of donations.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds so far have had a direct impact on about 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a group of UK-based investors and performers who, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets of global citizenship, have pledged to “help children grow and reach their full potential” and pledged to contribute $35 million to Rwanda to help eradicate malnutrition in the region.
In April 2018, Ambassador Tracey Ullman addressed the crowd during a live concert: “With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can eradicate malnutrition, which is a social injustice, and transplant it into history.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 requests from the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government said it would allocate funds for a project called Power of Nutrition, which would include food intervention for 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on his website, he asked, “What makes you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?”
He said: “It’s going to be a long and difficult journey – sometimes we’re going to fall and we’re not going to succeed.
But like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements that preceded us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York City hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. Can Use Naval Forces to Stop Russia’s Energy Exports
U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke said Washington could resort to naval force “if necessary” to prevent Russia’s energy supplies from reaching markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria — especially as it was conducted at the invitation of a legitimate government — was an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I believe the reason they’re in the Middle East is because they want to make a deal for their energy, just like they do in the eastern and southern part of Europe,” he said.
And according to this official, there are methods and tools to deal with it.
"The United States, using its navy, has the ability to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that their energy doesn't go to the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to attendees at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that calls itself the “energy consumer voice” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approaches to Russia and Iran and said they were practically identical.
While referring to Russia as a “single-product country” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels, he said, “The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to influence and replace fuels.”
The statements show that Trump’s policy is to increase liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and replace it with European gas, which is a cheaper but more distant option for European consumers.
To achieve this, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “unsuitable” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that Trump said would “slave” Berlin to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, designed to double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin says Washington’s strong opposition to the project is only for economic reasons and is an example of unhealthy competition.
Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak, after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September, said: “I think we share the view that energy should not be a tool for pressure, and consumers should be able to choose suppliers.
The U.S. position provoked a strong reaction from Germany and reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German industry leader, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has advised the United States to avoid interfering in EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
After a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Dieter Kempf said, “It is not indigestible for me to have a third state interfere in our energy supply.”
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “seriously” run for 2020 presidential election
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would “seriously” compete for the midterm election.
Warren confirmed at a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, that he was looking to take part in the competition.
According to The Hill, she said, “It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our faulty government, including putting a woman in charge.
“After November 6th, I will seriously seek to compete for the presidency.”
Warren said at a municipal meeting in opposition to Donald Trump that he was “stepping the region in the wrong direction.”
“I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy.”
Warren has so far been openly critical of Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “We need an FBI investigation before we can vote.”
However, a poll published Thursday found that most of Warren’s own constituency is reluctant to participate in the 2020 election.
A survey by the Suffolk/Boston Globe University’s Center for Political Research found that 58 percent of Massachusetts “probably” voters said the senator shouldn’t be running.
Thirty-two percent supported his campaign.
The poll found that people were more supportive of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% for his potential company and 48% against it.
Other prominent Democratic figures who raised the possibility of their participation in the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
The Associated Press reported that Biden said he would announce his decision by January.
Sarah Palin at Donald Trump's election rally mentions her son's PTSD track palin
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being enrolled in the military in September.
He was arrested on Monday night on charges of domestic violence.
His mother said at Donald Trump’s campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma: “What’s happening to my son, what’s happening to him after he comes back, I can name other families who feel the negative effects of PTSD and some of the damage our soldiers have done to them.
Palin spoke of his son’s arrest as “a big problem that everyone ignores,” and said of his son and other veterans, “they come back with a different attitude, they come back with a hard heart, they come back and ask if there’s that respect for what their soldiers and air force friends and any other member of the military have given to the country.”
According to Wasilla Police Department spokesman Dan Bennett, he was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, despite reports of domestic violence and having a gun while intoxicated.
18 states, as well as the D.C., support the challenge of a new refugee policy.
Eighteen states, along with the District of Columbia, support the creation of a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that prevents refugees from fleeing victims of criminal groups or domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 states and the department in Washington on Friday provided the court with brief advisory information that challenged asylum policy.
The full name of the plaintiff has not been released in the Grace v. Sessions petition filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August.
He said his fiancée had abused him along with his "friend's sons who are members of a violent gang," but U.S. officials rejected his request for asylum on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
The government’s lawyer, who supported Grace, explained that El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, where so many asylum applications are being sent to the United States, are countries that are increasingly facing problems related to gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. refugee policy reversed the order, allowing illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District Attorney General of Colombia, Karl Racine, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "passes dozens of state, federal and international laws."
In his brief advisory information, he said, “All asylum applications must be investigated according to federal law on the basis of the exact facts and circumstances of the application, and such an exception violates this principle.”
The lawyers also argued in the consultative information provided that given that there is a high probability of immigrants becoming entrepreneurs and “supplying the necessary workforce,” and concluded that the policy, which prevents immigrants from entering the U.S. economy, would be detrimental to the U.S. economy.
In June, General Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered that immigration judges no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
Sessions said in a June 11 statement on the policy: “Refugee is available to those who have left their country due to torture or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of certain social groups or political views.
Asylum has never meant solving all the problems -- even all the serious ones -- that people around the world face on a daily basis.
Despite doubling the death toll, efforts are underway to find survivors in Palu.
The conditions for the survivors were increasingly dire.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said while caressing her feverish boy’s body at an evacuation center in the damaged city of Palu, “I feel terrible.”
“An ambulance brings the bodies.
Clean water is scarce.”
Residents are seen returning to their destroyed homes, wandering among their belongings drowned in the water and trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals have been damaged and destroyed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Harris, whose shoulder and back were fractured, rested outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated for strong aftershocks.
When she recounted her feelings about the strong earthquake that shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where she, her husband and daughter were present, tears were pouring down her eyes.
Haris told the Associated Press: “We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I think I was thrown into the ruins of the wall,” he added, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife crying and asking for help, but then her voice became silent.
I don’t know what happened to him and my son.
I hope they are in a safe place.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "aggression" with propaganda
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper about the bilateral benefits of the China-U.S. agreement, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to disseminate propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 U.S. congressional election, which China rejected, pointed to China Daily's monetary annexation of the Des Moines Register, the state's most-selling newspaper.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in the U.S. election showed what U.S. officials told Reuters was the beginning of a new phase of escalating pressure on China by Washington.
While ordering commercials is commonplace for foreign governments, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a growing trade war that has led to tariffs on each other’s goods.
Chinese and U.S. experts said China’s retaliatory tariffs in the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Lowa, which backed Trump’s Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China, who has long been governor of Lowa and one of the major exporters of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
In an article published in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote: “China continues to bully by publishing propaganda in our free press.”
Branstad wrote, “The Chinese government is using the popular tradition of free speech and free press in the United States to its advantage by publishing paid propaganda in the Des Moines Register.”
“Instead, you see that there are limited opposition voices in the newspaper stand here on Beijing Street, and you see no real reflection of the opposition views that people may have about China’s worrisome economic trajectory, because the media is under the strict control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most prominent newspapers has refused to accept his proposal to publish his paper,” although he did not say which newspaper he meant.
Analysts warn that Republicans with the Kavanaugh scandal are evading female voters from midterm elections.
Analysts have warned that as many Republicans defend the candidate of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in the face of several rape allegations, and insist on his election, it will lead to a counter-reaction, especially from women in the upcoming midterm elections.
There is a lot of sentiment around this, and most Republicans have shown, based on records, that they want to advance with a vote.
Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, told The Hill in an article published on Saturday that “things can’t be reversed.”
Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)’s recent support for FBI investigations would be enough to calm angry voters.
According to the Washington, D.C., Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for MoveOn, said: “Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow or November.”
Despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Republicans are in control of the Judiciary Committee elected to handle Kavanaugh’s nomination, demonstrators protesting in the Senate hallway on Friday morning, shouting “November is coming!”
Stu Rothenberg, a neutral analyst, told the news site: “Democrats’ enthusiasm is growing tremendously.”
“People say this passion has already been high, that’s right.
But it can go even higher, especially among women who are skeptical, as well as young people aged 18 to 29 who often don’t vote, even though they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she detailed her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had stated that there would be a counter-reaction if Republicans backed her endorsement.
According to NBC News, Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week that “this has become a complex problem for the GOP.”
Guy Cecil, director of the United States Privileges, a group that helps Democrats win the election, told the news channel: “It’s not just the vote of the committee or the final vote or that Kavanaugh will be tried, it’s the way Republicans have managed the issue and how they treat him.”
After all, Americans appear to be hesitant after testimony by Ford and Kavanaugh on who to believe, although the latter seems to be a bit more popular.
A new survey conducted by YouGov found that 41% of respondents believed Ford’s testimony definitely or probably, while 35% said they believed Kavanaugh’s.
In addition, 38 percent said they think Kavanaugh lied, or probably lied, in his testimony, while only 30 percent said they believed about Ford.
The Guardian reported that after announcing Flake’s support, the FBI is investigating allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other defendant, Deborah Ramirez.
Ford took an oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, testifying that Kavanaugh raped him drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee, while attending a party together while studying at Yale in the 1980s, showed him his genitals.
World Wide Web Inventor Plans to Launch New Internet to Compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend is Inrupt, a company based on the open-source erners-Lee platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are authorized to access it.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the idea behind Inrupt was “global dominance.”
He said about the startup, “We need to do this now.”
“This is a historic moment.”
The program uses solid technology to allow individuals to create their own “online storage of personal information,” or POD.
This space can include audience lists, to-do lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in the same browser at the same time.
What makes this online storage of personal information unique is that it’s entirely up to the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through information.”
According to John Bruce’s CEO, the idea of Inrupt is to provide the company with the right resources, processes, and skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company is currently comprised of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, several developers contracted to work on the project, and a series of volunteer programmers.
As of this week, technology developers from all over the world can create their own decentralized applications using tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team did not talk to Facebook and Google about making or not making a complete change that would turn all their business models upside down overnight.
“We don’t ask permission from them.”
Berners-Lee wrote in a post on Saturday that “the mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.”
Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been an influential figure in the net neutrality debate in recent months.
Berners-Lee will remain open even with the launch of Inrupt, the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Information Institute.
Berners-Lee added: “I’m incredibly optimistic about the next web era.
Bernard Vann was honored as the recipient of the Victorian Cross during World War I.
The only English priest to receive the Victorian Cross as a warrior in World War I was honored in his hometown on the centennial anniversary of the award.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann received the award on September 29, 1918, in the attack on Belenglise and Lehoucourt.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper and never learned that he had received the highest military honor in England.
On Saturday, a memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s masterpiece, which earned him the honor, his memorial stone was “smart and symbolic.”
According to a report by London Gazette on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion at the Canal de Saint-Quentin, “during a thick fog under heavy fire of cannon and guns.”
He later raided the line of fire and, with “full courage” alone and before the cannon attack, led the line forward and crushed the three groups.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I could never have been as good as, but it’s small.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, placed a flower crown on the ground in his memory after the parade, led by the Brentwood Royal Youth Group.
Michael Vann said he was “very proud to have played a part in the parade,” adding that “the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support provided by so many people.”
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but Peppa Pig was replaced.
Imagine you’ve been up all night watching a Bellator 206 just so you don’t watch the main event.
San Jose’s bill included 13 fights, including six on the original card that aired live throughout the night on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Moussasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, the television coverage was cut off, and Peppa Pig’s cartoon was aired, astounding and annoyed.
Some of them felt bad after staying awake until the early hours of the morning to watch the fight.
A Twitter fan called the change to children’s cartoon “a sick joke.”
Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications at Bellator, said: “It’s a government regulation that at 6 a.m. this content is not appropriate, so they had to switch to children’s cartoons.”
“Peppa Pig,” yes.
Bellator’s chairman, Scott Coker, said they plan to work on their planning so they can cover UK viewers in the future.
Coker said, “When I think about replay, I think we can think about it.”
But in that case, it was 6 a.m. on Sunday, and we can’t think about it until Sunday in our time and Monday in their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when this program was changed, a lot of messages were exchanged and those messages were not friendly.
We were trying to fix the problem, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn’t, it was a government problem.
I can promise you this won’t happen in the future.
"We're going to reduce the number of fights from six to five - like we usually do - this time we tried to provide additional services to the fans, and we just tried.
This is a sad situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels “Degraded” for Sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling humiliated by everyone because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he was in high school that “everyone looks like me.”
While on the first broadcast of Radio 4 Desert Island Discs by Lauren Laverne, she said she spoke openly about gay rights to give “hope” to others.
He also said that becoming a father has made him no longer care about winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the main presenter of the old program, has taken several months off due to illness.
Daley, who attended the first Laverne show as an outcast, said she felt “humiliated” with everyone else because “socially, it was unacceptable to love boys and girls.”
“Until now, this feeling of humiliation and difference have been the real things that have given me the power and the ability to succeed.”
She said she wanted to prove that she was “important,” so that when others learned about her sexuality, she didn’t disappoint them.
He, who has won the Olympic bronze medal twice, has become a prominent LGBT campaign fighter, using his presence at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia and calling on more countries to legalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke openly because he felt lucky to be able to live openly and without negative consequences and wanted to “give hope” to others.
Three-time world champion, she said she fell in love with a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black who met her in 2013 – “surprised me.”
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but said the age gap has never been a problem.
“When you’re so advanced at such a young age” — at 14 years old, she went to the Olympics for the first time and her father died of cancer three years later — she said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple had a baby boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said his “global vision” had changed.
“If you had asked me the year before, all I could do was win the gold medal,” he said.
“You know, there are bigger things than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son, Robert, died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said her father had refused to accept that she was dying, and one of the last things she asked was whether she still had tickets for the 2012 Olympics – because she wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him that you weren’t supposed to be there to be in the front row, Dad.”
He said: “When he stopped breathing, I held his hand in his hand, and when he really stopped breathing and died, I finally realized he was not invincible.”
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I knew this was what I had been dreaming about my whole life – to dive in front of a crowd of people from my own country at the Olympics, there was no better feeling than that,” he said.
It also inspired her to make her first song choice – Proud by Heather Small – which she accompanied on her journey to the Olympics, and is still very fond of.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson unprepared to sit on the bench on Saturday at the Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a new record in the 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but will come on form to prevent it from turning into an unpleasant milestone.
Mickelson, who takes part in the two-year event for the 12th time, was spotted on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the four-ball and four-player games on Saturday.
The big player, who has a history of winning five times, instead of being in the center of the game as he often did for the United States, spent his day as a spectators leader and trying to improve his game on the ball in the hopes of correcting his problems.
The 48-year-old, who has never been one of the best strikers in his career, is not a good choice for the tough Le Golf Nationals, which are usually shots with a long lawn slope around the golf course.
And if it’s not intimidating enough on its own, Mickelson faces the exact champion of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, in a team with Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If Americans who are four points behind despite starting 12 solo races have a good start, Mickelson’s race can be crucial and decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his players, but he couldn’t say anything else.
Furyk said, “He totally understood the role he had played yesterday, he admired me, threw his hand around me and said he would be ready tomorrow.”
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He has won a lot of honors and this week, these teams have learned a lot from him.
I probably didn’t think he would play in two matches.
I thought it was more than that, but that’s how it went, and I think we should accept that.
He wants to be on the field like everyone else.”
Mikelson will break Nick Faldo’s record for the highest number of Ryder Cup appearances on Sunday.
This could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that could never be as good as his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk said his presence is an intangible asset for the team.
He said: “It’s fun, it’s fun, it’s fun, it’s fun, it’s fun, it’s fun, it’s fun.
"I think the younger players are having fun criticizing him, including this week that was spectacular.
Besides the game, he brings us a lot of other things.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that their decisive supremacy could soon be wiped out.
According to his experience, European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that stepping into the final day of a solo match at the Ryder Cup with a significant advantage can easily turn into an unpleasant ending.
The Danish golfer began his career in the 1997 tournament at Valderrama, where a team captained the Seve Ballesteros five points ahead of the Americans but won in the end with a close result of 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>214-1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>213.
After watching the 2018 3-5 wins on Friday and yesterday leading to a 6-10 victory at Le Golf National, Bjorn said: “Remember that we had a decisive advantage at Valderrama, we had a decisive advantage at Brookline and we lost and we won at Valderrama, but we were a bit far from losing.”
So history has shown me and all the people on that team that the game is not over.
Tomorrow you must go to the field with all your might.
Go there and do the right thing.
As long as the scores are not on the board, the game is not over.
We have a goal and our goal is to try to win the Cup and your focus should be on that goal.
I’ve always said I’m focused on the 12 players who are on our team, but we’re fully aware of the team that’s in front of us – the biggest players in the world.”
Bjorn is pleased with the performance of his players in this tough golf competition, adding: “I never judge this too early.
Tomorrow will be a completely different day.
Tomorrow is a solitary day, and it's a different thing to do.
When things go well, it's great to be on the field with a teammate, but when you're on the field alone, your abilities as a golfer are fully tested.
This is the message you have to convey to the players, deliver your best performance tomorrow.
Now, you leave your teammate and he has to go and try to do his best.
In contrast to Bjorn, Captain Jim Furyk will seek to make his players more individual than team performance, with the exception of Jordan Speith and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furyk himself has experienced both of these big changes of the last day, he was part of the winning team at Brookline before Europe managed to perform a “miracle at Medinah” and make him finish the game as a loser.
Asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw prepared his players for the final day, he said, “I remember all the damn words of that day.”
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you’d like that quick start that you’ve seen on Brooklyn, similar to what you’ve seen on Medina.
When the force moves in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on those who are in the race.
We will determine our composition based on this, and we will defeat their companions as we like, you know, tomorrow we will try to do miracles.”
The task of trying to lead the fight is assigned to Thomas and confronts Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, and other Europeans in the upper half of the mix, in the Premier League match against Rory McIlroy.
Speaking about his individual choices, Bjorn said: “I put this group of people in this way because I think it covers all sectors.
Germany’s new warship has been delayed again.
Germany's newest navy was due to be completed in 2014 to replace the old Cold War navy, but will not be ready until at least next year due to system defects and high costs.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, a military spokesperson, the completion of the mission of the original Rheinland-Pfalz ship from the Baden-Württemberg class is delayed until the first half of 2019.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but troublesome problems after delivery have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class ships.
It is clear that the ships will use a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as several radar-detection technologies such as radar, infrared and acoustic reduction.
Other important features include a longer period of retention - it will likely be possible to deploy new carriers for a maximum of two years away from home shores.
However, continued delays mean that these modern carriers - which are said to allow Germany to increase its power in overseas waters - will be outdated until it enters the Navy.
Last year, when the German navy officially refused to deploy the failed F125 and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg, it caused a lot of noise in the media.
This was the first time the Navy had sent a ship back to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media have said there were a number of "software and hardware" flaws that would have used the ship if it was used for a combat mission.
Software flaws are particularly important because the Baden-Württemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors - only half the manpower of the older Bremen-class ships.
It was also found that the ship was significantly heavier than standard, which would reduce its performance and limit the Navy’s ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is thought to be twice as heavy as the same class ships used by Germany in World War II.
Aside from hardware deficiencies, the total cost of the project – including crew training – is also becoming a staple.
The cost is said to have reached a staggering figure of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – from the initial cost of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems that the new carriers face are of particular importance given the warnings that the German navy is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the House Defense Committee, acknowledged that the Navy was “really running out of deployable ships.”
The official said the problem has increased over time, as old ships have been withdrawn from the mission, but alternative ships have not been provided.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships had been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust is investigating the secret lives of bats.
New research is underway in part of the Scottish Highlands to determine how bats use the area to hunt for food.
It is hoped that the findings will reveal new insights into the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
The research, conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, tracks short-legged bats and dwarf bats, as well as long-eared bats and bats in the Inverewe gardens at Wester Ross.
Special registers will be placed in key locations around the area to track bat activity during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile mapping using handheld detectors.
Specialized analysis will determine the sound of all recorded cases, the frequency of bat sounds, as well as what each species does.
A map and report of their habitat will then be created to provide a detailed picture of their behavior on a regional scale.
Rob Dewar, a natural conservation adviser for NTS, expressed hope that the results of the study will determine which habitat areas are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of practices related to habitat management, including the creation of grasslands and how forests are best preserved for bats and other related species.
Over the past century, bat populations in Scotland and throughout the UK have declined significantly.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects their nests and destroys their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also be hazardous, as well as insecticide paper and some chemical compounds of building materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
Bats are not really blind.
However, due to the habit of night hunting, when it comes to prey hunting, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use a sophisticated echoing technique to pinpoint the exact location of insects and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the subject of bats very seriously.
They have ten trained specialists who regularly conduct surveys, surveys of nests, and sometimes rescues.
The organization even designated the Threave lands in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species, as the first and only protected area for bats in Scotland.
David Thompson, director of the district, says the area is an ideal territory for them.
“Here in Treave, we have a very good area for bats.”
“We have old buildings, many old trees and all the right habitats.
“But there’s a lot about bats that’s still unknown, so what we’re doing here and elsewhere will help us figure out what else they need to grow.”
He emphasized the importance of investigating the presence of bats before repairing the buildings because the unintentional destruction of a mother bat's nest could result in the killing of up to 400 female and young bats, which would likely result in the destruction of an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass and harass them and destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish director of the Bat Conservation Trust, urged people to seriously help.
“We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we still don’t know how their populations survive,” he said.
Ronaldo denies rape allegations and lawyers are prosecuting complaints from German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations against him “fake news” and said people “wanted to make themselves famous by using his name.”
His lawyers are seeking a complaint with the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which has published the claims.
The Portuguese and Juventus attackers have been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he allegedly paid the woman $375,000 to keep her quiet about the incident.
The 33-year-old Ronaldo, who spoke to 142 million Instagram followers hours after reporting the allegations, denies the allegations, calling them “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
The five-time winner of the Ballon d’Or said to the camera: “What they said today was fake news.”
“They want to make themselves famous by using my name.
It's natural.
They want to be famous by calling my name, but that’s part of my job.”
With a smile, he added, “I’m a happy person and everything is going well.”
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel about the allegations, which he called “invalid reports of unproven privacy information.”
Christian Schertz’s lawyer said the player was seeking compensation for “mental injuries to a degree proportionate to the attractiveness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of individual rights in recent years.”
The alleged event is said to have taken place in June 2009 in the Swiss hotel and casino Palms in Las Vegas.
According to the district court documents, Clark, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player’s room after meeting at a nightclub, claiming that Ronaldo had raped him from the anus.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees and told him he was “99 percent good” and “one percent bad.”
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed the two had had sex, but said the relationship was consenting.
Mayorga also claimed to have gone to the police and taken pictures of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed outside the courtroom because she felt “fear of retaliation” and was concerned about “public humiliation.”
The 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to disrupt the agreement because of the continuing trauma of the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged assault, Ronaldo was on the verge of leaving Manchester United and joining Real Madrid, joining the Italian Juventus team this summer in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: Losing automakers will be a “permanent regret” for the UK
UK Trade Minister Greg Clark has said that if the UK loses its position as a global leader in automobile manufacturing after Brexit, it will "deal with their permanent regrets".
"It's worrying" that Toyota's UK unit told the BBC it would temporarily suspend production at the Burnaston plant near Derby if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.
Mr Clark said, “We need a deal.”
The Japanese automaker said that the impact of border delays on a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Auris and Toyota Avensis, produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other EU countries.
In a statement, Toyota CEO Marvin Cooke said: “My view is that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal at the end of March, we will see a halt in production at our factory.”
Other UK automakers, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed concern about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will operate.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern about what automakers say is related to the risks of the supply chain in the event of an exit without an agreement.
The Toyota product line operates on the principle of “right on time,” with parts coming to the factory every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers to make the cars on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, it could disrupt borders, which industries say could lead to delays and shortages.
Toyota said it would be impossible for us to maintain inventory at the Derbyshire plant for more than a day, and therefore production would be halted.
Clark said Ms. Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was “precisely designed to prevent these problems at the border.”
“We need to have a deal. We want the best deal to allow us, as I say, not only to succeed right now, but to take advantage of this opportunity.”
“What’s been raised not only by Toyota but also by other manufacturers is that we should be able to fully continue to use this successful supply chain.”
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but warned that in the long run these additional costs could reduce the factory’s competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is responsible for calling the Union Unite, said: “Based on my experience, once these jobs are gone, they will never be revived.
A government spokesman said: “We need to come up with a precise and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again
The White House said on Sunday that the ongoing controversy over the candidate of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, Donald Trump’s high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed for another week.”
Rosenstein oversees the performance of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's interference in the election and the relationship between Russia and Trump's aid and the president's possible obstruction of justice.
Whether or not Trump fires the deputy attorney general and thus jeopardizes Mueller’s independence has sparked rumours in Washington in recent months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein raised the issue of having a microphone to record his conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But he went to the White House on Monday despite reports of his resignation.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the UN at the time in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he "prefers" not to fire Rosenstein, but the hearing was postponed to prevent it from interfering with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, in which Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for another week, prompting further delays in the court’s ruling.
Sarah Sanders, Trump’s press assistant, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein’s meeting, he replied: “There is no date set for this, it could be this week, given other issues at the Supreme Court, it could be delayed another week.
But let’s see what happens and I always love to give the latest news to the press.
Some reporters disagree: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace, the show’s host, asked why.
Sanders said the lack of information provided about the meetings was not due to a lack of interest in “attracting attention” from television reporters, although he said he was “not opposed to the fact that they are seeking media attention.”
He then offered to increase Trump’s direct contact with the press.
“The president is holding more question-and-answer meetings than the presidents of the past,” he said without mentioning the evidence, adding: “We’ve looked at those numbers.”
The summary of the meeting will continue to be presented, but if the press has the opportunity to speak directly to the president.
“We’re trying to hold meetings like this more often, and you’ve seen a lot of meetings like this over the past few weeks, and when you can talk to the president of the United States, it’s going to take the place of the press.”
Trump answers questions while leaving the White House or attending open meetings or press conferences with high-ranking officials.
Press conferences are rarely held.
This week in New York, the president may have revealed the reason, and he appeared in front of a crowd of reporters, openly and strangely.
The Minister of Health writes a letter to EU employees at the Scottish National Health Organization (NHS) about concerns over Brexit.
In a letter to employees of the European Union at the Scottish National Health Organization, the Minister of Health expressed his appreciation for Scotland and wished them a stay in post-Brexit.
Member of the Scottish Parliament Jean Freeman wrote a letter stating that there are less than six months left before Britain leaves the European Union.
The Scottish government has pledged to pay for the application fees for finalized statuses for EU citizens working in weakened public service organizations.
Freeman wrote: “During the summer, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom are moving towards the anticipated decisions that will be made in the fall.
But the UK government is also increasing its readiness for a no-deal scenario.
I know this should be a very sad time for you.
That’s why I wanted to emphasize how much I now value every single member, regardless of their nationality.
Our partners across the EU and even outside the EU bring with them valuable experiences and skills that will strengthen and improve the healthcare sector and benefit patients and the communities I serve.
“Scotland is definitely your home, and we would like you to stay here.”
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after injury to his head
According to the report by Mike Organ of Tennessee, Christian Abercrombie, the backer of the Tennessee State Tigers team, underwent emergency surgery on Saturday after a head injury in a 31-27 defeat against Vanderbilt Commodore.
Tennesse State coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred a few minutes before halftime.
Reed said, “He came to the side of the line, and then he fell to the ground.”
Instructors and medical personnel gave him oxygen on the side line before placing an acromegaly on the tray and transporting him for further examination.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV network in Nashville, Tennessee that a surgery at Wenderbilt Medical Center had been completed.
Harris added: “There are no details yet on the type and extent of the injury, and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Aubrey, a second-year athlete, is spending his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five full tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his season to 18.
Foreign buyers incur higher costs when buying property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers of real estate in the United Kingdom will suffer higher costs, and additional costs will be used to help homeless people covered by the new grid schemes.
This move will thwart the success of the Corbyn plan to attract young voters.
An increase in the price of tax stamps will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury Department expects the amount to rise to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million annually to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers are set to pay more tax stamps when buying property in the United Kingdom – and the surplus will be paid to help the homeless, a news release that Theresa May will announce today.
The move is an attempt to thwart Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters by promising cheaper housing and targeting higher-income people.
The increase in tax stamps will apply to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes, and the surplus will help the government move to combat the sleep carton problem.
The surcharge – which is an addition to the current tax stamp fee and includes the higher tax amounts announced two years ago on second homes and purchased and then leased homes – will be as much as three percent.
The Treasury Department predicts the move will generate up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
Approximately 13% of London's new homes are purchased by residents outside the United Kingdom, which increases prices and makes it harder for first-time homebuyers to buy.
Many of the country’s richest areas – especially in the capital – have become “the ghost city” due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy began just weeks after Boris Johnson spoke of cutting tax stamps to help young people become landlords.
He accused large construction companies of keeping real estate prices high because of land ownership and unused land, and asked Ms. May to abandon quotas for cheaper homes in order to set up a “failure of housing” in the UK.
Mr. Carbine has made a series of interesting proposals for housing reform, including controlling rent and ending evacuation without committing an error.
He also wants to give city councils more authority to build new homes.
“Last year I said that I would give the prime minister priority to bring back the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means solving the dysfunctional housing market problem.
The UK’s doors are always open to those who want to build a new life here.
However, it is not true that buying a home is as easy for people who do not live here or for foreign companies as the UK’s hard-working residents.
For many people, the dream of being a landlord is very unlikely, and the shame of sleeping cardboard is a very bitter reality.”
Jack Ross: “My ultimate ambition is the management of Scotland”
Sunderland president Jack Ross says his “highest ambition” is to become the future CEO of Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scott enjoys the revival of the North-East club, which currently tops the league with three points.
After redirecting Saint Mirren to the Premier League last season, he moved to the Lighting Stadium this summer.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.”
Ross told BBC Sports Radio, “I got grade B, that’s all.”
“But I grew up with my dad when I was a kid watching Scotland at Hampden, and that’s something that always fascinates me.
However, this opportunity comes only when I’m successful in managing the club.”
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland executives include Dick Educott, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kane, Gus Poyet, and Paolo de Canino.
The former club president, Alva Atletic, said he had no fear of such reputable names, and had previously rejected Barsley and Ipswich's offer.
“The measure of success for me right now is ‘Can I bring this team back to the Premier League?’”
He said that because of the structure and the facilities of the club, it belongs to the Premier League."
“It’s not easy to get to the Premier League, but if I can get the team back, I think I’m going to be successful.”
After serving as assistant chief of staff at Dumbarton and 15 months of Hart coaching, Ross has only been in management for three years.
He then stopped Alva’s team from falling, bringing them back to third place, and next season turned Saint-Marin from a team on the verge of falling to the winner of the title.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he did when he played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and the Hamilton Academy.
Assuming responsibility for Alvaro’s team, he said it was “perhaps a real milestone.”
I definitely believed it was the right management for me, a lot more than just playing.
This seems strange because I was good, I made a good life out of it, and I enjoyed a reasonable social standing.
But playing can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you need to do during the week.
I’m still struggling with stress and work pressure, but I feel like I’m the right manager.
I’ve always wanted to manage, and now I do, it’s the best feeling I’ve ever felt in my adult life.”

Research shows that the perfect time to have a glass of beer is Saturday 5.30 p.m.
The summer heat wave has boosted sales in Britain’s struggling pubs, but has put a lot of pressure on the chain’s restaurants.
Pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, while restaurant sales fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA trade adviser, said: “Continuous sunshine and longer engagement than the UK expected at the World Cup means that July will follow a similar pattern to the month before June, when pubs have a 2.8% increase in sales.
A 1.8 percent drop in restaurant sales in June worsened in July.
Pubs that served drinks and bars performed better than their counterparts in most restaurants that saw sales drop.
The pubs that serve food also suffered from heat, but not as much as the restaurants.
People seem to just go out to drink.
Among pubs and bars, sales of drinks increased by 6.6% this month, and food sales fell by 3%.
Paul Newman, RSM’s welfare and hospitality analyst, said: “These results show a continuation of the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales outside the home market, the weather and the impact of major sporting and social events are the most important factors.
Unsurprisingly, the restaurant group is still struggling, though a 4.8 percent drop in sales each year will be much more painful, given the continued rise in spending pressures.
“This long, warm summer couldn’t have come at a worse time for food stores, and the time will tell whether the cooler weather we experienced in August will provide the much-needed deadline for these jobs.”
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, plus the newly established ones, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a decline in the supply of new products to the market by major brands.

One in five children has hidden social media accounts that their parents don't know about.
Research shows that one in five children — some of whom are just 11 years old — have hidden accounts on social media that parents and teachers don’t know about.
A study of 20,000 middle school students showed the growth of “fake Instagram pages.”
The news raises concerns about the spread of sexual content on these accounts.
Twenty percent of students said they had a “main” account to show their parents.
One in five children — some even up to the age of 11 — build social media accounts that keep them secret from adults.
In a study of 20,000 middle school students, it revealed rapid growth in “Insta Fake Accounts” – a referral to an Instagram photo sharing site.
The news raises concerns about the spread of sexual content on these accounts.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean “main” account to show their parents, while they also had other hidden accounts.
A mother who accidentally discovered the hidden site of her 13-year-old daughter noticed an adolescent girl asking her to “rape me.”
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors of Independent Schools (MHC) found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having concealed sex.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: “It’s so sad that many teens are tempted to create online spaces that parents and teachers can’t find.
Elyse Doyle will be the “voice of the athletes” on the Scottish sports board.
Elyde Doyle was elected as the non-executive director of the Scottish Sports Board at the current government's annual General Assembly.
Doyle is Scotland’s most prominent athlete in athletics, and Len Beatty, chairman of the board, saw the move as an opportunity for sports pioneers to benefit from his extensive experience at the international level over the past decade.
He said: “Ilyde enjoys great respect throughout Scotland, the United Kingdom and the international sports community, and we are confident that he will benefit greatly by bringing him to the board of directors of athletes in Scotland.”
Doyle said: “I’m looking forward to playing as the voice of the athletes and hopefully I can contribute and lead the Scottish sport.
The American athlete, who won four Olympic gold medals at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996 and is now a BBC permanent expert, lost his ability to walk after a temporary ischemia.
He tweeted: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said only time can tell if I can improve and how much I will improve.
It was really excruciating, but I recovered completely, learned how to walk again, and I’m doing a quick workout today!
Thank you for your messages of encouragement!”
Advertisements about breast pumps by comparing mothers to cows have created a divide in online reviews.
A breast pump company has created a division in online reviews by promoting comparisons of breastfeeding mothers with cows that are milked.
Consumer technology company Elvie has released a funny music video to inspire advertising to showcase the freedom that the new pump gives breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of cows’ straw with the following lyrics: “Yes, I breastfeed myself, but you don’t see any tails” and “If you don’t notice, these are not cow’s breasts, these are my breasts.”
“Run, run, run...I breastfeed the babies, run, run...I suck the milk of the women.”
However, the ad, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, has sparked controversy in the cyberspace.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received a variety of reactions from viewers, many of whom said the video was joking about the “horror” of the dairy industry.
“Using cows to promote this product is a poor decision.
Someone wrote, “Like us, they should get pregnant and give birth so they can produce milk, except that their babies are stolen a few days later.”
Elvie’s chest pump is secretly fitted into the nurse/mother’s bra (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else commented: “Comprehensibly heartbreaking for the mother and the baby.
But why shouldn’t we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?”
Someone else added, “What an incomprehensible advertisement.”
Some supported the ad, such as a woman who claimed that the song was “happy.”
“I think it’s a bad idea.
If I had to breastfeed my baby again, I would have wanted one.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
It was a little silly, but I accepted it as what it was.
Someone wrote, “This is a smart product.”
Someone else commented: “This is an interesting ad and it’s aimed at mothers who pump their milk (often at work or in the bathroom) and make them feel like cows.
This is not an ad for acknowledging or judging the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they all danced with hidden pumps in their breasts.
The concept behind this ad is based on the insight that most women who pump their milk say it makes them feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, without wires or tubes, and is hidden inside the bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold babies, and even go out while pumping.
Anna Balarin, a co-author and child development psychologist at the mother’s organization, said: “Elvie’s pump is like a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and controversial introduction.
By illustrating the similarity between lactating women and cows, we wanted to put the breast pumps and all their challenges under the lens, and at the same time show in a fun and understandable way the freedom these pumps will bring.
This isn’t the first time that Elvie’s pump has been headlined.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the fashion scene while using the product for fashion designer Martha Jacobovsky.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly taken to a tent camp on the Texas border.
While the number of illegally crossing the border has been relatively stable, the number of children detained has risen sharply, in part because of the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric and policies that have made it harder to find support for children.
Previously, most of their supporters were immigrants without legal documents, so they fear that they could be compromised by taking steps to protect their children’s stay in the country.
When federal officials announced that potential supporters and their families’ adults should give fingerprints, and the information is shared with immigration authorities, the risk of this increased.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior customs and immigration official, testified in Congress that the agency had arrested thousands of people who had registered to support children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
Mr Albanese said: “Nearly 80 percent of the people who were sponsored or from sponsored families are illegally residing in the country, and a large number of them are foreign criminals.
We are looking for those people.”
According to the shelter staff, in order to expedite the proceedings, the authorities announced new rules that would require some of these children to appear in court one month after their detention, instead of the previous standard that made it possible for them to appear in court 60 days after their detention.
Instead of being present in person, many defend themselves to obtain legal residency status against an immigration judge through video conferencing.
Those who are not eligible for legal protection are quickly deported.
According to shelter staff and reports from the system in recent months, the longer children remain in custody, the more they are exposed to stress and anxiety, which can lead to violence or attempted escape.
Proponents of the study said that concerns have peaked in larger centers such as Trenilo, where symptoms related to a child's difficulty with being in the center due to the large size of the facility may be overlooked.
They added that moving children to tent towns without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could exacerbate the trauma that many are currently struggling with.
Syria ordered U.S., French and Turkish "occupied forces" to withdraw immediately.
Syria’s foreign minister, Walid Maalal, said in his speech at the UN General Assembly that despite the war being in the country in its eighth year, he had urged the refugees to return to their homes.
The teacher, who also holds the post of deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and they will be dealt with appropriately.
He said: “They should leave the country as soon as possible without any conditions.”
In Syria, the war against terrorism is almost over, which has killed more than 360,000 people and displaced millions from their homes since 2011.
"Damascus will continue this holy war until we clear all areas of Syria from terrorist groups and the presence of any illegal foreign forces," he said.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in a war-torn country.
As for the refugees, the teacher said the conditions were appropriate for their return, blaming some Western countries for causing irrational fears that would keep refugees away from Syria.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return,” he said.
They have turned a purely humanitarian issue into a political one.
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction assistance to Syria until an agreement is reached between Assad and opposition forces to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say about the recent agreement between Syria and Turkey that a fenced area has been built in the main rebel base in Idlib, which has created opportunities for political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale offensive by Syrian-backed forces into the area where three million people live.
However, the teacher emphasized that the agreement had a “definite period” and hoped that the military operation would target jihadists, including al-Nusra Front fighters affiliated with al-Qaeda.
U.N. Representative Stephen Demistura hopes to convene the first meeting of a new committee of government and opposition members to write a draft constitution for Syria after the war and prepare the way for elections.
The teacher explained the conditions of the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying the task force should be “restricted to examine constitutional material” and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win Next Round
With that logic, Mr Trump will win the 2020 re-election unless liberal observers hope his impeachment and scandal will put an end to it before his term ends.
“It will undoubtedly be the saddest end of American presidential history.”
Currently, there is no sign of eyewitness helplessness.
Since 2014, the most-watched hours ranking has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen Fox News, there were 2.4 million viewers in the hours of the show, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow’s “Show” reached the highest rating of cable television with over 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
ABC television producer Neil Bayer said about a cabinet minister who was “destroying the Capitol” after an attack “is a fire that people are drawn to because it’s not something we understand.”
Neil Scavelle, author of “Just the Funny Parts: and a few hard truths about joining the Hollywood Boys Club,” has another theory.
He recalled before the 2016 election that he had been in a taxi in Boston.
The driver told him he wanted to vote for Mr. Trump.
He asks why?
“Mrs. Scavelle said to me, ‘She said, ‘Because it makes me laugh.’”
Chaos has a lot of fun.
Certainly, like nothing else on television, the stories coming out of Washington are the future against Wade, whether immigrant families can be together again and determine the health of the global economy.
Ignorance is an issue that only those with special privileges can overcome.
And yet, when you realize it’s been six hours, watching a group of experts discuss using “deep background” for Bob Woodward’s “Fear” book, the 15,000-dollar manafort ostrich leather jacket Paul Manafort’s (“a kind of thick coat” according to the Washington Post) and the hidden meanings in Stormy Daniels’ harsh description of Mr. Trump’s anatomy, the issue goes beyond being a citizen.
“As a person, I no longer look at Super Mario as I once did.
Brent Montgomery, the executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Stars in the Rolling Stones,” commented on the daily casting and design changes (fighting with the American Football League, admiring Kim Jong-un) on Trump’s television show: “Part of what he’s doing to make a real show feel like he’s giving you something every night.”
You can’t lose a part, so you stay behind.
When I met Mr. Felice this week, it was 80 degrees Fahrenheit on the north coast of Kauai, but he was watching MSNBC inside while recording the CNN show.
He could not depart from it, he could not depart from Brett Kavanaugh, who had been compelled to face the House Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court, which was uncertain.
Mr. Felice told me, “I remember when we did those ridiculous shows in the past, people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization.’”
“I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Monetary resources from abroad became the toughest internal mid-term elections.
It’s no surprise that Pennsylvania’s 17th district has seen cash pouring in thanks to the unification of congressional districts, which led to two rivals competing for a seat.
This has recently triggered a Democratic Party revival on the outskirts of Pittsburgh. Connor Lamb – who won a special regional election last spring.
Lamb is competing with other electoral rival, Republican Keith Ratfus, who recently ran for the 12th District of Old Pennsylvania, and the area is heavily interfering with the new 17th.
The plans were changed in January after the Supreme Court declared the old districts to be unconstitutional and unfairly divided in favor of the Republicans.
The competition in the new District 17 sparked a fierce competition between the financial branches of the major parties, between the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was named after a close race and victory in a special election held in March for the 18th Congressional District, which was witnessed by many.
The chair was run by the Republican Party for a decade, and Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts looked positively at the Democrats.
The United States suspended El Salvador’s punishment for supporting China at the time.
Diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama, a short distance away from Washington, have now accepted Beijing.
Mr Trump met with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and stayed in a hotel in Panama until the partners fired the Trump administration team.
State Department spokeswoman Heather Noort said in a statement earlier this month that U.S. officials had decided to recall senior U.S. officials from the diplomatic missions of El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "the recent decision not to support Taiwan".
But the punishment only applied to El Salvador, who received about $140 million in aid for drug control, development and financial support from Americans.
The proposed punishment, which included cuts in grants and visa restrictions, had a painful effect on the Central American country and its high unemployment rate and the number of murders.
As domestic meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to attend a similar event last year, a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
But by mid-September, senior government officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, effectively ending any investigation into the El Salvador Penal Code.
Diplomats said it was planned for Vice President Mike Pence to deliver a speech at the conference, scheduled to take place in mid-October, demonstrating the importance the government attaches to the gathering.
Three U.S. ambassadors returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic with no warning or punishment from Washington.
Three U.S. officials, two of whom are diplomats, agreed to discuss internal negotiations on the condition of anonymity, said White House spokesman Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which was explained by three U.S. officials.
Their explanations were confirmed by a foreign analyst close to the government in terms of anonymity.
Study of History
The next inevitability could be the report by Robert Mueller, the special adviser, on Trump’s possible obstruction of law enforcement, which has sufficient evidence in the public mind.
According to the report, Mueller is conducting investigations into whether Mr. Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia about attacking our elections.
If Congress changes its side, Mr. Trump will find himself responding to Congress and perhaps a jury of his peers just as he prepares to face voters.
Of course, but if there is a lot, and I don’t mean that the fall of Mr. Trump or his counterparts in Europe is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic we all have to make decisions that will affect how long this will take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler, only the West would resist him and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to prevent years of massacres that followed.
The course of history revolves around such milestones, and the impermanent parade of democracy slows or accelerates.
Now Americans are facing several milestones like this.
What would we do if Mr. Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since the news came out last year, suggesting that he secretly recorded the president’s conversations and commented on Trump’s inappropriate character for the presidency.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is not accurate.
“What will we do if the FBI’s new investigation of Brett Kavanaugh isn’t complete or fair — or if he is summoned to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of rape and false testimony?”
And most importantly, are we going to vote for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable in the midterm elections?
If we fail in these tests, democracy will fall into a long winter's sleep.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was taken to the Auschwitz detention center by the same Nazi regime that occupied the house of my ambassador.
He survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, he sent me to light the Sabbath candles on a table marked by the Nazi Crucifixion.
These are my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?”

Graham Dorset from the Rangers team, optimistic for the upcoming match with Wayne.
The Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday and know that a victory against Austrians, after a draw earlier this month against Villarreal Spain, will strengthen their position in the G-League for the next round.
The injury to Graham Doris' knees prevented him from making his debut in the new season until he scored 2-2, but he believes the Rangers could use the result as a launch pad to achieve greater success.
The 31-year-old said: “It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team.
“We entered the game with the belief that we could achieve something and came out with a point.
“Maybe we could have put that ball in the goal, but overall it was a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but in the second half we did better.
Thursday will be another big European night.
"Fortunately, we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they scored well in their last game, but I'm sure with the crowd that they support we can push and get a positive result.
"Last year was a really hard year, despite what happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself, it feels good to be here.
The players are in good condition and the kids really enjoy it; the exercises are good.
"Fortunately, we can move forward, get past last season and be successful."
Worrying about retirement savings steals sleep from women’s eyes
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they would like to be cared for, some of them were talking about it with their families.
About half of the people in the study said they talked to their spouses about the long-term costs of care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
Holly Schneider, vice president of life insurance company, said: “People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t go ahead with the conversation.”
This is where we have to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: If you don’t set your demands in advance, you won’t be able to prepare your family for care.
Talk to your legal counsel and your family about where and how to get care, as these elections can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Get help from your financial advisor: A financial advisor can help you find a way to pay for the expenses.
Your financial choices for long-term care can include a common long-term insurance policy, or life insurance based on the value of money to cover these costs, or self-indulgence with your wealth – as long as you have the money.
Set up your legal documents: you win in the legal battles.
Make a health care attorney to appoint a trusted person to monitor your medical care and make sure that the specialists will comply with your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider the use of a lawyer in financial matters.
You choose a reliable person to make your financial decisions and make sure that the bills are paid if you are unable to do so.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about the medications he is taking and the sensitivities he has?
Bring the details to the section on paper to be ready.
Mr. Martin asked, “It’s not just financial matters that matter, it’s also who the doctors are.”
What medications are being taken?
Who took care of the dog?

Category: Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
Officials said at least 384 people were killed in the earthquake and tsunami in Palo Indonesia, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the disconnection of communication lines, relief officials were unable to obtain information from the Dangala region, a region north of Palo, which is the region closest to the center of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
In Palo, more than 16,000 people evacuated.
Some of the key facts of Palo and Danglars on the island of Salussi include:
Palu is the capital of the central region of Salassi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Salassi, with a population of approximately 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Dangala is an area stretching over 300 kilometers (180 miles) along the northwest coastline of the island of Salavasi.
It is a smaller administrative area than a province, with a population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture is the main economy in the center of Salavasi, especially in the coastal part of Dangala.
Nickel extraction is also important in the region, but most of the mines in Moorwali are concentrated in the opposite part of Saloisi.
According to the Indonesian Natural Disaster Management Agency, Palo and Dungala have been hit by a tsunami several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dungala.
Another tsunami in West Dungala killed nine people in 1996.
Indonesia is in the Atlantic Ring of Fire, and earthquakes occur regularly.
A number of major earthquakes have occurred in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Ake region in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a major tsunami that killed 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of them in Ake.
2005: A number of strong earthquakes rocked the West Coast of Sumatra in March and April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 magnitude south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggered a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentawa, in Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed nearly 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake in the Pidi Jaya region in Ake, triggered panic and fear among the people who remembered the deadly tsunami disaster of 2004.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people were killed after falling from buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes occurred on the tourist island of Lambek, which killed 500 people, most of the deaths were from the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of homes and left thousands of tourists temporarily homeless.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Tarek Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor Sarah Palin and vice-presidential nominee, has been arrested on charges of sexual assault.
The 29-year-old Palin, from Wasila, Alaska, was reportedly arrested on Saturday for alleged domestic violence, interference in reports of domestic violence and resistance to arrest.
According to police reports, when a female acquaintance tries to call the police to report the crime, she takes her phone.
According to KTUU, Palin was detained in the pre-trial building of Matt-su and held on anonymized bonds of $500.
According to the network, he appeared in court on Saturday, declaring himself “innocent with confidence” when asked for his defense.
Palin faces three first-degree felony charges, meaning he could be jailed for up to a year and be fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a second-degree felony and was sentenced to one day in prison and paid $2,000 in fines.
This is the first time Palin has been charged with a criminal offence.
In December 2017, he was accused of beating his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently in the hands of a retired Alaska military court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering in the reporting of domestic violence, and carrying firearms while drunk in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he had hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticised by retired military groups for her son’s violent behavior toward post-traumatic stress disorder after serving in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in the Indonesian earthquake on Friday on the island of Salavasi.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Power grid and communications are down, and the probability of casualties in the coming days is high.
The earthquake occurred in the center of Salavasi, north of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos posted on social media show the moment of the incident.
When the tsunami struck, hundreds of people gathered to celebrate the beach in Palu.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for New York terror suspect
The New York federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for the suspected terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that hasn't been enforced for federal crimes since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipovo used a rental truck from Home Depot to carry out a cycling assassination on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, with it hitting pedestrians and cyclists in October.
In order to justify the death penalty in the Southern District of New York, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious physical harm on them.
According to court documents, both of them are likely to face a death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, a high-ranking federal jury charged Saipov with 22 counts, including eight counts of smuggling-related homicide, an indictment commonly used by the federal prosecutor to refer to organized crimes, and a charge of violence and motor vehicle destruction.
Prosecutors said the attack required “a lot of careful planning and planning” and described what Saipov had done as “horrible, cruel and devious.”
The crime's intent statement says that Sayfullah Habibullah Ivic Saipov caused injuries, injuries and deaths of family members and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Anne Decott, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Hernan Frouchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Paganoku.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
A decade has passed since the last death penalty was imposed in the southern New York area.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death sentence was carried out in a New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after being convicted of espionage for the Soviet Union two years before the Cold War.
Both were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court records, Saipovo, a native of Uzbekistan, did not say anything in the days and months following the attack.
Police said he told detectives he felt good about what he had done.
According to the report, Saipov told authorities that he was motivated by the assassination after watching ISIS videos on his mobile phone.
Police also said he had also requested the Islamic State flag to be raised at the hospital.
He pleaded guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the lawyers of the federal public defenders who advocates for Yaipov, said they were “clearly disappointed by the prosecutor’s decision.”
“We think that the decision to issue the death penalty instead of agreeing to the offender’s request for life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of those involved,” Patton said.
The Saipov defense team had previously asked the prosecutor not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP Says Nigel Farage Should Be Responsible for Brexit Talks
Nigel Farage pledged, “The Army mobilized the people today in protest at the Conservative Party conference.
Former leader Yukip said politicians should “confront the pressure of the close opposition between the UK and the EU” — as a member of the May Parliament suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Peter Boone, a member of the Legislative Board of the House of Commons, told marches in Birmingham that Britain had already exited if Mr. Fraser was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge that Ms. May faces in conciliating the two-party members of her cabinet has been addressed by the Conservatives who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to follow a no-deal exit plan amid attacks by Brexit supporters, those who remain in the EU and the EU.
The Allies insisted that despite strong reactions, he would try to make a deal with Brussels — forcing forces opposed to the closeness between Britain and the EU and the Labour Party to choose between his proposed package or “chaos.”
Mr. Boone said he wanted to “stop the no-deal exit plan.”
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have partners in the responsibilities given to the Brussels negotiations.
He said, “If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now.”
Parliamentary member Walenberg added: “I will stand up for your election, but we need to stop the plan for a no-deal exit.”
While expressing his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We did not fight in the world wars to bring us down.
We want to set our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Boone denied that public opinion has changed since 2016. “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in Europe is completely false.”
Andrea Jenkins, a member of the Conservative Party, was also on the march, saying to reporters: “It’s very simple: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
A no-deal exit is not popular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, our party and our political activists, who actually work on the streets and make us elected representatives, are not interested in this plan.
Please let go of the no-deal plan and start listening.
She added in a stinging message to Ms. May: Prime Ministers keep their place when they keep their promises.
Ghai Farage told the marchers that if politicians were to break the decision taken in the 2016 referendum, they would have to “confront pressure.”
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us, the people and the political class.”
They want to betray Britain’s exit from the EU, but we’re here today to tell them, “We’re not going to let you get out of the palace.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I ask you to form our political group, so that those on the brink of betrayal of Britain’s exit from the European Union will face pressure.
“We will move this country’s popular army, which will win the UK’s exit from the European Union, and we will never rest to have an independent, sovereign, and proud England.”
At the same time, supporters of remaining in the EU marched in Birmingham before a two-hour rally in the city center.
After Brexit’s opposition conservative group began working on the weekend, few activists raised the party’s banners.
Labour member Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security of a party program at the start of the conference.
“These are people telling us they can install IT systems and they can provide all the technology needed for Canada Plus to have a free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
This is totally ridiculous.
He said there is no such thing as a good UK exit from the EU.
Warren plans to "carefully" think about his nomination for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says after the November election, she “thinks carefully about her nomination for president.”
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a Saturday town meeting in West Massachusetts.
Warren, the usual critic of Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November to compete against Republican and Jeffrey Diehl, who was the head of Trump’s Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
He has been at the center of speculation that he may be a rival to Trump in the 2020 election.
The Saturday afternoon event in Hollyoke has been his 36th meeting with voters, which has taken the form of a public meeting with the people since Trump’s presidency.
One of the people asked him if he wanted to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for “women to go to Washington to reform and rebuild our dysfunctional government, and that requires a woman to be at the top.”
Man Arrested During Deadly Shooting at Soames, Louisiana State University
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced that the suspect in Friday's deadly shooting at Louisiana State University basketball player Wade Sims was arrested.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced at an 11 a.m. Eastern Time news conference that Dayton Simpson, 20, had been arrested.
They released a video of Friday’s shooting, asking for help identifying the man in the film.
Sims, 20, was shot dead Friday morning near the university’s southern campus.
Police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on 247sports on Saturday that “Wade Sims was injured in a gunshot to the head and eventually died.”
Wade intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to having been on the scene with a gun, and admitted to having shot Widgets.
Simpson was arrested without incident and is in detention at the East Rugby Concrete District Police Department.
Samiz, a 182-centimeter young, who grew up in Rogue concrete, played in 32 races and scored 10 times in the last season, with an average score of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia’s Grand Prix: After the team led Lewis Hamilton to win over Sebastian Vettel, Lewis took one step closer as the world moved closer.
On Saturday, it was clear from the moment Walterry Bottas took over Lewis Hamilton that the Mercedes team would play a big part in the match.
Bottas had a good start from the first line and almost separated from Hamilton to defend his position in the first two rounds, allowing Votel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first person to get into Pete Stop and let Hamilton get into the traffic on the last car, something that would definitely happen.
Mercedes made a second trip to Pittstop and appeared from behind the motel, but Hamilton drove a side-by-side car after a few moves because the Ferrari driver reluctantly separated from the road and risked going to third place after a double move.
Max Verstappen started in the rear row and finished seventh on his 21st birthday at the end of the first round.
Then, for most of the race, he was the first, and he didn’t change his tires because he wanted to get to the finish line quickly and beat Kimi Raikkonen to become the fourth.
He eventually entered Pete Stop in the forty-fourth round, but failed to increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds and became Rykonen IV.
It was a hard day because Walterry did a wonderful job this weekend, and he was a really nice guy who let me pass him.
"Hamilton said the team has done exceptional work with two winners.
The non-verbal communication was really bad.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Diane Feinstein at an election rally on Saturday for her insistence not to disclose the contents of Christine Blasi Ford’s letter about the alleged rape of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The president, speaking at an election rally in West Virginia, did not directly mention Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead stated that what is going on in the Senate shows how “post, dirty, and liar people are.”
“What might happen in the Senate, and what’s beautiful about it over the last few days, is that when you see anger, you see people who are angry, mean, dirty, and liars.”
“They spread the news and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.’”
“I didn’t do that.”
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you reveal the news?
Remember his answer... Did you expose the document? “Oh, oh, what do you say?”
“Oh, no.
I didn’t reveal it.”
Well, wait a minute.
He added in a tone similar to that of the senator: “Did we expose the news? ... No, we didn’t.
A letter was sent to Finstein, in which Ford made allegations against Kavanaugh in July last year, and the contents of the letter were revealed in early September – but Finstein denied the leak was from his office.
I have not concealed Dr. Ford’s accusations, I have not disclosed his case,” is part of Hill’s report citing Finstein’s remarks in the committee.
“He asked me to keep it secret, and I did it as he asked me to.”
But his denial was not convincing to the president, who criticized Saturday night’s rally: “I’ll tell you what really happened, it was a really bad non-verbal communication issue.”
Maybe he didn’t, but it’s the worst nonverbal communication I’ve ever seen.”
The president continued his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, whom three women have accused of sexual misconduct, stating that the Democrats were using the charges in their favor.
“They are determined to take back power in every possible way.
In a statement, the president said: “You see badness and badness, they don’t care who they hurt, they don’t care who they pass on to get power and control.”
Premier League: Dundee Starz 5-3 took the Belfast Giants ahead
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants in a match against Dundee.
Dundee Starz's team compensated Friday's defeat in the Premier League against Belfast Giants and won the team 5-3 on Saturday.
With the attacks of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Boehlyer, Giants was able to score two goals in the first game.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney matched the game, but then Dior scored the best goal for Giants.
Franco Bouchard equalized the match for Dundee, but again Lucas Landwald Nielsen scored two victorious goals for Dundee.
This was Adam Kiew's third Premier League defeat this season, which had beaten Dundee 2-1 at Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, while Giants won his previous three matches against the team.
The first goal of the game was scored by Dwyer at 3:35 in the fourth minute by the Kendall McPheele, and four minutes later Boehler scored the second goal by David Ruthford.
It was semi-hypocritical, and Sullivan brought the hosts back to play at 13:10, but Matt Marcort helped score the match at 15:16.
When Dwyer scored his second goal at the end of the first half that night, he was sure that Giants had won the first half.
The host team regained unity on their pitch, and Bouchard scored again with a powerful goal at 27:37.
Cooni and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nilson advance Dundee for the first time in the last minutes of the second half, and eventually secured their victory in the middle of the final half with his fifth goal.
Giants, who has now lost four of his five games, will play his next match at home with Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air traffic controller sacrificed his life to save hundreds of people on plane to escape earthquake
Indonesians have dubbed the Air Traffic Controller a hero for his dedication to safe flight of a plane carrying hundreds of people.
In the aftermath of a major earthquake on Sulawesi Island on Friday, more than 800 people were killed and countless are missing.
Violent tremors continue to disrupt life in the area, and many people are trapped under the rubble of the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Ganavan Agang did not leave his post at the heavily shaking control tower at the Moticara Sis El Jufrey Airport in Palo.
He stayed there to make sure that the 6321 Batik, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
And then, when he sees the tower falling, he jumps out.
He later lost his life in the hospital.
According to ABC News Australia, Indonesian aviation spokesman Johannes Sirritt said the decision saved hundreds of lives.
We got a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the plane arrived in Palu.
He added: “We broke our hearts when we heard this news.
At the same time, officials are concerned that the death toll could rise to thousands, and the country’s natural disaster management agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Botong is limited.
IAEA spokesman Sotopo Porvo Noguero said: “We think the death toll will continue to rise because there are still many bodies under the rubble and many of them are not accessible.”
Waves of up to six metres have made Palu a dumpster, and a mass funeral will be held in the city on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft also brought aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “An ambulance full of bodies arrives here every minute.”
Healthy water is scarce.
“Everywhere they stole the goods of small shops.”
John Gelfand, of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will face there.
It’s sad, but it could have been much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I want you all to work day and night to do the evacuation work.
“Are you ready for this?” CNN reported.
Earlier this year, an earthquake in Lambak, Indonesia, killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Newgini airline now says a man is missing after plane crashes into lake
The airliner, which crashed into a lake in the Pacific in Micronesia after its earlier statement that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane, now says one man is missing.
On Saturday afternoon, Nyugini announced that one of the passengers on the flight had died.
The airline said it was working with local officials, hospitals and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to questions about the passenger’s accurate information, such as his age and nationality.
The plane crashed into the water after attempting an emergency landing from Chooke airport runway, and local boats came to rescue passengers and crew.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday and all were stable.
The exact cause of the crash is not yet known.
The U.S. Airline and Navy both said the plane crashed due to the short runway in the lake.
Witnesses said the plane had been pulled out of the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jens said the plane's altitude was too low at the time of landing.
Janes said, “That was a very good thing.”
Janes said he and others were able to work hard on the sinking plane and walk in the water that reached their waist and reach emergency exits.
She said the flight attendants were frightened and screamed, and that she herself had suffered a minor injury to the head.
The U.S. Navy also said sailors who were working on the dock near the plane had rushed to rescue people using an inflatable boat before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) into the water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows 111 people have died in a plane crash in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but this figure does not include Newgini.
The analyst presented the timetable for the night in which the woman was burned alive.
On Saturday, the trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Roulette, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of information analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used phone reports to bring together the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of the incident.
According to Clarion Ledger’s report, Roulette said he obtained location information from several cell phones, indicating that Tellis was with him on the night of Chambers’ death, which is inconsistent with the defendant’s previous claim.
When the data showed that his phone was with his friend Michelle Sanford when she claimed to be with him, the police went to investigate Sanford.
Sanford stood on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis’s claim was true that he was in the Sanford car that night, he said he was lying because my car was in Nashville that night.
Another paradox is that Tellis said he had known him for about two weeks when Chambers died.
Mobile phone reports indicated that they had only been dating for a week at the time.
Roulette said that after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, contacts, and contact information from his phone.
Hale said, “Talis took him out of his life.”
The final hearing will be held on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed down to the jury the same day.
Hip Hop: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
A trio of hip-hop musicians want to challenge the negative attitude to this type of music by filling their music with positive messages.
Breed groups, from Bristol, claim that hip hop has distanced itself from the principle of expressing political messages and addressing social issues.
They want to bring this style of music back to its origin and make hip-hop popular again.
Artists from bands such as Fujiz and Kamen have observed that artists such as Akala and Loki have recently revived music in the UK.
Another black man again?
A New York nurse has sued a couple because they fired him after sending him a “racist” message.
A New York nurse has complained about a couple who fired her for racist reasons, because she received a wrong message from her mother complaining that the nurse is another black person.
The couple denies being racist, and compares the complaint to extortion.
When the nurse went to their home for their first day of work in 2016, Linsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, found out that the new babysitter, Giselle Morris, was black and worried.
Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband, “I don’t want another black man again.”
However, instead of sending this message to his wife, he sent it to Ms. Morris twice.
After realizing his mistake, Ms. Plasco Fluxman fired Ms Morris, saying that her “unpleasant” African-American nurse had done a bad thing while she was waiting for a Filipino nurse, according to the New York Post.
Ms Morris was paid a day’s work and then sent home by an online taxi.
Now, Morris has sued the couple to pay for the dismissal, asking for $350 a day for six months, and being hired without a contract to stay in place for a fixed period of time.
He told the New York Post on Friday, “I want to show them that they know, that they don’t do things like that, and that I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded in a harsh tone to the allegations that they were racist, saying it was wise to dismiss him because they thought he could no longer be trusted after being insulted.
“My wife sent him a message and he didn’t mean it.
He is not racist.
Her husband, Joel Plasco, told the New York Post: “We are not racists.”
But will you leave your child to someone you have treated rudely, even if you did it wrong?
Your newborn baby?
Come on.”
Analyzing the complaint, Plasco stated that his wife had taken two months off for the birth of their child and was “in a difficult situation.”
The head of the investment bank added, “Do you want to look for someone like him?
His choice is not good.”
While the complaint is still ongoing, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media and harshly criticized them for their behavior and logic.
The new letter reveals that Paddington’s publishers were concerned that readers could not communicate with the talking bear.
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “Before the book is published, it’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who is going to read it for the first time.
Knowing what we know today about Paddington’s great success is very interesting.”
He says his father was a BBC cameraman before being inspired by a little toy bear to write for kids, was optimistic about his book’s rejection, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book’s release after his father’s death last year was “sweet.”
He described Paddington as “a very important member of our family,” adding that his father was absolutely proud of the ultimate success of his work.
He said, “My father was a very quiet man, not a proud man.”
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it’s like you have a child who gets something: you’re proud of him, even though you haven’t actually done it.
I think that’s how he saw Paddington’s success.
Though he created Paddington and was born of his imagination, he always attributed the success of the work to Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After the fall of his daughter, he was quickly transferred to the Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, but the efforts of doctors to save him were futile.
Mrs. Adnan-Laprose said: “Nad kept calling to tell me that my daughter was really bad, and that she didn’t think she would survive.”
“Then Nad called me to tell me that he would be gone in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to him.
And I did.
“I said, ‘I love you so much, my dear.’
I will join you soon.
I will be with you.
The medications given to him by the doctors to keep his heart alive were beginning to become ineffective and out of his body.
He had died a few minutes earlier, and all his organs were failing.
I just had to sit there and wait, and all this was happening to me.
As I was among other families and people, I couldn’t moan, scream, or cry.
I really had to keep my calm.
Finally, Mrs. Adnan-Lapros, now mourning for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers, while she forgot the tragedy that had befallen her.
He said, “Nobody knew.”
“I kept my head down and I was still crying.”
It’s hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I felt compassion for Nad.
That Nad needed my love and I had to understand him.
I knew how much Nad loved him.
Women mourn by placing cards on the bridge in an attempt to prevent others from committing suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones for suicide try to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put cards on Welsh Bridge that contain inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call to ask for help.
Mrs. Davis’ son, Tyler, was 13 when he became depressed and killed himself at the age of 18.
“I don’t want families to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Leiden, said her son was a future chef with a beautiful smile.
Everyone knew him with his smile.
They always said that her smile would brighten every home.
However, he quit his job before he died, because “his place of work was really dark.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, was the first to find his lifeless body.
Ms Davis said: “I’m always worried that this will have a negative impact on her.”
Ms. Davis made the cards, “to tell people that there is someone they can ask for help or talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t sit still – you need to talk.”
Ms. Humphreys, who has been friends with Ms. Deweys for years, lost Mark shortly after her mother’s death, who had been in a relationship with her for 15 years.
“Mark didn’t say he felt sad or depressed or anything like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
Christmas Day was so depressing that when the kids opened their presents, they didn’t look at them or anything.”
Mark’s death was a huge blow to them, he said, but they had to leave it behind: “It’s going to break the family as a whole.
His sadness kills us.
But we all have to live and fight hard.”

The future purgatory of Brett Kavanaugh begins with FBI investigations.
Mr. Flick said on Saturday, “I thought, if we could really do what he wants — i.e., research in limited time, with limited scope — we might be able to achieve a little unity,” adding that he was afraid that the committee would “disintegrate in the midst of a dead end without a party.”
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not ask the FBI to start an investigation?
It’s unforgivable because of time.
There are only five weeks left until the November 6 midterm elections, and if, as expected, the Republicans are doing badly, their efforts to find the man they want to be elected to the Supreme Court will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call senators and lobby them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who at the time was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes the report?
The Senate has 51 Republican seats and 49 Democrats.
It is not clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to win at least 50 votes in the Senate, so Vice President Mike Pence can cast his own vote and make him the head of the Supreme Court.
Decreased number of North Korean refugees under Kim’s rule
A South Korean lawmaker has said that since Kim Jong-un took office seven years ago, the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined.
Park-Byung-Syug quoted South Korea’s Unity Ministry as saying last year we had 1,127 asylum cases, down from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher wages for smugglers were among the most influential factors.
Pyongyang has made no public comments.
Most refugees from North Korea will eventually be granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people flee through the border with China, as it has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded civilian zone between the two Koreas.
China sees the refugees as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often forcibly sends them home.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss nuclear disarmament talks that had been halted.
This came after a historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, and after a general agreement between the two sides on the Korean Peninsula’s nuclear disarmament.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ray Yang-ho, blamed the U.S. sanctions on a lack of progress in the nuclear negotiations since then.
In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Mr. Ray said, “If we can’t trust the United States, we can’t be sure of our national security, and under such circumstances, we won’t unilaterally step forward and disarm ourselves.”
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is “hysterical” and unsuitable for Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has called the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh a “hysterian” and said she is not well-behaved to serve in the Supreme Court.
On Saturday, Pelosi expressed criticism in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
Speaking about his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, Pelosi said: "I couldn't say it, I think if a woman acted that way, they would call her a 'histarian'."
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that when Christine Blasi Ford and she were both teenagers, she raped him.
Kavanaugh was emotional at the beginning of his talk, and when he talked about his family and high school years, he would sometimes almost scream and be heard.
He has also clearly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him “a ridiculous and coordinated character assassination” organized by the Liberals because they are nervous about Hillary Clinton’s defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it showed he was anti-democratic.
“I think Kavanaugh showed by his speech that he is not qualified for the job and by the way he talks about Clinton and the Democrats, he is incompetent,” he said.
When Pelosi was asked if Kavanaugh would be elected, and if the Democrats would again have a majority in the House, he would try to bring charges against him, his answer was no.
“I’m saying that — if he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it’s not suitable for the Supreme Court or the court in which he’s currently working,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently serving a hearing in the Washington Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat concerned about possible opposition votes issued by Kavanaugh against the Affordable Medical Care Act or the law against Wade because he is a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh declined to answer questions about whether he would return some of the Supreme Court’s decisions.
Pelosi said, “It’s not the time for a hysterical, fanatic person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘What an interesting thing.’”
Women need to manage their crying.
It's a bitter criticism, it's months and years of anger, and she can't let go of it without crying.
Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later, “We cry when we get nervous.”
“I don’t think it’s unusual, do you?”
“The woman who was the manager helped me a lot, and she told me that she was crying when she got nervous, but she developed a technique that when she got nervous and she was crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘I’m crying because I’m upset.’”
I am angry.”
And then he continued to do it.
And I thought it was a very good technique.”
Tears are partly meant to eject anger because tears are basically misinterpreted.
One of the most vivid memories I have of my first job in an office with mostly male employees is that when I cried out of indescribable intense anger, the older woman held back my neck — an abusive manager that I was always a little afraid of — and took me to the stairs.
He told me, “Don’t ever let them see you cry.”
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re upset and they’re happy because they’ve hurt you.”
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart when she ran for president.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was seen riding on a boat with a strange woman named Monkey Business and dropped out of the race, Ms. Schroeder, who was desperately disappointed, realized there was no reason not to run for president himself.
Thirty years later, he laughed at me and said, “It’s not a decision I’ve thought about very well.”
“There were seven other candidates in the presidential race, and my nomination was the last thing they wanted.
One person called it “White Snow and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Because it was too late for the campaign, and he didn’t have time to raise funds, he swore he wouldn’t compete until he raised $2 million.
The fight was a failure.
He found that some of his supporters, who gave men $1,000, gave him only $250.
He was surprised and thought to himself, “Do you think I’ll get a discount?”
When he began his speech and announced that he was not going to start an official campaign, he was so impressed – he appreciated the people who supported him, he was helpless about a system that made it difficult to raise money and not to find voters instead of representatives, and he was angry because of gender discrimination – he was heard expressing those feelings.
Ms. Schroeder recalled how the media reacted to her, “We have a neural disorder.”
“You thought Clint was my sponsor.”
I remember thinking, what are they going to write on my gravestone?
“Did he cry?”
How the U.S.-China trade war might benefit Beijing
Experts say the shelling of a trade war between the United States and China was deafening, and while the fight is still far from over, the rift between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
Earlier this year, U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning by imposing taxes on Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
Trade tensions between the two countries peaked this week with new tariffs on $200 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 billion) of goods, or more than half of all goods imported from China to the United States.
Beijing has retaliated in some way each time, with the latest example being a 5 to 10 percent tariff on $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has vowed to compete – step by step – with the U.S., and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will shake with these winds any time soon.
Getting Washington out of the decision it has made would mean surrendering to his demands, but it would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping to publicly bow to the United States.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing can play well with its cards, the pressures of the U.S. trade war could have a positive impact on China in the long run by reducing interdependence between the two countries.
Abigail Grace, a researcher working on Asian issues at the U.S. New Security Center’s Think Tank, said: “The fact that a political decision without thought from Washington or Beijing can create conditions that cause economic collapse in any country is far more dangerous than observers have already acknowledged.”
Syrian Foreign Minister Says Syria Is Ready to Return Refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary repatriation of refugees and is asking other countries to help rebuild it, which has devastated the war for more than seven years.
When Syria’s foreign minister, Walid Maalal, spoke at the UN General Assembly, he said the situation in his country was getting better.
“Today, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism, the situation in Syria has become more stable and safe,” he said.
The government is trying to rebuild the areas that terrorists have devastated and bring normal life back to the country.
All conditions are in place for the voluntary repatriation of refugees who have left the country because of terrorism and because of unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
“The Syrian regime welcomes assistance to rebuild this devastated country,” the teacher said.
But he stressed that he would not seek conditional assistance, as well as assistance from countries that supported the unrest in Syria.
The European Union has decided to seize the Ryder Cup in Paris.
By defeating the U.S. team and scoring a final score of 16.5 to 10.5, the European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup in France at the National Golf Championship outside Paris.
The United States has been defeated six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
When Danish captain Thomas Bourne scored the 14.5 they needed to defeat America, Europe won the World Cup again.
The American star, Phil Mickelson, who worked hard for most of the race, threw the ball into the water in the third blow of the 16th hole, and accepted his defeat against Francesco Molinari.
Molinari, an Italian golfer, shined through all stages of the game, becoming one of four players who have played 0-0-5 since the current form of the match began in 1979.
The lower-ranked European player, Turbon Elsen, from Denmark, eliminated American golfer Jordan Spit 5&4.
Dustin Johnson, the world's top player, lost 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter, who plays for England in his last Raider Cup.
Sergio Garcia, a veteran of the Eight Ryder Cup, has always won the most European competitions with 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I couldn’t stop crying.
It was a hard year.
Thank you so much for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so glad we got the cup back.
After winning Europe, Garcia said, “It’s the team’s problem, and I’m happy to be able to help.”
He gave his compatriot John Ram a chance to speak, who scored 2-1 in the singles on Sunday to beat American golf legend Tiger Woods.
Ram, 23, said, “I’m so proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this man play.”
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 professional record for the Ryder Cup.
This is strange for someone who has always been one of the best players and has won 14 titles since Jack Nichols.
The U.S. team spent the weekend trying to find places on the pitch where Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Fino weren’t there because the players were playing with all their talent and abilities throughout the match.
Captain America Jim Forrick, after his disappointing performance, said, “I’m proud of these players, they fought.”
This morning, we sometimes pushed for the European team.
We've ruined it.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He is a very good captain.
All 12 players played very well.

Red tide changes have reduced accumulation in the Pinelas, Manati, and Sarasota sectors
The Florida Wildlife and Fish Conservation Organization’s latest report shows that in parts of the Tampa Bay area, red tide has generally decreased.
According to the Florida Department of Wildlife and Fish Conservation, there have been partial accumulation conditions in areas of Pinelas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, indicating a decline in aggregation.
The red tide stretches almost 130 miles from the north coastline of Pinlas to the southern parts of Li.
The patches can be found about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but have been seen in fewer places than last week.
The red tide is also seen in Pascoe.
Over the past week, these have been reported: moderate gatherings in the Pinellas district and its offshore areas, low-to-high gatherings in the Hillsboro district, ground-to-ground gatherings in the Manati district, high-to-ground gatherings in the Sarasota district and high-to-middle gatherings in the Charlotte district, low-close gatherings in the Calais district.
In the Pinelas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee and Collier sections, respiratory distress is still reported.
No respiratory distress has been reported in northwest Florida over the past week.
