do you feel any pain or any symptoms of muscle pain?
Is there anybody else in your house who's sick and has the same symptoms as you?
Do you have any other symptoms?
Do you feel any shortness of breath?
are you still having chest pain
Because this is the flu season.
but we shouldn't be worried about chest pain as a source of heart disease
but a more important thing now is the chest pain
but I'm not breathing
But I know a lot of people cough on me.
but we have to deal with every chest pain with the utmost seriousness
But you're breathing really well right now, right?
because of this chest pain, i completely forgot
is it like somebody squeezes your chest
are you still feeling shortness of breath

I also have difficulty breathing
I'll send you an image
i'm having chest pain today
i'm having some headaches and some fever today
in my opinion it's influenza
In my opinion, it's a mild flu.
Is it like sitting a heavy person on your chest?
It all started with the headaches and the fever at the same time.
i feel pain in the middle of my chest
it's a stress like chest pain
it's in my chest
in the middle of my chest

Rapidly increasing cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The similarity of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK confirms that, although at stages vary according to countries, the incidence of COVID-19 is undergoing a rapid trend across all countries.
Based on the experiences of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their readiness to face the surge of COVID-19 patients requiring special care and intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases caused by an unknown cause was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention identified the cause of the disease as a novel coronavirus, now known as respiratory syndrome CoV-2-SARS-CoV.
Since then, the disease resulting from 2-SARS-CoV infection is known as COVID-19 coronavirus disease.
Evidence to date suggests that 80% of COVID-19 patients have a mild disease, namely a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and most recover.
14% of COVID-19 cases require hospitalization, and 6% of other patients require intensive care.
The mortality rate in confirmed cases of COVID-19 is around 4%.
In this study, we assess the trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom and compare them with that of Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with the number of cases in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
Subsequent to China, COVID-19 extended the geographic scope and the epidemiological trends of the coronavirus pandemic in other countries followed the same trend as China.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic an epidemic.
On 5 March 2020 according to Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri and colleagues reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to WHO definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported on 24 January 2020 in persons returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were reported in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the UK, resulting in between 31 December 2019 and 39,768 infections and 1,727 deaths, including 17,750 infections and 1,441 deaths each.
Obtaining cumulative numbers and cumulative numbers of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in all countries of the world can only be obtained from official sources such as the country's Ministry of Health, regional and WHO authorities and is updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to assess the trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK, and to compare them with that of Italy.
As an agent of the development of active cases of COVID-19, we have looked at the 14-day shortened cumulative incidence of cases of COVID-19, thus the natural course of COVID-19 was considered in each EU/EEA country and the UK during the 1 January-15 March 2020 period.
We also presented the cumulative number of notified cases from each country at 8:00 a.m. on 15 March compared to that from Italy in the 31 January-15 pain period.
Trends of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The shortened cumulative incubation rate of 14-days of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally follows the Hubei Province Rule in China (Figure 1).
In the European Union and the United Kingdom as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase on February 21, and on February 28, 2020, it saw a significant increase (mineral material).
This was mostly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases in Italy, but all other EU countries and the UK showed similar trends in their cumulative numbers of COVID-19.
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to Italy on the 31 January–15 March 2020.
This indicates that, as of 8:00 a.m. on May 15, the total number of cases in 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK was equal to that in Italy in three weeks or less.
Our results show that the number of notified COVID-19 cases is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Visible trends in the cumulative rate of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a similar pace across all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are both at different stages and have different national public health responses, and there are differences in the definition of cases and protocols for diagnosing patients to be tested for the purpose of confirming COVID-19 infection, among others.
In early March 2020, doctors in Italy's affected areas described a situation in which approximately 10% of COVID-19 patients require intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas had reached their peak capacity.
Data on the incubation of COVID-19 patients in a hospital and intensive care unit in the EU/EEA are now only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively.
However, these data should be collected in an organized manner to supplement current surveillance data that focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in March 2010 showed a significant difference in the availability of intensive care beds and intermediate care beds in Europe, with this number being 29.2 in Germany and 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in Portugal.
This indicates that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 people as of 11, 2020).
The scenarios associated with the reduction of health care capacity, with the incidence of cases in either EU/EEA and UK in the spread of cases requiring COVID-19 incidence, are associated with a risk of more than 90% increase in the capacity of intensive care beds, with a sixth update in the assessment of the risk of COVID-19 infection.
Since cases have been recorded in EU countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units serve a specific region's population, information about cases and intensive care beds is preferable to be taken from the Regional Units Dental Area Area Area Area Area Area Area Area Area Registered Statistics Level 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and the current trends of other countries shows that the COVID-19 virus is rapidly spreading in the European Union and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units must prepare themselves for a continuous community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2, as well as an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring medical care and, in some cases, intensive care, as is currently the case in affected areas of Italy.
While a recent assessment of ECDC's rapid risk has been made, a comprehensive and fast-acting approach is required to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with reversal changes from inhibition to mitigation, because according to the estimated rapid increase in the number of cases at the time it is not possible for hospitals to make decisions, to understand and to accept responses ahead of time, and to be able to accept and understand them.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the effects of the pandemic.
A small window of opportunity has now been opened that countries can increase their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on healthcare.
If this fails, the health care systems of other EU countries in the coming days or weeks will face the surge of patients in need of intensive care.
The epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019(19-COVID), caused by SARS-CoV-2 syndrome, has so far killed more than 3,000 people in China and other countries, and infected more than 80,000, which could cause catastrophe for humans.
Similar to its similar virus, SARS-CoV, which caused thousands of infections in 2003, the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus may have been transmitted from bats and caused similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
Although COVID-19 is less severe and fatal than SARS, it is much more transmissible and affects older people and men more often than young people and women.
In response to the increasing number of blockbusters associated with the emerging disease, this article provides a quick and comprehensive assessment of the rapidly developing research problem.
We cover the main causes of epidemiology, epidemiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention.
Although many questions still require answers, we hope that this evaluation can help to understand and prevent this dangerous disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 became an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for Chinese people as they were forced to spend all their holidays at home for many weeks after the outbreak of a novel viral disease.
The virus was very similar to CoV, which caused respiratory syndrome syndrome (SARS) in 2003; this is why it was named SARS-CoV-2 on February 11, 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has recorded 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, of which 40,000 have recovered and more than 3,000 have died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is "Public Enemy No. 1" and is much more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 articles have been published about COVID-19 that have areas of virology, epidemiology, epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of the disease distinct from the 2020 genome sequence after the first case has been reported.
This evaluation attempts to falter the research trends in this new, fast-moving field of development.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other CoV diseases and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an epidemic in 2012).
We'll also discuss what we know so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as some urgent and yet unanswered questions.
Coronaviruses are traditionally considered to be pathogens for humans and generally cause about 15% of common colds in humans.
However, in this century, we have encountered human CoVs twice, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an outbreak first in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and soon spread to many other countries and recorded a high incidence and horrific death.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third coronavirus pandemic in recorded human history.
As shown in Fig.1,1, pneumonia outbreaks of unknown origin were first reported from Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the China National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the sequence of CoVs was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first case of death in Wuhan was reported.
By then, an epidemic had spread rapidly in the surrounding cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, infection from health care workers was reported, and it was reported that the disease was transmissible from human to human.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was quarantined and all public transportation stopped.
On December 24, the first medical study reported that only 21 out of 41 confirmed cases of the disease had been directly exposed to the seafood market, and thus the first cause of the disease was identified from an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, the World Health Organization declared an outbreak of a global health emergency.
By the time of this report, the disease has spread throughout China and nearly 50 countries around the world. (Fig. 2.2).
Because the situation is rapidly evolving, the last period and severity of the epidemic remain open.
On 11 February 2020, a multidisciplinary study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented a newer picture of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but most were infected between the ages of 30-65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of the infected people were over 50, very few were under 20, and only 14 infected people were under 10.
SARS-CoV-2 is more infectious in men (0.31/100,000) than in women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 outbreaks generally occur in Hobey and surrounding areas.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (9-2) days to be diagnosed in a person.
On a moderate basis, the period of time between the early and late infectious disease is 4.8 (7.2–3.0) days.
Also, the average person dies during 9.5 (13–4.8) days.
The initial reproductive rate (R0) of the disease was 3.77 (95% CI:3.51-4.05), and the regulated reproductive rate was R0 4.82-2.32.
The number of infected people increased significantly before December 23, coinciding with the widespread transportation before the Spring Festival in China.
The death rate in confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted death rate in all cases was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (up to 60), and severe respiratory infection.
Coronaviruses are a family of large, enveloped viruses that form the single strain RNA.
The virus can be divided into four genera, i.e., alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alpha and beta-CoVs can infect humans.
In SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, spike glycoprotein (S) binds to the strand by binding angiotensin 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptor enzymes, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The virus's RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replicating the virus's genome, genomic RNA binds to glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins make viral vesicles that then combine with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-CoV containing 99.98% of the genetic definition of between 10 samples collected at the original site of the outbreak of the virus at Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through electromagnetic diffusion microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been observed in ultrasonic segments of the human airway lattice.
Human ACE2 was found to be a receptor for both SARS-Cov-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 much weaker than SARS-CoV, which is why SARS-CoV-2 infection-causing inflammation is less severe in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a novel cortisol protein encoded by orf3b and a protein encoded by orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in the viral pathogen and inhibit the expression of IFN<0xCE><0xB2>; however, orf8 does not have any known functional role.
On February 18, 2020, Zhu and colleagues announced the cryo-EM composition of the entire human ACE2 in 2.9 metabolization of A, in combination with the amino acid genome B0AT1.
They found that the structure, which was open and closed in two ways, was collected as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 compound could bind two S proteins, which provided evidence for the detection and transmission of CoVs.
B0AT1 can become a therapeutic target for drug testing by suppressing SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Primary and intermediate host
Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been thought to be the source of bats, and the virus has been transmitted to humans by civet cats and camels.
By comparing the phylogenetic of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, bats were identified as the original host of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus because this new virus was 96% identical to the two SARS-ZX-CoVs and the other SARS-CoV-CoV called bat-SL.
However, what intermediate hosts do to help the virus cross species barriers and human transmission remains undetected, and the transmission routes still need to be cleared.
G. et al., identified the Marian as the carrier of the virus from bats to humans, creating a homologous interaction with type S proteins.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, reported that pangolin - a male mammal that is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine - may be the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2, since it has 99% genetic equivalence between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin.
However, the one percent genetic difference between the two viruses is still a big difference, so more concrete evidence is expected to emerge from the results as shown (Fig.33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet fully understood.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for up to 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20<0xC2><0xB0>C and a humidity level of 40-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar characteristics.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and temperatures of 56 degrees centigrade for up to 30 minutes; clomiphene, ethanol, 75%; chlorine, if it contains an effective antiviral, acid peristal, chloroform, and chromium toners, other than chloride.
Humans generally lack immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and are more likely to be infected with the new virus.
Currently, no detailed research has been reported on the resilient response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only make reference to previous studies on CoVs, in particular SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig.4).
In general, after attacking its host, the virus is first recognized through the host's innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectin receptors, TLR receptors, NOD-like receptors, and RIG-I-like receptors (RLR).
Through various routes, the virus reveals the causes of infection, the development of dendritic cells, and the creation of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate macrophages of viral antibodies.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV helps the virus escape from an immune response.
Soon, the adaptive immune response will be a battleground for the virus.
T lymphocytes including CD4+ CD8+ T cells play an important role in the defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies and CD8+ T cells directly kill infected cells with the virus.
T-supplier cells produce pre-infection cytokines to help immune cells.
In addition, coronavirus can inhibit T-cell functions by killing T-cells.
The liquefied immunity, including complements such as C3a, C5a, and antibodies, is also necessary to combat viral infection.
For example, antibodies taken from recovered patients inhibit MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system generates a large amount of free radicals locally that can cause severe damage to lungs and other organs, and, in the worst scenario, lead to multiple organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which develops in constipation, is more likely to occur in elderly people and pregnant women.
In general, people who are exposed to many viruses or whose immune functions are at higher risk have a higher chance of being infected than others.
According to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan, the estimated exposure time for SARS-CoV-2 was 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days.
At the same time, a study on 1,099 infected people showed that the average incubation period was 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
Recent studies, as described above, indicate that the incubation period was 4.8 (7.2-3.0) days, according to a demographic of 8,866 patients.
It is very important for health authorities to determine effective quarantine time according to the most accurate incubation period, thus preventing the virus from transmitting from asymptomatic infected people to others.
As a common practice, people who have been infected or have been infected with other patients are often required to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
It is usually the main and initial symptom of COVID-19 that can be associated with alone or with other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, nasal discharge, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients developed hypoglycemia and hypoxemia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the disease rapidly develops as a result of respiratory distress, decompression of the blood and organs, metabolic acidity, and blood disease.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and high fever, even if their lung radiography is not abnormal, should be tested for early detection of the virus.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 showed that 98% of patients had fever, 76% or cough, 55% or shortness of breath, 3% or diarrhea, and 8% needed respiratory support.
Two recent studies of a family cluster and a cluster of transmission from an asymptomatic individual showed similar results.
Comparatively, a demographic survey in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and parasites (55%).
However, 80% of these patients were in need of respiratory therapy, much more frequently than COVID-19 patients and consistent with the higher MERS mortality rate than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it was found that up to (100%-99%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (42%-40%), diarrhea (25%-20%), and sore throat (13-25%) were the main symptoms, and about 20-14% of the patients needed to breathe.
As of February 14, the death toll from COVID-19 was 2%, while the confirmed case fatality was 66,576 worldwide.
Comparatively, the death rate from SARS as of November 2002 was 10% of 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographic study in June 2012, the mortality was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
An earlier study showed that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 6.47, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 7.23-5.71, while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV is given by their symptoms, mortality, and R0, in Table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but less deadly than the other two.
Thus, it is much more difficult to control the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 than both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Symptoms often start in the same family or the same gathering or device, like a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or stay in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected individuals or patients in the last two weeks prior to the onset of the disease.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus asymptomatically for more than two weeks, and recovered patients discharged from the hospital can carry the virus again, which also triggers an alarm to extend the quarantine period.
Patients have normal or decreased number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, lymphopenia with a white blood cell line <4x109/L containing lymphocyte count <1x109/L and elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels and viremia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Levels of muscle, liver, and myoglobin enzymes were observed to increase in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and sedimentation of red blood cells were elevated in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, levels of D-dimer, a fibrous degenerative product present in the blood, increased and levels of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
Abnormalities in chest radiography have been observed in most COVID-19 patients and are present in the lungs as a butterfly shadow on either side or a dark patch of glass.
Patients often exhibit atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled infection, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis put the gas exchange at risk.
The dysfunction of type 1 and type 2 penicillin decreases the surfactant level and increases the elasticity of the material, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to expand, and increasing the risk of lung insufficiency.
So, the worse the chest radiation from the patient is so much more virulent than the disease itself.
On February 18, 2020, the first pharmacological analysis of COVID-19 revealed that the killing of neomyosites, the creation of the healin membrane, and the lymphatic fusion of intercellular lymphocytes, and the nucleus havoc cells in the lungs of patients who died of the virus and were associated with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as an important measure for the detection of COVID-19.
However, due to the rise in malnutrition rates, which may accelerate the epidemic, clinical signs were used to diagnose the disease in China on February 13, 2020 (since it was no longer dependent on RT-PCR).
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of the disease’s precursors, symptoms, laboratory tests, and sensory findings is necessary for an effective diagnosis and procedure to be achieved.
On 14 February 2020, Feng Zhang Group described a protocol using the SHERLOCK technique or CRISPR-based for the detection of SARS-CoV-2-CoV substitution, requiring RNA substitution of 20x10-18mol/L to less than 200x10-18mol/L.
Hopefully, this new technology, if confirmed, could dramatically increase the sensitivity and simplicity of clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the novel coronavirus, doctors can generally provide care for COVID-19 patients, with treatment that has previously been used for other coronavirus patients such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viruses that have been used to treat them.
These therapies include current antiviral drugs used and potential drugs, immune system boosters, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese drugs, and psychological support.
Even plasma from recovered patients had been suggested to be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are currently racing to develop antibodies and vaccines for the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the respiratory system and may also attack, to a lesser extent, organs that contain ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.
In addition, dysfunction and respiratory failure are a major threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Hence, respiratory support is critical to alleviate symptoms and save lives, including general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen therapy, noninvasive ventilation, aggressive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity and severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be given extra membrane oxygenation (ECMO), an improved technique for heart attack and respiratory failure to treat dangerous respiratory or heart failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infection and septic shock, as well as the protection of the functions of the essential organs are important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It has been shown that the cytokine storm is the result of an overreaction of the immune system of SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storm is a type of systemic inflammatory response triggered by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3> and MCP-1.
These cytokines force immune cells to release many free radicals, which is the main cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunodeficiency inhibitors to treat cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumabs, and an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storms.
Other immunosuppression solutions for treating cytokine storms include the stimulation of the immune response to T-cells; IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1, and TNF cell blockage; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; cytokine signaling suppressor4; and HDAC inhibitor.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, are widely used to treat SARS in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Additionally, steroids taken in large doses are not useful for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, it can cause severe side effects, especially neural osteoporosis, which significantly affect the diagnosis of the disease.
In addition, short-term corticosteroids from low to moderate doses have been recommended to be used for patients with undiagnosed COVID-19.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral treatment has been confirmed.
However, intravenous injection of remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, has been shown to have an effect in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Malburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also demonstrated its ability to inhibit single-stranded RNA viruses, including SARS and MERS viruses.
Based on these, Gilead transferred the compound to China to test SARS-CoV-2 infected people, and the results were highly anticipated.
In addition, barcitinb, interferon-alpha, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin, have been suggested as potential drugs for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other harmful reactions may occur after using combined lopinavir/ritonavir therapy.
The interactions of these treatments with other drugs in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovered patients and antibody generation
The collection of the blood from patients who have recovered from a pandemic and its use to treat patients suffering from the same disease or to protect individual health is much longer in the process of catching the disease.
In fact, recovered patients often have a very high level of antibodies to fight off the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (LG) produced by <0xCE><0xB2>-cell lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other external targets and detect unique molecules in the pathogen and neutralize it directly.
Thus, plasma from the blood group of patients recovered from COVID-19 has been leased into 10 intensively infected patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, as well as their inflammation and viral status decreased and oxygen saturation improved in their blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary to suggest a method for large-scale use before the development of specific therapies.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some disadvantages associated with the plasma should be considered carefully.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which can lead to a life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is typically low, and the demand for plasma is high to treat patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce special antibodies fast enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is critical and viable to isolate B-cells from recovered patients and find their genetic codes and encoding effective antibodies, or screen for effective antibodies to the virus protein.
If this is possible, we can very easily increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used for thousands of years to treat various diseases in China.
However, its effects largely depend on a combination of several components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis of the disease based on TCM theories.
Most of the effective ingredients remain unknown or vague because it is difficult to extract and verify such compounds or their proper combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific therapies for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative therapies for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from a more severe phase of the disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest rate of treatment for COVID-19 patients has been seen in several provinces in China, with 87% of patients receiving TCM, including in Gansu (63.7%), in Ningxia (50%), and in Hunan (50%), while in TCM province, only 30% of COVID-19 patients had lower rates and recovered.
However, this is a fairly small comparison, since many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should be considered in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli ZHang and colleagues published a study comparing Western Medicine (WM) treatment alone.
They found that the time needed to recover body temperature, loss of symptoms, and need to fall asleep in the hospital within the WM+TCM group were significantly lower than in the WM alone group.
More significantly, the rate of worsening symptoms (lightly to severe) is lower than in the WM+TCM group (7.4% versus 46.2%) and the death rate in the WM+TCM group is lower than in the WM only group (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of TCM still await more well-controlled trials at a larger scale and in more centers.
It will also be interesting to describe the mechanism of action and to explain the effective components of TCM therapy or its components if possible.
Patients who are suspected to have COVID-19 or have been confirmed to have underlying conditions often experience high fears of a lethal disease or pandemic, and quarantined people also experience boredom, isolation, and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, and cough, and side effects of drugs such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can lead to anxiety and mental distress.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a range of psychiatric conditions including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychological stimuli, symptoms of insanity, vomiting, and even suicide were reported.
Regular contact tracing and quarantine, as part of the public health response to COVID-19, can make people more concerned and guilty about the effects of the pandemic, quarantine, and the abuse on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected individuals and those in contact with them as well as to the general public.
Psychologic support should be included, the creation of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular updates and detailed outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2, treatment plans and the use of electronic devices and profiles to prevent close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are required to interrupt transmission sequences from animals and infected humans to zoonotic hosts and are often complementary to antiviral therapy to control epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop a S-type protein-based vaccine to produce long-term neutralizing and/or protective antibodies against the SARS-CoV virus.
Live vulnerabilized vaccines for SARS have been evaluated in animal models.
However, the in vivo efficacy of this vaccine candidate in elderly individuals and lethal-fighting models and their protection against the spread of a shared virus between humans and animals have not yet been determined before clinical trials can begin.
This is probably because SARS came down 17 years ago and since then no cases have been reported.
In contrast, cases and outbreaks of MERS still occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the persistence of human and animal sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed through the use of inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanomolecules, virus-like molecules, and sub-protein recombinant substrates, and some have been evaluated in animals.
Creating safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 viruses for vulnerable individuals is a very urgent and important task to control the current pandemic.
However, overcoming this problem is particularly daunting due to the length of time it takes to develop a vaccine (about 18 months) and the dynamic variation of CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to show its clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover progressively without procrastination.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 also brings with it high morbidity and death in severe cases.
Therefore, building a model of disease prognosis for the disease is necessary for health care agencies to prioritize their services, especially in resource-constrained areas.
According to clinical studies that have been reported so far, the following factors may be affected or related to the prediction of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age is the most important factor for the recovery period in SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurred over the age of 30-65 and in a study involving 8,866 people, 47.7% of the patients were over 50 years old as described above.
Patients who sought medical attention were more likely to have other diseases and were significantly older than those who did not (at the age of 66 versus 51), suggesting age as a predictive factor for the outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 affects more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Other illness: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to have acute heart disease or arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which may cause liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It's worth noting that age and underlying disease are strongly correlated and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood indicates severity of infection or tissue damage and is a potential predictor of disease, response to medication, and end-recovery.
The relationship between CRP levels to the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been suggested.
In addition, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may help predict the results.
These enzymes are widespread in many organs, especially in the heart and stomach, and are released during tissue damage.
So these are common markers of heart and liver disorders.
Major clinical symptoms: For the prediction of outcomes and complexity of COVID-19, chest radiation and temporary improvement of clinical symptoms should be considered along with other issues.
Use of steroids: As mentioned earlier, steroids are immune boosters and are often used as an adjunct treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of infection damage.
Since a large dose of corticosteroids was widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors experienced bone cell death and anaesthesia with disability and life expectancy deterioration.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low-dose and briefly in COVID-19 patients.
Stress: As mentioned earlier, at the time of the COVID-19 outbreak many patients experience extraordinary anxiety as they often experience periods of long-term quarantine and extreme uncertainty outside and have witnessed the death of family members and friends.
It is imperative to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help these patients overcome the stress and return to normal life.
Based on studies conducted so far, COVID-19 has different transmission patterns compared to SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory system, SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory system and show mild or no symptoms in the early stages of infection, similar to other coronaviruses that cause a common cold.
So infected patients at an early stage or during an absence of the disease can produce a large amount of virus during day-to-day activities, which can cause great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, the SARS-CoV virus was transmitted when the infected patient was stable, while most transmission did not occur in the initial stage.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more difficult to control than the SARS epidemic.
Currently, efforts are underway in China in the hopes of interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, including the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and continuous quarantine of almost all the population.
Although these actions have significantly damaged the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of newly infected patients is decreasing, indicating the slowing of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the deceleration phase will last for 3-4 months.
Despite this, some experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter and his colleagues estimate that COVID-19, which appears to be far more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and her colleagues developed a model for predicting the outcome of the pandemic, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the two central turbinate and throat swabs of patients who had recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks earlier, indicating that the newly identified virus could be a cyclical occurrence such as influenza.
However, given the declining number of new infections, promising signs have occurred in China, indicating that current strategies may be effective.
Ebola was initially estimated to cause up to one million infections and half a million deaths.
However, with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease is eventually under control.
It is possible, as with SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 may become less susceptible to infection and eventually disappear or become a less pathogenic virus and stay with humans.
A comparison of the epidemic of COVID-19 with SARS and MERS is provided below (Fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmitted through coughing or sneezing, and possibly through direct contact with substances contaminated with the virus.
The virus has also been found in feces, which raises a new possibility of feces-to-mouth transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases showed that 41% of cases may have been infected in hospitals, with 17 patients with previous illnesses and 40 of them being healthcare workers.
Therefore, great precautions need to be taken to protect humans, especially healthcare workers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even visitors who have been in contact with patients and infected people.
The first line of defense that could be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of face masks; using both surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (series number 1860) can help control the spread of viruses.
Surgery face masks prevent droplets from a potentially infected person from moving through the air or interlacing with surfaces of objects where they can be passed on to others.
However, only the N95 mask (series numbered 1860) can protect against the inhalation of small viruses ranging from 10 to 80 nanometers, and only 5% of the viruses can be fully spread; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and is approximately 85 nanometers.
Since molecules can spread even if five surgical masks are attached to one another, healthcare providers with direct contact with patients should wear N95 masks (series numbered 1860) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health-care workers should wear appropriate isolation clothing in order to be less exposed to viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
In January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 although he wore an N95 mask; the virus may have penetrated through his eye infection.
Health care workers should therefore wear transparent face shields or glasses while working with patients.
In general infected areas, it is recommended that everyone wash their hands with antiviral soap more often than usual, stay at home for self-quarantine and limit contact with potentially infected people.
Three feet is a good distance to stay away from a patient.
These are active and effective measures to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came to people around the world as a new virus, there are many similarities to the SARS-CoV described on 7 January 2020 should have been a major cause of the changes in China based on the deep knowledge of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, until January 19, 2020, the central administration of Wuhan’s disease eradication did not relieve its citizens by saying that the virus is slow spreading and limited in incidence from human to human, and not a problem in preventing and preventing the disease.
This message sustained intensely public panic, especially when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the time was also wasted for bravery to control and contain the disease at its lowest level in Wuhan.
Patient control agencies and institutions in China may take this lesson and make improvements in the future.
For example, organizations and institutions should (1) be more vigilant when they publish a public declaration, because any words for their collaborators can change their decision-making and behavior; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to non-essential information; and (3) be more responsive to non-essential practices, as opposed to expecting more formal medical and administrative reports; (3) be more stringent in terms of limiting and controlling practices.
The outbreak of coronavirus-19 is the result of a new virus called SARS-CoV-2, which began in December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread across China and nearly 50 countries around the world at the time of writing this.
Because the virus is similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar between SARS-CoV and SARS, the spread of the coronavirus has made it possible to feel that SARS reappears.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are major differences in the prevention and treatment of the epidemic.
COVID-19 affects more elderly people than young people, as well as more men than women, and the severity and death rate are higher in older people than in younger people.
(SARS is 19.91% less active than COVID-19 compared to 1.44 percent.)
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they are symptomatic, while SARS patients are equally susceptible when they are severely ill, which causes much larger problems to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains in part why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV-2.
The normal RNA test for SARS-CoV can be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, cured patients can contract the virus again.
These findings also increase the risk of spreading the virus surprisingly.
With such rapid advances in the study of COVID-19, some critical problems remain to be solved, such as:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of the genome is shared between SARS-CoV-2 and bat-like coronaviruses, we cannot say that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
What animal was the intermediate animal to transmit the virus from the original host, saying it was bats to humans?
Without answering questions <0x23>1 and <0x23>2, we cannot effectively deter the transmission, and the outbreak can reappear at any time.
Although molecular mercury and synthetic tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how does the virus specifically enter the airborne cells and subsequently cause disease-related changes?
Does the virus also interact with ACE2-related cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we can't get a quick, precise diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus genetically increase genes when they're transmitted between humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, will it die like SARS, or will it resurface periodically like the flu?
It is important and may take time to search for the answers to the above and many other questions.
However, regardless of the desired response, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic anytime soon and bring our lives back to normal.
Zoonotic origins of human HCoVs
Mutation has steered the evolution of coronaviruses and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two human coronaviruses were known to cause simple diseases, such as common cold and cold.
The spread of severe symptoms of respiratory distress, known as SARS, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome, known as MERS, has been the result of a disease that has shown how devastating and life-threatening an HCoV infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 re-emerged the coronavirus and raised eyebrows with its high transmissibility, but reduced pathogenicity compared to cervical SARS-CoV.
HCoVs are transmitted from animals to humans, and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs could be beneficial.
Most HCoVs have emerged from bats, while they are not pathogenic.
Moderate HCoV hosts are known.
The selection of animal hosts directly contributes to the prevention of human diseases.
Studying animal reservoir exposures of CoVs may give us important insights into CoVs from pathogens in humans.
In this analysis, we present a discussion of the existing knowledge on the seven types of CoVs, focusing on the history of their discovery as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission.
Importantly, we compare and measure different types of HCoVs from the point of view of virus evolution and genetic recombination.
The current coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) disease is described in this context.
In addition, the needs of successful hosts vary and the viral evolutionary coefficient of disease severity is also assessed.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which is a group of single-stranded and positively convergent RNA viruses.
These viruses enter the largest genomes of 26 to 32 kilobases between RNA viruses called "CoVs" because of their crown-like shape under microscopes.
Essentially, CoVs have non-segmented genomes that share a similar pathway.
Approximately two-thirds of the genomes contain two large open frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated as pp1a and pp1ab multi-enzyme proteins.
Variant proteins mostly use 16-baseless proteins, classified as nsp1<0x7E>16.
The remainder of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, which include acute (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of conjugated subspecies proteins have been modified by different strains of CoVs.
Based on different protein sequences, CoVs are divided into 4 types, alpha-CoVs, beta-CoVs, gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs. Among them, beta-CoVs, and delta-CoVs, the most common are CoVs.
Multispecies evidence has shown that bats and rodents are the genetic source of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main source of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have consistently transcended the barriers between species and have evolved to be highly infectious to humans.
To date, seven human HCoVs are known.
Among them were HCoV-229E and HCoV2NL63 alpha-CoVs.
Other 5 beta-coronaviruses include: HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-Symptom Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 generally cause mild symptoms, such as common colds and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing acute respiratory distress in many patients with an increased likelihood of causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pneumonia outbreaks.
The first HCoV-229E severe infection, B814, was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more information has been gathered through intensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause short-term symptoms.
Of course, it was widely accepted that coronavirus infection was generally harmless until the outbreak of SARS.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 is one of the most devastating in history, infecting more than 8,000 people, with a death rate of nearly 10 percent.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak of MERS caused a resilient epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread around the world.
The 2019 coronavirus, (2019-nCoV), which was subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the source of the ongoing epidemic of the 2019 COVID-19 coronavirus, which has killed 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The bell is ringing and the world must prepare for the future pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.
All seven species of HCoVs have a zoonotic origin in bats, mice or domestic animals.
Multiple evidence supports the evolutionary origin of all types of bat HCoVs, where viruses adapt well and are not pathogenic, but have large genetic variations.
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought huge medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges to China and the world.
Following the zoonotic origins of HCoVs, we have a framework for understanding the history of nature, management power and potential factors for species jumping.
This may be a guide or facilitator for hosts, intermediate and enhancers of SARS-CoV-2, with important contributions to preventing future spread.
In this analysis, we present a discussion of zoonotic origins, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of HCoVs.
Specifically, we identify and discuss the generic form of HCoVs, which is itself not pathogenic in its natural host, but becomes pathogenic after being transmitted to a new host.
We also talk about the evolution of HCoVs, with increased transmissibility, usually associated with lower pathogenic rates.
The outcome of the ongoing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is also described in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the isolation of B814 HCoV-229E from the respiratory tract of patients with common cold, different CoVs were isolated from various strains, including camels, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
In the past century, seven types of coronaviruses have been identified.
A summary of the history of CoV detection in human order (Table 1) will contain information and guidance.
The first HCoV-229E infection was isolated from respiratory tract infection in patients with respiratory tract infection in 1966, followed by growth in WI-38 lung cells.
Infected people with HCoV-229E exhibited common cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, fatigue, and sore throat, with fever and cough seen in 10<0x7E>20% of infected people.
Later in 1967, HCOV-OC43 was isolated from the lining and pattern of brain passage in mammalian mice.
The signs and symptoms of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which are symptomatically indistinguishable from respiratory tract infections such as influenza A and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed globally, being the first to be transmitted during the winter season in a cold climate.
Overall, the life cycle of these viruses is less than one week, followed by about two weeks of illness.
According to a study by volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed mild cold.
Only a few patients with weakened immunity can develop a severe respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as "anonymous pneumonia," was first well documented as being the source of the epidemic in human history, and SARS-CoV was also the infectious factor, the third HCoV discovered.
The first known case of SARS dates back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 cases with 774 fatalities spreading across several countries and continents.
In addition to its rapid spread, it was estimated that each case would increase in two secondary cases with a life cycle of 4 to 7 days and the maximum viral load on the 10th day of the disease would be found.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially exhibit muscle soreness, headache, fever, haemorrhage, and coldness, followed by respiratory distress and respiratory distress as the last symptoms.
Lymphopenia, patients diagnosed with liver function tests and elevated nitrogen in urea, are common laboratory abnormalities for SARS.
Symptoms of lung pain, inflammatory cells spread and increased macrophages are also associated in SARS patients.
Approximately 20% to 30% of patients will then require intensive care and artificial respiration.
In addition to the lower respiratory system, several organs, including the digestive system, liver and kidneys, can experience severe conditions that often include cytokine storms that may cause death in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from the open lung test of a relative of a patient who had visited Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, significant effort has been spent on HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a seven-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to be prevalent in young children and patients with weakened immune systems and respiratory diseases.
The occurrence of corysa and pink eye blinking and bronchiolitis are common causes of HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nose sample of an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it has actually spread to the world.
HCoV-NL63 is estimated to account for about 4.7% of respiratory illnesses, with peak events in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with blockages in the throat, also known as blockages.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchitis in Hong Kong.
Despite community-acquired pneumonia and bronchitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been found to be associated with severe pneumonia.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found throughout the world, causing pneumonia and pneumonia.
The four types of HCoVs received by the community have been well-received by humans and are essentially less likely to be altered and become a major cause of disease, although incidents caused by unknown causes have been reported in several rare cases of HCoV-NL63 strains.
Generally, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to transmit and heal within humans, they are also less virulent or pathogenic.
MERs-CoV was first isolated in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and pneumonia.
While most of the laboratory-confirmed cases are from the Middle East, cases with cases with mortality have been reported due to close contacts in many European countries and Tunisia.
Another outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
Clinical manifestations of MERS similar to SARS are distinguished by the development of acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also suffer from severe renal failure, which separates MERS from HCoV disease.
More than 30% of patients show gastrointestinal symptoms, including vomiting and vomiting.
On February 14, 2020, there were more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses known to humanity.
In mid-December 2019, a series of pneumonia diseases emerged due to SARS-CoV-2 infection that were tested in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) says the SARS-CoV-2 spike in pneumonia is also a global health emergency, known as COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with an estimated 3.4 deaths.
In fact, the case fatality rate in Hubei, China is 4.2%, while the outside rate is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causes severe pneumonia, including fever, cough and respiratory failure.
Some patients develop aneurysm.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can develop rapidly and be akin to respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are closely related due to the high sequence homology of 82%, they come together in different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be less pathogenic but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic according to the reports of SARS-CoV-2 infection and may contribute to its rapid spread around the world.
Comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six CoVs, similarities and differences appear to be of interest.
First, the life cycle and the duration of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the public navigation of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severe symptoms of COVID-19 lie between SARS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs (example: HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals exhibit characteristics that are more commonly seen during infection with HCoVs, including the presence of unique, moderate, and even symptomatic symptoms.
On the other hand, a small group of cases of COVID-19 can be seen in patients with SARS-CoV, although the figure is slightly lower.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 illustrates the striking features of both community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoV.
On the other hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is higher than the rate of community-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, it remains to be determined whether the rate of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after human transmission as in cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, the same as HCoVs and SARS-CoV-2 can be found in fecal samples.
Whether saliva transmission of SARS-CoV plays an important role in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances, remains to be seen in future studies.
It is also worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 can occur in seasons as in cases of community-acquired HCoVs.
The characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, which have the potential for transmission, spread and continuity of infection after infection in humans, will be influential on the final resolution of the current outbreak of COVID-19.
The four community-acquired HCoVs are responsible for producing mild symptoms that humans have successfully adapted to.
On the other hand, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
Alternatively, we can say that both survived the ancient HCoV epidemic.
HCoVs that cause disease in humans and people who have developed HCoVs have been eliminated.
In order for this to happen, HCoVs must replicate in humans to sufficiently scale to allow the capacity to accommodate mutations that elicit host inhibition factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts, the more likely it is to infect humans in order to fully adapt to humans.
It's possible to adapt well to human transmission simply because there's a quarantine or other controlling agencies that are infected.
For many years, the four community-acquired CoVs cause common cold to be passed on to populations.
These viruses don't need an animal store.
Conversely, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, on the other hand, have not adapted to humans well and their transmission to humans is not sustainable.
They need to maintain and spread in their biodiversity stores as well as seek for outbreaks to reach human targets, possibly through a more or less intermediate and amplifying hosts.
The features of SARS-CoV-2 are similar to both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.
It is highly transmissible like community-acquired HCoVs, at least for the time being.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to humans and spread within humans without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the biological source of HCoVs, it is best to talk about the definitions and characteristics of the developing, natural, intermediate and amplifying host of HCoVs.
An animal is the growth host of HCoVs if it invades a closely related species and then exchanges homologation at the level of nucleotide sequence.
The ancestor of the virus is always well adapted and not transmissible to that host.
In addition, reservoir reservoirs protect the host against HCoVs continuously and over a long period of time.
In both cases, hosts are naturally infected and natural hosts to HCoVs or to the parent of the virus.
In contrast, if HCoV is newly introduced to the host interface before or shortly after its introduction to humans, it is not well adapted to the new host and is a pathogen.
This intermediate host can serve as an intermediate source of habitat for human infection and plays a role in enlarging the host by allowing the virus to replicate within a short period of time and then transmitting it to humans to magnify the extent of human infection.
HCoVs can pass through a closed infection if they are not able to carry a transport jet within the intermediate host.
Conversely, HCoVs can also adapt to their intermediate hosts, even allowing them to accommodate themselves long-term.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir reservoir.
Infectious data suggests a downward trend in the case of SARS has something to do with biological history.
A study of the number of cases indicates that the animal exchanger anti-sash CoV lgG was more prevalent than it is among the general population.
Mask cats on palm trees (Paguma Larvata) and raccoon dogs in live animal markets were first identified to carry SARS-CoV-like viruses that are nearly identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that there was no confirmed case of SARS after killing all the pets in the markets.
However, it has been revealed that Pagomela larvae are wild or wild cats from farms that have no contact with farm animals that are more likely to be negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that Pagomela larvae cats can only enlarge the host but not the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It's remarkable because 80% of the various animals in the markets of Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, if there is any possibility that a variety of small mammals may serve as intermediates to increase the host of SARS-CoV.
All of these seem to be the end-users of SARS-CoV.
What distinguishes the research is that the reliance on the natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV-related bat-CoVs, the relative name of SARS, is from the genome of the genus RNA-CoV HKU3 (SARSr-RH-BatCoV HKU3) that exists in each bat.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-RH-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
This and other bat CoVs share 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies have unveiled a new idea that suggests bat hosts cause human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have been detected in bats, but only one known as WIV1 can be isolated as a living virus.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be the receptor for SARS coronavirus.
WIV1 was extracted from the fecal samples of bats that showed that bat ACE2 and pagoma larvata and human cats used as receptors to enter the cell.
What's most interesting is that SARS-assimiated serums have been able to invalidate WIV1's work.
Thus, WIV1 represents the closest pre-coronavirus SARS linkage in bats, spreading as much as 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
However, high homology of these two viruses, generally associated with the belief that WIV1 is not the immediate parent of the SARS-CoV virus and that bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
Genetic analysis of MERS-CoV groups for the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV take advantage of the same host receptor, DPP4, to enter the virus.
Autonomous RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV are biologically closer than those of bats found in Europe and Africa.
So far, no SARS-CoV can be detected in wild bats.
Mars-CoVs and similar CoVs associated with CoV-HKU25 share only 87% of the nucleotide sequence.
However, bats may not be a fast-acting host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that camels have single-celled viral antibodies to Mars-CoV, similar to camels in the Middle East, usually from several African regions.
The identity of VIRC Mass-CoV was discovered but separated from the dromedary camels caught in respiratory arrest, further revealing that dromedary camels serve as one host for SARS-CoV.
It is also noted that the symptoms are generally mild but that the extreme spread of the virus has been observed in camels infected with MERS-CoV.
Notably, infected camels transmit the virus not only through respiratory tract but also through fecal-oral route, which is the same route of virus spread to bats as well.
However, tracers are still missing since many cases of Mars have been reported and no contact has been made with camels who have previously had symptoms, likely a source of human-to-human transmission or the paths of unknown small animals containing MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with the bat COV-RaTG13 isolated from the rhinolophus fusion bat.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the pattern of differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is great for family relationships.
That is to say, bats may not be immediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 until known bats are found in the future.
It is thought that, in the advanced stage, animal hosts for SARS-CoV-2 would be among the wild animal species sold or killed in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, with the early cases of COVID-19 confined to a possible animal-to-human transmission phenomenon.
Some of the lower-level studies on the regulation of metabolic linkages have suggested that there is a group of underwater mammals known as pangolins (Menis javanica) that can also be close to the zoonotic that is related to SARS-CoV-2.
The CoV genes of these new pangolins combine 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally related to RATG13 to 90% known at the level of nucleotide sequence.
They provide two-line age pairs to both SARS-CoV-2 as a virus in the kinidae tree, one of which shares the most binding receptor (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2, with 97% amino acid identification.
In stark contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are quite different, although there is a higher rate of genome-equivalent spread.
A previous study of pangolins disease also suggested that they may have been infected with viral DNA fragments from lung samples, which appeared to be related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study includes different subfields and a personalized awareness to the creation of a genomic sequence containing about 86.3% of the entire viral genome.
We cannot rule out that pangolin is one of the preferred hosts of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
However, there is no evidence as to where the first source of pangolin SARS-CoV-2 came from, despite the incubation of SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2 hominids.
However, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is less than between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-like COVID-19.
The development of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammalian species is currently being studied.
Considering the highest serial homology ever found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolins, SARS-CoV-2 is related to beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, the distribution of the highest genome-square sequence homology.
It is widely believed that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs (SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2) is determined by selectivity-uniform evolution.
In contrast to the demand for a combination between pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As a force of evolution, correlation is extremely prevalent among beta-CoVs.
The evaluative team is still out of the Xenotic region of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the high-frequency pathogen pathogens of HCoVs, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229, HCO43, HC0V-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 have also been tested.
Historical evolutionary evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCOv-229E originated in bat CoVs, when the family virus HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in reefs.
It has been reported that bat CoV called ARCoV.2 (the CoV barrier program) has been found in North America and is found to be in bat-shaped, closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCo-229E was genetically related to another bat CoV, titled Hipposidors/Household/19/2008.[3][4] Vaccinations of camels were found in Ghana during this period were suspected as intermediate hosts.[4]
To be clear, the latest knowledge on animal origins known as HCoV is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Analysis of evolutionary history has been attributed to interspecies transmission events of HCoVs in history.
When HCO-OC43 crossed species to infect humans by households around 1890, a respiratory disease was recorded.
The history of HCoV-229E airborne transmission is less clear
Bat alpha-CoVs are closely related to HCO-229E which have been found.
Among them, there's an alpaca alpaca co-op.
Some evidence-based vaccines directly support human-to-human transmission from bats.
First, humans, not alpacas (a kind of bear-like animal, but slightly larger) may have been exposed to bats in some kind of interoperable environment.
Instead, humans have close ties to alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E-associated bat CoVs are very different from non-compliant bat alpha-CoVs, while alpha-CoVs cause the spread of respiratory illness in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoVs have not been found in poached animals.
Therefore, the possibility that alpacas reach HCoV-299E related alpha-coronavirus from humans could not be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human disease-causing viruses such as rabies virus, Ebola virus, Napa virus, and Hendra virus.
So it is not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
On the other hand, while bat alpha-CoVs act as a gene pool of HCoV-299E, alpacas and dromedary camels can act as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, similar to in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-KOV serves as the best example of transmission in interspecies, from bats to dromedary camels and from dromedary camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known at the time of identification and has also been strengthened by subsequent findings.
It is clear that bats have a rich pool of virus species for interspecies replacement of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, colonization of the nucleus, close cohabitation of the strong ability to fly, all of which are suitable for bats to become a "virus spreader".
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced to dromedary camels for decades.
It is well adapted to these camels that have evolved from a intermediate host to a stable and natural host storage.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a low rate of DNA change in these animals.
Peer-to-peer transmission is an event, and humans eventually become a dead host host of MERS-CoV, when transmission cannot be sustained.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if anything, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was different.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly deficient in pangolins.
They could eventually be a dead-end host of SARS-CoV-related beta-CoVs, similar to civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
A number of possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans need to be ruled out or discovered in future studies.
First, bats can be a host of SARS-CoV-2-related viruses that are very similar to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may share the ecological diversity with bats through meat-selling or coal-fired fields.
Second, pangolins can be an enlarged host cell from when SARS-CoV-2-related viruses were newly identified.
Humans contract the virus through meat-eating and poaching.
Many mammals, especially pets, may have been susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Testing for domestic and wild animals for antibodies suggests a solution.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has had contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the original animals of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
Apart from various animal hosts, there are three main factors in the virus that are also important to facilitate crossing species boundaries.
First of all, high RNA replication rates.
Compared to other single-stage RNA viruses, the estimated CoV crossovers can be viewed as "intermediate" to "high" with an average substitution rate - 10-4 substitutions per year per site 2.
CoVs have evidence--reading oxoribonuclease (RNA tape anesthesia), deleting any of the results is highly variable and potentially weakening or even not working.
Specifically, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir is known to suppress CoV replication by inhibiting the entry of the outer nucleus and RNA-dependent and RNA-dependent enzymes.
Remdesivir is one of the antiviral agents for SARS-CoV-2 to be tested in clinical trials.
However, mutation rates from CoVs are almost a million times higher than their hosts.
In addition, mutation rates are often higher when CoVs are not well adapted to hosts.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, SARS-CoV-2 has a clearly lower mutation rate, suggesting a higher adaptation rate.
Presumably, it has corresponded to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well suited to 1-copate camels.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that the slow movement of genetics would lead to the development of vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffectively.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoVs exerts more adaptability to the genome for mutation and recombination, further enabling the possibility for co-evolution, which is advantageous for fusion of new CoVs when conditions improve.
This is supported by a unique, cross-sectional reading of proteins and how proteins work on coding to the third end of the genome.
Third, CoVs randomly and continuously change their shells as RNA divides into a specific "copy-choice" mechanism.
In a host that serves as the mixing pan, mutations in CoV RNA often occur in the spine.
Highly homologous full-length and subgenomic RNAs may regroup to create new CoVs.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, such as animal CoVs such as SL-COV bats and COV-HKU9 bats.
The host-virus synthesis in their communications.
With these three factors of viral zoonotic origin described above, a confluence of the virus through a host valve is another factor affecting their spread among species.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which has also shown evidence for positive selection during the transmission process.
Considering the comparative analysis between human isolation and SARS-CoV civetization, SARS-CoV is thought to undergo rapid adaptive testing in different hosts, especially with mutations in the RBD of the S protein.
Generally, the RBD in the S protein of a CoV interacts with the cellular receptor and is particularly selective by host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, the RBD on 318 to 510 amino acids on the slice of S1, which binds to human ACE2 as a source for virus entry.
The RBD of SARS-CoV can identify the ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bats, civets, rodents, and raccoons, allowing interspecies transmission of viruses.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues have been thought to be different from human and civet viral isolates from RBD and 4 of them are fixed on a receptor-binding receptor for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Civet SARS-CoV has a mutation in K479N and S487T RBD, which may increase the adaptation of the action of spike protein with human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, the substitution of these two amino acids might be critical for virus adaption to humans.
It is believed that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
Thirty percent of the difference between SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV-1 shares in the S1 unit of protein S that may have altered the coherence of the S protein to human ACE2.
Indeed, a cryo-EM study found that this correlation approximates 10 to 20 times higher than that in human ACE2 and S ARS-KOVS proteins.
It will also be specific to whether any receivers will be needed for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Oddly enough, NL63 also combines with ACE2 but with a different part of S.
There are other HCoV receptors, such as the aminopeptide N enzyme for HCoV-229E, and 9-O sialic acetate additive for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for successful adaptation of CoVs in humans after interspecies transmission from their own animals.
In addition to host receptors, the results of interspecies transmission of CoVs are also governed by other host factors, such as independent and selective hosts.
The spread of host proteins between humans and the natural host of CoVs such as bats, camels and rodents may constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
Coronaviruses had to invade host dependency factors and eliminate host restriction factors, in order to successfully transmit between hosts.
In this regard, chemical defenses in this important area, where the virus has interactivity, have been identified and described.
An expanded and unbiased genome model of host-independent and restrictive factors for SARS-CoV-2 using a genetically engineered CRISPR technology may be fruitful.
Combined viral CoVs: Back to the starting point
The diversity and diversity of bat CoVs provides a better opportunity for the inclusion of HCoVs.
Accordingly, bat CoVs do the same thing as CoVs.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombination also control the development of coronaviruses and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of proteolytic cells has the potential to profoundly alter epithelial infections.
Among SARS-CoV-2-proteins, ORF8 is thought to be important in adaptation to humans, with bat viruses related to SARS-CoV being isolated, but it turns out that ORF-8 is synthesized into ORF8 proteins.
The 29-nucleotide disappearance property of SARS-CoV, at the beginning of the epidemic, was found in isolated specimens.
This deletion divides the ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be a change that improves host exchange.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history with alpha and gamma CoVs, with a larger number of recombinant regions in RNA-associated RNA polymerase.
Configuration locations were also identified in nsp9, most nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic experienced sequences at different intervals, which occurred in camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, similar arrangements have also been observed in CoVs, where CoVs have been synchronized with other animals in the unspecified genome of CoVs.
It should be cautioned that artificial detection can cause undesired and widespread mutations, which are more likely to result in the spread of the virus from a detected area of compression, such as the body's immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of the full ORF4 CoV-229E primary, leading to a 2-nucleotide deletion.
While impotent ORF4 can be observed in bats and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, the alpha-CoV envelope displays a single nucleotide repellent, resulting in a replication.
Last but not least, the evolution of HCoVs is also guided by its hosts’ diagnosis.
The lack of symptoms, or the presence of simple and weak symptoms, were diagnosed when bats were infected with coronavirus, indicating the transition between CoVs and bats.
It turned out that bats are well adapted to coronaviruses, both physically and biologically.
For example, the lack of activity of metastatic response in bats, significantly reduced in disease, from CoVs.
In addition, the natural killer of bat cell activity is deactivated, due to a decrease in the natural cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and the low level of synapse of the small complex compound I.
However, high levels of type response oxygen (ROS), which appear in high levels of bat metabolic activity, can halt the increase and recurrence of the coronavirus and have an effect on the ecribonuclease enzyme, thus creating a novel virus-causing stress, with a higher rate of infection as the host enters.
Other pathogenic CoV pressures, they also enter the setting, leading to an increase in protein, or protein characteristics, of the host's transmission.
So it's no coincidence that three types of CoVs have merged in the past two decades.
CoVs are not pathogenic and cause simple symptoms in their hosts, such as bats and camels.
They increase in intensity and are reusable without any strong response to their host immune response.
The secret to why they keep them and not showing any symptoms is in there; and what causes severe cases in humans.
The severe symptoms are usually due to the reactive immune response and the high rate of protein leakage, so the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung injury.
In contrast, in those with undiagnosed symptoms, the immune response has been isolated from CoV replication.
The same strategy of blocking immune response may have beneficial effects in treating SARS-CoV-2.)
The response rates that cells choose to fight the virus are stronger than bats.
Thus, the management of cell-derived proteins, at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 in humans, should be beneficial.
However, the activation of NLRP3-specific proteins is defective in bats.
The presence of NLRP3 protein diversity with MCC950 could be beneficial in the treatment of CoVs.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 causes the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While beta-CoVs have found 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, bat-CoVs also have a 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While civets and other animals in markets have been found to contain SARS-CoV variants, immediate intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
The association of beta-CoVs found in pangolin animals with SARS-CoV-2, which suggests that pangolin animals may function as intermediate hosts, or beta-CoVs can spread genomic fragments to the later SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Although the questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is made by humans, either intentionally or accidentally.
Coronaviruses have emerged due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
Studies of CoVs in bats and other animals have drastically altered our perceptions of the importance of zoonotic origins and the hospitalization of CoVs by human transmission.
Prevalence evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 contain bat strains and are passed on to humans through mild hosts.
As SARS-CoV infection arises from a relationship between humans and civets in markets, closing its markets and killing civets could have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
For this reason, pangolins would have to be eliminated from markets, which would prevent animal-related transmission, thanks to the discovery of beta-CoV genomes closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to people through pangolins and other mammals remains to be determined in future tests.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in dromedary camels for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transportation because they are the main source of meat, milk, skin and wool products for local people.
They're widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels for control of MERS, as was done in the wild animal markets in China, in order to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the spread of MERS, a comprehensive effort should be made to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV into camels, in conjunction with infection control measures.
While we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genetic variants may cause the spread.
Many types of zoonotic CoVs are circulating in the wild.
In particular, bat CoVs with zoonotic origins are diverse.
There are many opportunities for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and recombine, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs more likely to be transmitted and/or potentially fatal in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be banned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the distress of SARS, MERS, and CoVs, better preparation and response plans must be in place.
In fact, many viruses have existed on that planet for a very long time.
They stay in their own natural habitat until there's a chance for spread.
Although bats have many features that contribute to the spread of viruses, the likelihood of human contact with bats and other wild animals may be reduced if people are taught to avoid them.
Persistent surveillance of mammals is necessary for a better understanding of the environment of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will prove beneficial in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future transmission.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent animal transmission of disease is to keep humans away from the environments where the natural habitats of the animals that carry the virus are.
Several issues with the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still unknown.
First, if bats transmit an earlier SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be helpful to see where bats and pangolins share the same environments.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, how humans interact with bats needs to be determined.
Third, if a third mammal acts as an early host, how it interacts with the different species of humans, bats, and pangolins, it has to be explained.
Finally, because many mammals inhabit local animals, they may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, surveillance and infection testing should be conducted.
Should it be a bat, a pangolin, or any other mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its ancestral viruses that are nearly identical will be detected in their natural hosts in the future.
Continued research will explain the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in animals in this regard, along with efforts to eradicate and control CoVs in humans.
Updating the COVID-19 diagnostic criteria requires "dubious case" and "confirmed case".
On 6 February 2020, our team published a rapid advice guideline to diagnose and treat the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) disease, and this guideline provided our experience and guidance for tackling this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing on the basis of ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are constantly updated.
In this letter, we responded to one comment about our guideline and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspected case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh version) published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) began to spread, now officially known as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019), and the virus is called the SARS-CoV-2 acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization identified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to fight against the SARS-CoV-2 disease, our team has developed a fast-track advisory guideline published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It's gotten a lot of attention since it was published.
Note that although COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are constantly updated.
For example, the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, has published a total of seven numbers with some cases that have changed significantly.
Now our guideline received a comment by Zhou et al., giving a simple scoring proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work provided new evidence for our guidance and made valuable reference to this global pandemic.
We support their great work and we thank them.
However, their work needs to be updated according to the latest Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (Test 7 version) and recent studies.
According to the 7th edition (3 March 2020), in order to ensure that suspected cases must combine any of the elements of epidemiological history with two elements of clinical symptoms to perform a comprehensive analysis, or they must contain three elements of clinical symptoms if the epidemiological history is not clear:
Punjabi history: (1) history of travel or settlement in Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the following 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) history of exposure to infected cases of SARS-CoV-2; (3) history of contact with onset of symptoms (such as early onset of CoV-2); and (4) history of onset of onset of symptoms or onset of onset of disease.
Clinical symptoms: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with imaging features of COVID-19 disease; (3) the number of white blood cells showing normal, decreased, or decreased lymphocyte count in the early onset stage.
It is necessary to diagnose confirmed cases based on suspected cases with any SARS-CoV infection or serological evidence as follows: (1) real-time high-positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) full-spectrum viral sequences that show the origin of the novel coronavirus or IG-2; (3) positive-CoV is antibody specific to SARS-CoV.
We can see that a real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in the respiratory tract or blood sample was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
Detection of disease from a blood sample was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then serology evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These modifications were based on the researchers' continued work to search for a nucleic acid detection kit for rapid detection, along with respiratory tract samples including blood samples, which increased the availability of various samples, and supported bringing special antibody positive results into the approved standards.
In addition, there is more and more evidence that reminds us to be aware of typical symptomatic disease and asymptomatic disease.
Therefore, the Zhou et al. chart should be updated, as they considered the person without any clinical symptoms to be "low risk".
It is also necessary to examine the score system in further clinical practice and research.
As a result, we hope that more direct evidence will be available and we ask readers to submit their own comments.
For the identification of “suspected case” and “confirmed case”, we recommend tracking and following the latest guidelines for their own countries.
Our team will also update our guideline in time to offer help.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest daily number
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 on that day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a day due to the virus.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute for Epidemic Control and Research (IEDCR) reported the number of infected cases with 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases remaining at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online effort statement, the director of the IEDCR, Mr. Mirjadi Sabrina Flora, said the fatalities were four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Mirjaddar, two cases were over 60 years of age, two between 51 and 60 years of age and one 41-50 years of age.
She also said that the victims were people from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 March.
A health official told the Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, the director of the Bangladesh Commission on Corruption, who was being monitored at the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, the Minister of Roads and Bridges, Obaidul Ghader, said public transportation would be shut down for longer than planned, until next Saturday.
This public transport stop started first on March 26 and was planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transport of necessary equipment -- medicine, fuel and food -- is still allowed.
The first recorded occurrence of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh was on 8 March, in two people who returned from Italy with the husband of one of them.
By March 19, these three had already healed.
SARS-CoV-2 has surpassed one million diseases worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 cases surpassed one million worldwide, Johns Hopkins University data indicated.
At least 52,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The dramatic change came the same day Malawi announced its first coronavirus infection and Zambia reported its first coronavirus-related death.
On Thursday, North Korea claimed to be one of the few countries without coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, of which 79,332 were in the 24-hour preceding 10 a.m. European Central Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 coronavirus cases have been recorded, linked to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS reported taking into account Johns Hopkins University data of over 1,000 U.S. deaths on Wednesday due to coronavirus infection.
Around the world, countries have announced stricter measures to stop the disease from spreading.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the Moscow governor, extended the stay at home until May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russians would be paid without going to work until April 30.
The Parliament of Portugal voted to extend the national emergency for 15 days; the vote was approved with 215 votes yes, ten abstentions, and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for the rest of the day; earlier, the curfew was only extended from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to implement a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
The governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the state had extended its stay-at-home order until May 1.
Stores in Australia reduce the amount of toilet paper per transaction.
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian supermarket chains Woolworths and Coles reduced their purchases of toilet paper to two packages and one package per transaction in all stores nationwide.
ALDI also imposed a one-pack limit on Monday.
These limitations were posted as messages on the doors and on the chain’s Facebook pages.
Buyers were reported to be afraid of COVID-19 and were buying a lot of things when people needed to self-isolate.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited toilet paper purchases to house delivery to just one package per request.
These changes followed previous four-package restrictions announced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5.
Coles, in his media release on 8 March, stated that the four-pack restriction was in effect, "although most stores still sell within an hour of delivery," and called the request "unpredicted", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on 3 March, called it "unexpected."
Sales rose "sharply" last week, according to a Woolworths speaker.
Last week, the Costco store in Canberra changed the allowed amount for two packages.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles asked for more packaging from suppliers and increased delivery time, while Woolworths asked for more supplies, while ALDI launched its tools for an early planned Wednesday availability.
Russell Zimmerman, CEO of the Australian Retailers Association, said that retailers are trying to increase their purchases, but restricting local councils on the timing of truck deliveries makes it hard.
He expects rising production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer specials.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early availability of goods, some stores can't make a special Wednesday.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, Retailer Professor at Queensland University for Technology, said that stores fill up the supplies every night.
He noted toilet paper was a bulky item, leading to a small number of items, in numbers, and, when sold out, leaves overcrowded shelves, making it difficult to feel a shortage.
According to ABC News Russell Zimmerman said that Coles and Woolworths have an opinion [that] if there is a large amount on the shelf, if products such as toilet paper and cleansing can be purchased [bought] and are in quarantine, then you might reduce the fear.
Recycled toilet paper producer Who Gives a Crap said on Wednesday they had no supplies.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures Kleenex toilet paper and Solaris Paper which produces Sorbent, said they worked 24/7 to protect the supply, according to a News.com.au report.
Domain.com, an affiliate website, reported that some home sellers offered free toilet paper to the first bidders in Melbourne, when fewer bids were made because sellers had plenty of time over the weekend of the Labor Day.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily printed newspaper in Darwin, included eight pages in it to be cut out and used as toilet paper.
The stores were reluctant to impose restrictions, according to an ABC Australia report on March 3 that they had no plans to place any restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, such as masks, cleaners, dryware, soap and flour.
Also, outside Australia, on a Sunday evening, the British online supermarket Ocado was observed limiting sales of Andres toilet paper to two 12-wheelers.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declares COVID-19 as a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 - a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus - as a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" only refers to how widespread a disease is, not how dangerous specific cases are, the WHO noted that governments should take action:
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s general manager, said that all countries can still change the course of the pandemic.
If countries detect, check, treat, isolate, and track them in the response.
We are very concerned about the high levels of spread and severity and the significant levels of non-congestion in Hungary.
According to Dr. Tom Friedin, the former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented."
He said, in publications published by CNN in February, "except for influenza, no other respiratory virus has been followed from outbreaks to ongoing global outbreaks."
Gibraltar put forward a similar view, saying "we've never before seen an epidemic caused by a coronavirus."
He added, "And we've never before seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new status as a pandemic follows the WHO's decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency that is of international concern.
The director of the U.S. Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak, "In short, it's getting worse."
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, leading to more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is a continuous epidemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe respiratory infection of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020, and was recognized as a global pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The case fatality rate has been estimated to be 4% in China, while the world averages 13.04% from Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically five days, but may be between two and 14 days.
There is no known vaccine or antiviral treatment.
Early treatment is symptomatic and complementary therapy.Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping distance with others, and monitoring and self-isolation for those suspected to be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls, and institution closures.
The pandemic has caused severe global socio-economic disruption, the postponement or rejection of sports, religions, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages of supplies caused by stagnation.
Schools and universities have closed either nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting nearly 99.4 percent of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other people of East and South-East-South-China descent, and others in areas with very severe cases of the virus.
Due to reduced travel and massive closures of industry, there have been reduced air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported a cluster of pneumonia cases on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most cases were linked to the Huanan Seafood Recycling Market, and therefore the virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus was the cause of the outbreak known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus associated with bat coronavirus, pangolins coronavirus, SARS-CoV.It was first known to have symptoms and later became ill on 1 December 2019.It was the most visually impaired person in the market.
In early-stage cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds of those contacted had a new meat market.
On 13 March 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Monring Post suggested that a case dates back to 17 November 2019, possibly the first from a 55-year-old in the Hubei region. On 26 February 2020, the World Health Organization said that, with the recent cases surging further in China, but suddenly in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the first cases were higher.
A significant number of cases may not be reported, especially among those with lighter symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases were reported among youths, with those aged 19 and under accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide.The United Kingdom's science advisor, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the British population would need to be infected before there was a crowd-effect immunity.
Cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries had an official policy not to test those with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that in China, as of 23 January, an estimated 86 percent of COVID-19 infections had not been identified, and these undocumented infections were the source of 79% of the recorded cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimates of the number of infections (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has concluded that it may be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not, the time from symptom to death was between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February 80% of deaths were people over the age of 60, and 75% had other health problems such as heart disease and diabetes.The official total number of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refers to dead people who tested positive for COVID-19, according to official protocols.
The number of actual fatalities due to COVID-19 may be much higher, due to the fact that it may involve people who are dying - for example, in aging cells, etc.
Partial data from Italy showed that the number of excessive deaths during the pandemic exceeded the number of deaths from COVID-19 by 4-5 times.
A spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said: "We know that [the reported number of deaths] is expected to be low," an announcement with a one-off report not counted in the United States. This often occurs during the pandemic, being the 9th COVID-19 pandemic since 2009.
The first death outside China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was on 14 February in France.
By 28 February, outside of China, more than a dozen deaths each had been recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By 13 March, more than 40 countries and territories had reported cases of death, in all continents except Antarctica.Many measures are currently being taken to reduce the mortality rate.
These numbers vary by region and time, and are influenced by the amount of testing, quality of the health care system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and general health. The death rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases identified within a given period of time.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global mortality rate is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of 10 April 2020.
The number varies depending on the area.
In China, the prediction of case fatality rate decreased from 17.3% (for those with the onset of symptoms ranged from 1-10 January 2020* to 0.7% (for those with onset of symptoms after 1 February 2020. Other measures include the rate of case fatality (CFR), reflecting the percentile mortality rate of individuals known to have died from the disease, and the rate of mortality (IF) of individuals with underlying conditions.
These statistics are not time-based and follow the specific population of the infection through case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these numbers for a specific population.
The University of Oxford's Center for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates the overall mortality rate for the pandemic to be between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The above-mentioned ratio correlates with the results of the first randomized trial for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study that analyzes the effect of testing on CFR estimates.
The World Health Organization proves that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and the time at the end of the outbreak are unclear and may vary depending on location.
Massij Bonny of Penn State University said, "Without screening, the epidemic spread is generally high and then it begins to decline when the disease loses the available host.
But you can't make a reasonable guess now when it's going to be."
Chinese government senior medical adviser Zhong Nanshan argued that "it may end in June" if all countries could be prepared to follow WHO's advice to measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the University of London for Hygienical and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will go away for a year or two".
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, social distancing and other measures will be required "until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus -- because it's so transmissible -- will disappear completely" and "may become a seasonal disease, coming back every year."
The viciousness of the return depends on the collective immunity and the rate of mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Other common low symptoms include dizziness, shortness of breath, loss of sensation, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, dizziness, headache, colds, vomiting, bleeding, coughing, diarrhea, diarrhea, or bluesting of skin. The World Health Organization says that about one in six people have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) determines emergency symptoms such as difficulty breathing, pain or persistent breast pressure, acute typhoid fever, trouble with vision, and blu-shaped face or lips; immediate medical attention is needed if symptoms persist. Increased blood pressure, pneumonia, and pneumonia are likely to cause these symptoms.
Some of those infected may show no symptoms, with no clinical signs but with test results that confirm the infection, so researchers have drawn advice that those with close contact with confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and examined to rule out infection.
Chinese estimates of the absence of symptoms range from mild to 44%.
The duration of stay (the time between infection and symptom onset) is between one and 14 days; the most common is five days.As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who experienced loss of sense of smell was initially 30% and subsequently decreased to 15%.
Some details about how the disease is spread are still being identified.
The disease is believed to be primarily spread during close contact and by small pupils during coughing, sneezing or talking; close contact is thought to be 1-3 feet (3-6 feet).
Studies have found that uncovered coughing causes cockroaches to travel up to 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 (27 feet).
Some have suggested that the virus may be transmitted through small droplets that remain in the air for longer periods of time, which may be produced during speech.The respiratory droplets may also be formed during breathing, including speech, although the virus is generally not airborne.
The droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or can be dragged into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as thrombosis and cardiomyopathy (CPR), may cause the outflows of the lungs to become airborne in this way.
It may also spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth.
While there are concerns that it may be spread by waste, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of waste-borne transmission of SARS-CoV2.The virus is widespread within the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the outbreak may occur before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.
People have tested positive for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms, suggesting that the onset of symptoms may occur before significant symptoms appear.
There are only few reported asymptomatic laboratory cases confirmed, but asymptomatic transmission has been recognized by several countries during contact tracing studies.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others.The virus remains alive on surfaces for many hours.
In particular, the virus was found on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 steel for three days, on cardboard for one day, and copper for up to four days.
However, this depends on the humidity and temperature.Pets and other animals have been infected with COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities advise washing their hands after touching animals, such as after contact with surfaces that infected people might have touched.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, first isolated from three people with severe pneumonia for a subset of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
All features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the nature of related coronavirus.Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which melts its protective coating.SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to have an animal breed.
The general analysis has revealed that the CoV genetically binds to the genus Betacoronavirus, in the later genus Sarbecovirus (line B) together with two bat-derived strains.
It is 96% similar to the genetic level of other bat coronaviruses (BatCov TaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers concluded that there was only one amino acid difference in parts of the genome sequence between viruses from pangolins and those from humans.
To date, the genetic comparison has reached about 92% of the genetic material shared between pangolins coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is not sufficient to prove pangolins were the intermediate host.
Infection with the virus can be based on symptoms, although confirmation is ultimately done by reversing the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected prosthesis or CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, which is less specific, with imaging features similar to those of other pneumonia processes and other diseases.
By March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used for testing or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19".
The World Health Organization has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
The test uses real-time reverse-tradition polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are generally available within a few hours to days.
Generally, this test is done in nasopharyngeal swabs although throat swab may also be used.A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these have been confirmed to be accurate for widespread adoption.
In the United States, serological testing by Cellex has been developed and approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
Specific imaging features on radiographs and computed tomography (CTs) of people who are symptomatic include non-smooth glass translucent exposure and non-conductive radiation.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an online database of imaging results from confirmed cases.
Due to complications of other diseases such as adenovirus, radiation without confirmation by PCR is a limited feature in detecting COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the results of CT to PCR and showed that although imaging is less specific to the infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting that it should be considered as a testing tool in pandemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-driven neural networks have been developed to discover imaging features with radiographs and CTs.
Strategies for preventing transmission of the disease include maintaining personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, coughing or sneezing on a tissue and throwing the tissue directly into a trash bag.
Those who have the disease themselves have been advised to wear a mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission.Many governments have restricted or advised against any non-essential travel to or from countries or areas affected by the disease.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community spread in parts of the world.
This means that the virus spreads through the community, and members of some communities don't know where or how they are infected.Health care providers care about someone who may be infected using standardized exposure precautions and eye protection.Contact tracing is an important way for health authorities to determine the source of the disease and prevent further transmission.
The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, as well as international pardons and more than 100 other organizations that have issued a statement calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
Many mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of March 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record user interactions on other phones.
Users then receive a message if they are in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.Misconceptions have been circulated about how to prevent infection; for example, nasal rinsing and rinsing with a mouthwash is not helpful.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, although organizations may be working to develop one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after sneezing, coughing or sneezing.
This is because outside of the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which bursts its efficient bubble.
CDC further recommended using alcohol-based cleaners with at least 60% alcohol content when soap and water are not available.
The WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The surfaces may be cleaned with a certain amount of cleansing (within a minute of contact with the cleansing agent for the steel coating), containing 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hydrochloride, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% iodine.
Other medications, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorohexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if the case of COVID-19 is suspected or confirmed in an institution such as an office or day care facility, all locations, such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, electronics-shared equipment such as tablets, desktops, tablets, ROMs, controls, and ATM devices used by a patient should be treated with a clear antiviral.
Health organizations recommend covering the mouth and nose with a bent elbow or a tissue when coughing or sneezing, and dropping the tissue immediately.
Health masks are recommended for those who may have been infected with the virus, as wearing a mask reduces the size and range of walking droplets from breathing during speech, nausea, and coughing.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidelines for when and how masks should be used.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "mask coverings can reduce people's exposure to facial expressions, which is a major source of infection without hand hygiene."
The WHO has recommended wearing masks by healthy people if they are at high risk, such as those who are caring for an infected person with COVID-19, although they acknowledge that wearing masks may help people avoid touching their faces.
Many countries have begun to encourage the use of face masks by the general public.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing non-medical face masks made of cloth.China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy publics, especially when in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask when using public transport or staying in crowded areas.
Thai health officials are encouraging people to make cloth face masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from going outside without wearing a mask or covering their nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam asked everyone to wear a mask when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has mandated that everyone who goes to the store should wear a mask.
Israel has asked all residents to wear face masks while in public.
Taiwan, which has produced 10 million face masks a day since mid-March, has asked passengers on trains and buses to wear face masks on 1 April.
Panamá has made it mandatory to wear a face mask when going out, while recommending the creation of a homemade face mask for those who can't afford to buy a face mask.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as "Fire Retardation") includes disease control practices intended to slow the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
Methods include quarantines, travel restrictions; and closures of schools, workplaces, stadiums, stadiums, or shopping centres.
Individuals may apply social distancing measures by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using contactless greetings, and physical distancing.
Many governments are now promoting or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.
The largest gathering size by U.S. government agencies and health organizations has been reduced from 250 people (if there is no known COVID-19 spread in the region) to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two individuals. Older adults and people with underlying health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, chronic hypertension, and immunodeficiency disorders are facing a higher risk of severe disease and are advised by the CDC to stay at home at low-income end-of-life sites.
The use of the term "social distancing" has been driven by the fact that individuals should engage in full-scale social distancing, rather than encouraging them to stay in touch with others through alternative causes.Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.
These include recommendations to only have sex with the person you live with, who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home has been recommended for those with COVID-19 and those suspected to be infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation.Many governments have ordered or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The strongest self-quarantine instructions have been given to those in the high-risk group.
Those who may have been in contact with someone who has COVID-19 and who has recently travelled to a country or region with widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days after the last contact.
Strategies in controlling an outbreak are containment or containment, and mitigation.
Containment is included in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to detect and isolate those infected, as well as to include other containment measures and vaccines to stop the disease from spreading to other parts of the population.
When it is no longer feasible to control the spread of the disease, efforts then proceed to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the health and community care system.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.
Suppression requires more measures, so as to reverse the spread of the disease from person to person to below one part of managing and dealing with the emergency outbreak of infectious disease is to try to reduce the peak of the outbreak, known as the flattening of the epidemic.
This reduces the risk of over-pressure from service providers and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Practices of non-pharmaceuticals that may control the spread include individual protection measures, such as hand sanitization, mask wearing, and self-isolation; community practices intended for physical distancing such as school closures and denials of convention conventions; community engagement as a whole encourages adoption and participation in such practices; with environmental distancing measures.
Other countries also adopted a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea conducted mass testing and localized quarantines, and issued a warning about the movements of infected people.
Singapore has provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed severe penalties for those who do not.
Taiwan has increased mask production and is punishable by mass purchase of medical supplies.The same holds true for Great Britain and the United States showing that reductions (slowing rather than stopping the spread of the pandemic) and suppression (suppressing epidemic growth) have major challenges.
Good mitigation policies may reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being disrupted.
Suppression can be preferred, but it must be maintained until the virus is circulated in the human community (or until a vaccine is available, if that's first), as transmission develops when measures are relaxed.
Long-term action to curb the pandemic can result in social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral treatments for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing of currently available treatments.
Taking cold-resistant treatments, drinking fluids, and resting may help alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, fluid through the nerves, and respiratory support may be needed.
The use of choppers may worsen outcomes.
Several compounds that were previously approved for treatment of other viral diseases are being studied for use in treating COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also said some "traditional and localized treatments" could provide relief to the symptoms of SARX-CoV-19.
Increasing the capacity and benefit of health care to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients has been described by the World Health Organization as a pandemic prevention measure.
The ECDC and the European Regional Authorities to the World Health Organization have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to shift resources at multiple levels, including focusing on lab services to test COVID-19, rejecting available diagnostic guidelines whenever applicable, segregating COVID-19 positive patients, and increasing capacity for care.
There are several theories about where the first case (the so-called "zero disease") might arise.
The first known case of the novel coronavirus may date back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
Most of them were linked to the Huan Seafood Whole Market, where they were sold live animals, and one theory was that the virus came from one of these animals; or, in other words, it had an animal breed. A case of unknown cause of pneumonia was reported in the CDC on 26 December, and was notified by Dr. Zhang Xiaoxing at the hospital.
On 30 December, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital alerted their colleagues about a "SARS-like coronavirus".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were alerted by the police to spreading false propaganda, and another, Ai Fen, had been rebuked by his superiors for raising the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public notice on 31 December and informed the World Health Organization.
Significant cases of unknown pneumonia were reported by health authorities in Wuhan to initiate an investigation in early January.In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other regions of China, with the help of the Chinese New Year migration and Wuhan being a transportation hub and train hub.
On 20 January, China reported about 140 new cases, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later official data showed that as of 20 January 2020, approximately 6,174 people had developed symptoms.On 26 March, the United States surpassed China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.On 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide, over 97,000 died and over 364,000 recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Because of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Area restricted and placed independent movements under border control.
National responses include containment measures such as quarantine (known as a stay-at-home order, shuttle order, or self-driving home) and a travel ban.On 2 April, approximately 300 million people, approximately 90% of the population, are homeless in some form of shelter in the United States, over 50 million are cross-contaminated in Sub-Saharan Africa, approximately 59 million in the Philippines.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of homelessness, rising to 2.6 billion in just two days -- about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; one unconfirmed report suggests that the earliest case was on 17 December.
Dr. Zhang Jixan noticed a case of pneumonia of unknown cause on 26 January, by which his hospital informed Wuhan Jianghan's CDC on 27 January.
Initial genetic testing of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
A public notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
The World Health Organization was informed on the same day.
As these notifications occurred, doctors in Wuhan were alerted by the police to a "spreading of propaganda" about the spread of disease.
First, the Chinese National Health Commission claimed there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign later described by the Chinese Communist Party's general secretary as a "people's war" to contain the spread of the virus.
As described as the "greatest quarantine in human history", a January 23 announcement was made to stop travel in and out of Wuhan, which was extended to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting up to 57 million people.
Private vehicle use was banned in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (25 January) were cancelled in many places.

Lewis, the traffic ban in India would put an estimated 90,000 million mobile workers out of work (which would be paid daily wages) in 2020.[44] His assessment of the unemployment agency in Spain found that 44% of households were unemployed.[44]
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment payments and 1 million British workers applied for a global fundraising program.Almost half a million companies in Germany sent government funds to their workers based on a short-term plan known as Kurzarbeit.
The German Schedule of Temporary Work Schedule was implemented in France and the United Kingdom.
The aspects of the arts, practice and civic heritage have become increasingly problematic by the pandemic, affecting organizations’ practices as well, both individually and collectively.
Arts and civil society organizations have made efforts to raise their (their) public funds to provide access to civil waste to society, to maintain the protection of their institutions and to assist artists when possible.
In March 2020, all over the world and to change the status quo of universities, museums, libraries, performance venues and other civil institutions were closed without warning and exhibitions, events and presentations were cancelled or postponed.
In response, there have been intensive efforts to provide services through the digital platform, a new and notorious disease has suspended religious services and numerous sporting and social events, such as music festivals, concerts, technology conferences, and fashion shows.
The film's production also came under strain, with the Vatican declaring Holy Week in Rome, which falls on the final week of Christian penance during the Lent season, to be rejected.
Many elderly Christian clergymen were told to stay at home and not to attend Sunday religious events; some churches offered religious services via radio or online live streaming or television, while others served on the streets.
With the closure of the Roman Catholic Church in Rome, churches and branch offices and places of Christian denominations were closed, other religions also suspended services and gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, and shrines.
Iran's health minister said Friday prayers in the affected areas and mosques were closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the arrival of foreign pilgrims to holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the world's largest disruption to sporting activities since the Second World War.
Most sporting events have either been postponed or postponed, including the 2019-2020 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-2020 Premier League, the 2019-2020 NBA season, and the 2019-2020 NHL season.
The outbreak of the disease caused a crisis for the Summer Olympic Games plans for 2020, which were decided to take place in March.The National Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the Olympic Games would be postponed to the end of 2020 but that they would not be postponed until the summer of 2021.
This has led to players moving online, with many gambling websites having a very high rate of new entrants, and the number of people attending has also been compromised, with music groups delaying or suspending concerts as the virus unfolds.
Many theatres such as Broadway suspended all their activities.
Some artists have explored new ways to keep their products alive and share their work online as an alternative to traditional life creation, such as creating online concerts or creating festival websites for artists to showcase.
Online, numerous coronavirus comics articles have been published that have led to many confusions and controversies.
Since COVID-19 has spread, high levels of hatred, fear of neighbouring countries, and racism have been observed among the people of China and Southeast Asia, and against people from political regions of Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Pacific region in Asia.
Reports from February (when most cases were still in China) showed a sense of racism by groups around the world claiming that Chinese people deserved the virus or received what they had been asked for as punishment.
Some countries in Africa also expressed strong opposition to the Chinese.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported separations due to their regional origins.
There was support for the Chinese, both in direct and on-line mode, moving their aid to areas affected by the virus.
The spread of the virus is progressing to developed countries.People from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a series of COVID-19 cases, were suspicious.People from Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have filed lawsuits against banning Chinese citizens from entering their countries, as an attempt to contain the disease.
In Japan, the Hashtag <0x23>ChineseMeen to Japan had taken over Twitter.
Chinese people, like other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States, have also reported rising levels of ethnic cleansing, as well as psychological assaults.
U.S. President Donald Trump has been criticized for referring to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus," which has been criticized by critics as racist and anti-Chinese.
Ukrainian protesters attacked Ukrainian and foreign-owned buses from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhari.
Students who come from North India, which is a neighboring country in China, and have conducted several bold research experiments on the spread of coronavirus in many Indian universities.
The political leader of Baratia Janata in the west, Bengal Dilip Khost, declared that the Chinese had destroyed nature and said, "So this is God's vengeance against them."
The remarks were later denounced by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, dubbed "false alarm".In China, hatred, xenophobia, and racism against Chinese foreign students were heightened by the pandemic, with foreigners described as "foreign trash" and aimed at expelling them.
Numerous private newspapers have deleted online news feeds due to coronavirus news outlets.
Many science-fiction journals prepared the link to the spread of the virus with the entries in the news in a systematic way.
Some scientists quickly chose to share their results online, as well as their website BioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for the respiratory tract of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and its relation to the SARS-CoV-2 virus include a number of items that research the presence of the virus and those that research produce antibodies against infection.
The presence of the virus in specimens has been confirmed by RT-PCR which studies coronavirus RNA.
This test is special and designed only to study RNA from the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm many new and active infections.
Antibody research can be used to diagnose diseases and monitor populations.
Antibody tests show how many people had the disease, including those whose symptoms were less pronounced or who were asymptomatic.
An accurate mortality rate of the disease and overall population level can be determined from the results of the tests.
According to limited trials, as of March 2020, no country had reliable data on the spread of the virus in its population.
On 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there are varying views on how tests performed in other countries.
This variant is likely to become more effective in severe cases, which are likely to be highly evaluated in some countries.
The use of replicating polymer chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing can be performed on respiratory samples obtained by various types of viruses, including nasopharyngeal tests and saliva samples.
Results are generally available within a few hours to two days.
The RT-PCR test performed with the throat test is the only reliable test in the first week of the disease.
Later on, the virus can disappear in the throat while continuing to increase in the lungs.
For people infected with second-week-old testing, the sample of the material can then be taken deep into the respiratory tract by means of a gastrointestinal tract or can be administered via coagulation.
One of the initial PCR tests was developed at Charity University in Berlin in January 2020 using reverse transcription polymer chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and developed 250,000 medical supplies to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK had developed a test on 23 January 2020.The South Korea-based company Cogeniboach has discovered a new medical portal, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection (strength surveillance of coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
The Inter-American Trials were carried out under the terms "E" of the Common Trials of all the novel coronavirus receptors, and the United States General RdRp genome is specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, the BGI group was one of the first to receive emergency kits from the Chinese Ministry of Health, the PCR-backed Trials.
One of those genetic tests for the test kit version caused inconclusive results due to inaccurate use of substances and a bottleneck of testing at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully administered throughout February 2020.
Tests using two different elements were not determined to be credible on 28 February 2020.It was not until then that it stated that local and state laboratories were allowed to carry out the test.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under a state of emergency.The test was launched by US laboratories in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020 LabCorp announced the availability of national COVID-19 testing based on RT-PCR.
The Infectious Disease Prevention Agency similarly published a nationwide COVID-19 screening as of 9 March 2020.
No amount of identification was provided, sample collection and follow-up should be carried out according to CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the virological and bacterial research center VECTOR.
On 11/2/2020 the test was recorded by the Federal Service for Emergency Care.On 12 March 2020, the Mayo Clinic reported that it had developed a series of tests for COVID-19 infection research.On 13 March 2020, the Roach Patient Detection Institute received FDA approval for a 24-hour trial that can be administered in 3.5 hours of intensive care, in a 428-hour span, this way the device is operated.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted the UAE license to Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's 2,000-meter system. The FDA initially granted similar authorization to Hologic, LabCorp, and Sermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received EUA authorization from the FDA to perform a test that would take 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses nucleic acid synthesis technology instead of PCR.
Because this does not require a series of temperature changes, this method can deliver positive test results in just 5 minutes and negative test results in 13 minutes.
There are now approximately 18,000 of these devices in the United States. And Abbott expects to increase the rate to perform 50,000 tests per day. A test that uses antibody data and combines binding nucleic protein (N protein) tests of a novel coronavirus developed in Taiwan, with 15 minutes of follow-up testing, with hopes of doing so.
A March 2020 literature review concluded that "single-ray images have little role in diagnosing the disease at an early stage, while in CT (computing simulations) findings may occur even before early symptoms."
Typical trends on CT include bidirectional, multi-degree glass, geometry, asymmetries, and back divisions.
Subpleural dominance, insanity and consolidation are dealt with as the disease grows.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan at the point of origin of the current pandemic has suggested that CT is more sensitive than PCR, although less accurate, with the visualization of a distinctive ethic with pneumonia and disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology announced that "CP should not be used to screen for and diagnose COVID-19".In March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR approval for initial screening.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to conduct research in people within 7 days of the onset of infection or after the onset of the first symptoms to determine immunity to the body and in patients.Tests can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or by point-of-care (PoCT) testing.
The high-performance automation systems in several clinical laboratories would be able to perform these tests, but their availability would depend on the production rate for each system.
For CLT, an external blood test sample is most commonly used, although serial samples can be used to track the response of the tumor.
For PoCT, a blood sample is usually obtained through skin pores.
Unlike PCR steps, an extraction step is not required prior to testing.On 26 March 2020, the FDA released the names of 29 agencies that provided alerts to the agency as required and are now available to distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only a single test has been approved by the FDA under emergency use authorization, at the end of March 2020, European clinical laboratories and Epitope Diagnostics Europe have received approval for their laboratory kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The test is capable of performing about six samples within an hour and therefore faster than the normal PCR test for viral RNA.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after the initial infection, and in early March, the United Kingdom could not find any laboratory antibodies, so buying antibodies that were good for use.
Hong Kong sets out a plan that suspected patients can stay at home. Emergency emergency syringes provide patients with a sample taken, spit it out and return it, and then take the test results.The British NHS has stated that they are testing a plan for suspected use in the home and that they will be able to handle COVID-19 in a timely manner, with or without adequate exposure to the patient.
The delivery centers have been helping South Korea, conducting some of the fastest and most extensive tests in countries.In Germany, the National Association of Health Insurance Authorities said on 2 April that it had been able to conduct 12,000 tests per day in a mobile task, and 10,700 were taken in the previous week.
Costs are borne by health insurance when the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to the head of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the ability to conduct over 160,000 tests per week.
As of 19 March, mobile inspections were carried out in many large cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were reported.
The first measurement lab shows that, as the GI-series on 12/2020 tested at least 483,295 samples, and between the weeks of 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9 percent) were positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, the researchers at the hospitals of Reunion and Rambam developed a new way of testing 64 samples from time to time.
By monitoring BGI founder Wang Jian and for 5 days, the actions showed cases in Hubei would be 47% higher and the stated cost of the quarantine efforts would have doubled if the testing capacity had not been available.
Wan's lab was directly connected by Ho-Yan labs in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 21 cities in China.
As of March 4, 2020, the daily majority of tests were 50,000 tests per day, open sourced by Open Chemistry Maps, released by Origami Tests, which could test 1,122 patient samples for COVID-19 using just 93 tests, these stationary maps can be used in small laboratories without the need for liquid testing machines.
In March, the lack of chemical glass, melamine bottles, were used for intensive testing in Europe and the UK.
This led authors to study prototype testing protocols that showed samples with temperatures of 98 <0xC2><0xB0>C (208 <0xC2><0xB0>F) for 5 minutes to include genome RNA for a detailed test.On 31 March, it was reported that the UAE and the United States had higher levels of coronavirus tests for each individual population, and higher levels of coronavirus tests for each other population.
This was based on a combination of motor-testing capabilities and the purchase of laboratory supplies in groups 42 and BGI (depends on the Huo-Yun Emergency Research Laboratories in China).
Maintained for 14 days, the lab is capable of conducting 10,000 ST-PCR tests per day, the first to be recorded outside of China.
Different tests of receptors to determine the different genetic variants of coronavirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German idea to create test kits that are sent to poor countries where they do not have the resources to develop their own.
The German idea was published on 17 February 2020, the protocol developed by the United Nations Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28 February, postponing the arrival of tests in China and the United States had trouble convincing test kits were available at the outset of the outbreak.The countries and Australasia were unable to provide the necessary testing requirements for health care.
In contrast, experts say the widespread availability of South Korea-based testing helped reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Testing frequency, largely in private labs, has been developed for many years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) called for an increase in appraisals to be the best way to show the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic.The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus was the reason why hundreds of thousands of tests had not been conducted in US labs, and the preparation of test kits and biochemical bottles were identified.
In March 2020, China reported that it was having trouble with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, testing equipment developed by the CDC for faulty data was then removed by the government, which banned private testing.Spain purchased testing equipment from Chinese company Shenzhen Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were inaccurate.
The company explained that the wrong results may be the result of incorrect collection of samples or incorrect use of the materials.
The Spanish ministry said that the equipment was returning and making a mistake, and that it was being replaced by various experimental equipment supplied by Shenzhen Biosimilar.80% of the laboratories that the Czech Republic bought in China were giving the wrong result.Slovakia was making 1.2 million nonsmoker test kits from China.
Slovakia's Prime Minister Matovi<0xC4><0x87> suggested they would be sent to Danube. Atticus Kara, at the Turkish Ministry of Health, stated that the Turkish laboratory equipment purchased in China had "excess errors", and "wasn't exploited". The United Kingdom used 3.5 million laboratory equipment in Scandinavian but was unused until early March 2020.[citation needed]
Testing, with quarantine of those who tested positive and finding those who were in contact with SARS-CoV-2 infected people who were infected.
Researchers working on the town of Voi in Italy, which was the first in a series of fatalities due to COVID-19, conducted two tests on the entire population of nearly 3,400 people, over a period of 10 days.
Nearly half of those tested positive had no symptoms, and all identified cases were quarantined.
With travel to particular areas, it eliminated entirely new cases.
With strict search and enforcement, travel restrictions, and testing and quarantining, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has spread much more slowly than in other developed countries.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay at home on 28 March, but schools reopened on time after their break on 23 March.
Many countries have faced the pandemic with various forms of infectious isolation, including stopping travel, testing, and quarantining, but without severe traffic restrictions such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study has found that countries that have tested higher and more closely with the number of deaths, the case fatality rate is lower, probably because these countries are better prepared to do this in people with weak or no symptoms.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that countries that do not have the capacity to conduct tests and national laboratories with experience with COVID-19 send the first five positive and ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories to confirm testing.
Of the 16 laboratory sources, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In lists, the "positive percent test" column is developed by the country's testing police.
A country that only tests people who are admitted to hospitals will have a higher positive incidence of pneumonia than a country that tests all citizens, whether they are symptomatic or not, all other things being equal.
Hand washing (or hand washing, also known as hand hygiene) is the process of washing hands for the purpose of removing dirt, fat, microorganisms, and other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap to ensure "hazardous times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhea and cholera, which are transported by feces.
People may also be affected by respiratory diseases such as influenza or common cold, for example, if they don't wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The five most serious times during the day when hand washing with soap is important include before and after disinfection, after cleaning a child's basement or changing a child's nursery, before feeding a child, before eating, and after preparing food or preparing meat, fish, and birds.
If water and soap are not available, you can wash your hands in ash.The World Health Organization recommends hand washing:
Before and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing the diaper or cleaning up a child who's been in the bathroom.
After nosebleeds, coughing, sneezing.
After touching animal, animal feed, or animal waste.
Health hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical outcomes.
Hand washing before medical procedures or medical supervision can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse the hands of germs (bacteria, viruses, or other microbes that can cause disease), and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people who cook or work in medical settings, but also an important practice for public spaces.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including the prevention of the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; prevention of transmission of diarrhea; reduction of respiratory infections.
And that includes a reduction in infant mortality at home birth rates.
A 2013 study suggested that improvements in hand washing practice may contribute to further developmental length in children under 5 years of age.
In developing countries, child mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhea disorders can be reduced by introducing different behaviors such as hand washing with soap.
This simple procedure can reduce the mortality rate in these countries by almost 50 percent.
Hand washing can reduce diarrhea episodes by about a third, and this is equivalent to providing clean water in impoverished villages.
48% reduction in diarrhea episodes can be associated with hand washing with soap.Hand washing with soap is one of the most effective and inexpensive ways to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI), as automatic behavior performed at home, in schools, and in communities around the world.
pneumonia, a major ARI, is the number one cause of death in children under five, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths per year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together account for about 3.5 million child deaths each year.
According to UNICEF, hand washing with soap before eating and after bathing can be an established practice that can save more lives than any vaccine or medical treatment, preventing diarrhea by 50 percent and death from severe respiratory disease by one-fourth.
Hand washing is often associated with other hygiene treatments as part of water purification and sanitation.
Hand washing also protects you from skin irritation that is transmitted directly through physical contact.
A small adverse effect of hand washing is that too much hand washing can cause skin damage due to drying of the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to pores and skin adipose conditions known as hand antibodies or hand flushing, which are particularly common among health care workers.
Too frequent hand washing is seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five times during the day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce the risk of transmission of fecal disease; after going to the bathroom (measured and disinfected), after cleaning a child's underwear (disinfection), before eating, before and after preparing food, or preparing meat, fish, and birds.
Other occasions where proper hand-washing techniques should be applied to prevent disease transmission, which include before and after treating a wound, after sneezing or sneezing, after touching animal waste or dealing with animal behavior, and after touching waste.
In many countries, there is a low rate of hand washing with soap.
A 2015 study of child hand washing in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7 percent of people wash at home have soap.A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia has the highest rates of late hand washing in school, with 97 percent, and the United States has the average rate of hand washing in school, with 77 percent, and China has the lowest rates of hand washing in children, with only 23 percent of different behavioral changes.
The basic health care program implemented by parts of Europe in the Philippines is an example of an approach to improving children's health and education.
Removal worms twice a year, added to daily hand washing with soap, brushing your teeth with flushing, are the most important part of this international program.
This has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Removal of microbes from skin is enhanced by the addition of soaps or tits to water.
The most important function of soaps and tits is to reduce barriers and increase the power of the reservoir.
Water alone is an inactive skin cleanser due to fats and proteins, which are not dissolved directly.
Hygiene is, in any case, subsidized by a flow of water.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, captures bacteria needed by previous users.
A small number of studies working on bacterial transfer from salty soap have found that the transporter does not extend as bacteria are added to the foam.
The CDC still says "soap liquid with hand control for cleansing is preferable."
Antibacterial soaps offer expensive public health care.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of certain antibiotic or antimicrobials determines antibiotic resistance of organisms in nature.
After all, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as antibacterial products, which have an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms.
So, even if the antibiotic-resistant strains are not assigned to antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are advertised to be.
With soap and protective agents of the skin, complex bitters may consist of acids (aseptic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) such as pH tracers, antibacterial activity benzonic acids, and skin constipation (alon vera, vitamins, mensul, pesticides). Extensive analysis is done at the University of Sausage Oakland.
Hot water that's comfortable to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at 37 <0xC2><0xB0>C (37 <0xC2><0xB0>C) of the body.
However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water at removing natural fats that hold dirt and bacteria.
Contrary to national myths however, scientific experiments have shown that using hot water has no effect on reducing microbes on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer is a hand sanitizer without the use of water.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-based hand sanitizers began to become available to the population without using water (also known as alcohol-based hand sanitizers, alcohol-based hand sanitizers, and hand sanitizers).
Most are dependent on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated together with a chemical detergent such as carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) into a solution, or a mixture such as glycerin into a liquid, or foam that is easy to use, or to reduce the drying effect of the alcohol.
Increasing the activity of the antimicrobial activity, including hand sanitizers containing a minimum alcohol content of 60 to 95 percent, which is an active microbial killer.
Alcohol sanitizers kill bacteria, multiple antibiotic-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV and sexually transmitted diseases, RSV and Rhinovirus, Vaccinia virus, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based detergents contain 70% alcohol, 99.97% (3.5 logarithms are an amplitude, corresponding to 35 amplitudes of sound) in bacteria on hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99 to 99.999% (4-5 amplitude logarithms) in bacteria on hands One minute after application, hand sanitizers are more effective against bacteria and less resistant to infection
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are not effective against infectious viruses (or Norovirus) variants of the virus, butterflies that cause stomach ailments, and adequate detergents or alcohol-based detergents should be used to thoroughly wet or cover the hands.
The front and back of both hands and between and the ends of all fingers are wiped for up to 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or liquid material is dry.
The tips of the fingers must also be well washed and reconstructed in the palm of the hand.The United Nations Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing before hand washing with liquid, especially when hands are visibly dirty.
The increase in these substances depends on their ease of use and the speed at which microbes are killed, however, they should not serve as a substitute for hand washing unless soap and water are available.
Many uses of alcohol hand sanitizers can cause drying of the skin unless creams or skin moisturizers are added to the procedure.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin or other skin creams to the treatment.
In medical treatments, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing skin creams that are less likely to cause skin irritation or dryness than soaps and antimicrobials.
Sensitivity to hand soreness, swelling redness or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives from alcohol wipes rarely occur.
The lower readiness to increase convection density became much more contagious compared to soap and water hand washing.
Despite their effect, non-water-based detergents don’t clean every part of the hand but simply rinse it down.
It is for this season that hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, which is why disease-causing factors still remain on the hands.
Alcohol’s hand sanitizer ability is strongly dependent on its ingredients and ingredients, and historically has been unsuccessful.
Recently, formulations that use benzalconium chloride have been shown to have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, as opposed to alcohol, which has been shown to reduce efficacy after reuse, possibly due to highly adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income countries can't get soap and use soil or ash instead.
Soil or ash may be more effective than water alone, but they may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, ash also kills germs because in their fusion with water, it forms a liquid.
WHO recommended soil or ash as an alternative to soap when soap was not available.
The correct hand washing technique recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Running water is recommended as it may be contaminated while remaining in the body, while the temperature of the water cannot be seen to make a difference.
Hands should be washed with soap, including the back of the hands, between the fingers, and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and scientific research shows that people tend to wash their hands more often when they have soap than when washing their hands only with water.
Scrub with soap for at least 20 seconds.
Scrubbing creates friction, which helps remove microbes from the skin, and the more you scrub your hand, the more germs it kills.
Rinse well with running water.
Washing your hands in a tub can contaminate your hands.
Dry with a clean towel or let it in the air dry.
Wet and moist hands are easily contaminated, most commonly in places where there is a risk of contamination from the scalp arm, wrist, area between the fingers and under fingernails.
Artificial nails and artificially crafted nails could be the site of microbial collection.
Moisturizing skin tightness is recommended to keep the hands from drying out, dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the transmission of the infection.
Options for vaccines can be made to facilitate hand washing when running water and soap are unavailable, such as carrying water in a jacket or using dumplings in fertilizer or using ash if it is necessary in other countries. In some cases, water scarcity (such as schools or in rural areas of treatment) "are also associated with water scarcity."
Water detergent is a simple technology using a cushioned cushion with a hammer, and a foottip to pour a little water on the hands and a bar of soap.
The effect of drying hands is an essential part of a hand-washing procedure, but there is some opinion on the effect of drying hands in public washrooms.
A research-driven book suggests toilet paper is much more hygienic than electric hand dryers found in some washrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster in London, and sponsored by the craftsman of European textile toilet paper, to compare the cleaning levels of toilet paper, and thermal hand dryer news and modern hand dryer devices.
After washing and drying hands with warm-air dryers, the total number of bacteria on the surface of the fingers increased by 194 percent and on the palms by 254 percent.
Drying with the air-conditioning machine has shown that the total number of bacteria on the surface of the finger has increased by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with paper towels, the total number of bacteria was reduced to 76% on the fingertips and 77% on the palms.The scientists also conducted experiments to find the possibility of contamination by other washroom users and the room climate as a result of drying methods.
The high-speed hand dryer, which exhales air, can quickly excrete 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 m/h) of microorganisms from the hands and tissue, potentially polluting other washroom users and polluting the environment of the handwashing room for up to 2 meters.
Using a hot air dryer spreads microbes up to 0.25 meters from the machine.
Cinnamon towels showed no unrecognizable microbes.A 2005 study was conducted by TUV Proctet and <0xC3><0x96>muelt, evaluating hand drying methods.
Changes in bacterial count were noted after drying the hands:
There are many different professional dryers, and hand dryers are compared to drying with paper towels.
Hand washing using wet wipes is an alternative to lacking soapy water during travel.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand-washing became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effect (in 1846) in preventing disease in the hospital environment.
There are electrical devices that remind hospital teams to wash their hands when they forget.
One study has found that infection rates have decreased with hand washing.
Medical hand washing should last at least 15 seconds, using a small amount of soap and water or liquid to rinse and rinse all parts of the hands.
Hands should be rinsed together by mixing and rinsing parts of hands together.
If there is dirt under fingernails, a sharpened brush can be used to remove it.
Since microbes may remain in the water on your hands, it's important to rinse well and dry with a clean towel.
After drying, the toilet paper must be used to remove water (or open any open door if necessary) from the toilet.
This protects hands from re-contamination from those surfaces.
The goal of hand-washing in health care settings is to eliminate pathogens.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of hand-washing at an unacceptable level in the medical environment and that most doctors and nurses forget to wash their hands before touching the patient, thus transmitting microbes.
One study has shown that proper hand washing and other actions can reduce blood infections by 66 percent.The World Health Organization has published a paper demonstrating standard hand washing and hand hygiene in healthcare settings.
A method of directing hand washing by the organization can be available on its website for public consultation.
-- an appropriate review was conducted by Hitchcock and others.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene, if demonstrating regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has "Five Time" for Handwashing:
After exposure to blood clots
Before a germ-cleaning task, and
After patient care.Added soap additives (improved soap or antimicrobial soap) confer killing activity to the practice of hand washing.
As a felony procedure, it may be required to perform surgery or in arrangements in high-risk antibiotic resistant organs.
You have to remove all the microbes.
This procedure requires washing hands and arms up to the elbow, usually in 2-6 minutes.
Long-term (10-minute) hand washing is not necessary.
When washing, deep-faced water should be prevented from returning to the hands.
After hand-washing is over, the hands are dried with a cleansing cloth and a medical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of the germ, it is best to wash hands or use a hand sanitizer before and after watching a sick person.
In order to control infections in hospitals, it has been found that the biggest benefit of hand-washing was in the initial 20%, and that there was very little benefit when hand-washing numbers rose to 35%.
Conventional soap is three times more likely to result in the average number of infections transmitted through eating compared to hand washing and antibacterial soaps.Comparing hand washing with alcohol-contained and hand washing with antibacterial soaps for a 30-second rate shows that hand-cleaning alcohol reduced bacterial contamination by 26%, with more than 26% of antibacterial soaps.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand sanitizers to reduce H1N1 influenza.Virus and fungal bacterial Clostridium in the hands.Practices to improve hand hygiene can improve health care hand hygiene for the washing team, increasing the availability of alcohol hand sanitizer, and ordering and scheduling teams.
More research is needed to determine which practices are most effective in different healthcare interventions.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as an essential tool for achieving good health, and even good nutrition.
However, a lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, in schools and in the workplace, made it a challenge to provide universal hand washing practices.
For example, in most of Africa hand washing taps near public or private toilets are not available, although there are cheap options for the production of hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates can also be the result of a high-quality habit due to lack of soap or water.
Increasing and advocating hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions and increase awareness about the benefits of hand washing and lead to long-term behavior in the population.
In order for this to work effectively, surveillance and evaluation are necessary.
A review system led to 70 scientific studies showing that social methods are more effective than improving hand washing in LMICs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective.An example of the increase in school handwashing by UNICEF is the three-star route, which encourages schools to take, for example, cheap steps to ensure that students are getting other handwashing and sanitizing facilities.
When the lowest standards are recorded, schools can vary from one to three stars.
Building hand washing stations can be part of hand washing campaigns that are being implemented to reduce disease and child mortality.
International Handwashing Day is another example of the Handwashing Consciousness Campaign that is trying to change behavior, as a result of the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has published a handwashing emoji.
Some studies have determined the cost of hand washing in developing countries in relation to DALY is excluded.
However, one review suggests that extending hand washing with soap is more effective than other water and sanitation products.
The effect of hand washing on human health - especially for people in vulnerable situations such as mothers who had given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals - was first identified in the 19th century by two hand hygiene finders: the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria and Florence Nightingale, a modern English nursing finder.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were the cause of the dirty smells we call miasmas.
In the 1980s, foodborne illnesses and communicable diseases associated with infection led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prefer the use of hand washing as a cutting-edge way to prevent the transmission of infection.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have led to increased awareness of the importance of hand washing with soap in many countries to protect individuals from infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "correct hand washing techniques" were hanged next to hand washrooms in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The phrase "washing hands" means declaring a healthy person to bear the responsibility for the thing or be involved in it.
This comes from the biblical passage in Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a very common phrase in some English communities.
In Shakespeare’s Macbeth, Macbeth begins to wash her hands in an attempt to cleanse a contaminated idea, representing a sense of guilt that she had committed and persuaded her husband to commit.
It has been found that people, after having the idea of immoral acts, tend to wash their hands more often than others, and tend to wash their hands more often than others.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after deep contemplation are less likely to engage in other cleansing practices, such as volunteering.
Religions describe hand washing for both purposes of sanitation and hygiene such as simbolism, simplicity, the use of hand washing, and not the use of soap to wash hands, are part of the tradition of washing hands in zodiacs, such as the Baha'i Faith, Hinduism, Tevila, and Christianity in Judaism, and Lava Islam.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam mandate washing of hands after the toilet.
In addition, Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, Jewish, and Islam mandate washing of hands before and after eating.
Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19
Operational hazard controls for COVID-19 are the application of safety and health measures to control hazards for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
Proper hazard controls in the workplace depend on the workplace and the task, based on risk exposure to sources of work, severity of disease in the community, and risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the OSHA Health and Safety Administration, less exposure to workplace hazards is less related to the general public and to workers at the company, so basic infection protection measures have been announced, including hand washing and encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick or have respiratory problems, and routine cleaning and anti-infection of the work environment.
Medium-risk jobs include those requiring close contact with people who are unknown or suspected of having COVID-19, but who may be infected due to social transmission or international travel.
This includes workers who have relationships with the general public such as schools, high-level working environments of the knowledgeable industry, and some high-level flight arrangements.
Hazard controls for this group, as well as basic infection prevention measures, which include ventilation with advanced air filters, scalp protection, and the presence of special protective equipment if someone has COVID-19.
OSHA considers health-care workers and mortuary workers at high risk of contracting COVID-19, and the risk is very high if the worker uses an air-conditioner or collects specimens suspected or suspected of COVID-19.
Appropriate hazard controls for workers involved in engineering work such as negative pressure air exchange rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for the task.
The spread of COVID-19 can have many impacts on the workplace.
Workers may be out of work because they are at risk of becoming sick and need to take care of others or because of an infection.
Traders may change the demand for the goods they require and the means of acquiring the goods (such as marketing when people come to the market or deliver or sell on-the-go).
Recently, cargo ships in geographic areas affected by COVID-19 may be stopped.A preparedness for infection and response plan may be used to conduct safety measures.
Plans publish risk levels related to the work placement of the virus and its tasks, including sources of infection and adjustment of risk factors at home and in the community, and individual risk factors such as old age or chronic disease.
They also summarize necessary controls to address risks and emergency plans for situations that may escalate the outbreak.
Infectious disease preparedness and planning may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
Objectives for responding to an outbreak include reducing the spread within the team and protecting people who are at high risk of health complications and reducing the impact of other diagnoses in their range of contributions.
The severity of the disease in the community that the business is affected is also taking over the responses.
Increasing damage controls is a widely used idea in the safety and security practices for the group of hazard controls by the activity.
When COVID-19 hazards cannot be controlled, the most effective controls are engineering controls followed by administrative controls and personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls include the removal of workers from hazards without relying on worker behavior, and can be the most proactive solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in procedures or procedures that require action by workers.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering controls and administrators, but can help prevent infections for a while.
All types of PPE should be selected depending on the harm to workers, properly proportionately as applicable (e.g., respiratory problems), consistent and appropriate warning, legally enforced, peer-reviewed, replaced, as needed, deemed to be removed, cleaned, stored or disposed of to avoid pollution.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), lower risk exposures have less to do with the general public and employees of the company.
The basic prevention methods of infection recommended that all workplaces wash their hands too often and encourage workers to stay at home if they had respiratory problems that included coughing and sneezing, providing tissues and dust sheets, preparing for remote contact or shaft exchange if necessary, warning workers not to use tools and hand sanitizers and hand sanitizers.
Identification and isolation of infected people is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that workers who have symptoms of home-preserved illness stay at least as long as they are rescued from the pandemic, symptoms of the pandemic and any other symptoms of at least 24 hours of stay-at-home care, without using medications to alleviate or otherwise treat the illness, and then be able to take care of the sick, stay home.
According to OSHA, the risk of intermediary jobs include those with more or less six feet long (1.8m) contact with people who are not carriers or suspected COVID-19, but who may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to community transmission or because the individual has international travel to a location with COVID-19.
Estes incluem trabalhadores que trabalham com precárias e precários, como as escolas, os ambientes de trabalho industrial e os equipamentos de protecção, a engenharia de tais e de grupos de alto risco, a instalação de ventiladores, e a instalação de equipamentos de vigilância, e a instalação de protocolos de vigilância.
Workers in this dangerous group are rarely asked to use their respirators.
If a person is sick at an airport, appropriate controls can be exercised to protect workers and travelers who are separating the sick person from others by a length of 6 feet and assigning one of the group to watch the sick person by offering a face mask to the sick person or requesting a mouth guard and nose of the sick person with tissues when he grabs or sniffs.
This group of workers should wear protective gloves when dealing with a sick traveler or touching body fluids or contaminated surfaces and adding personal protective equipment if the sick traveler has fever or persistent cough or acute respiratory distress.
Handbags and protective equipment should be prepared in plastic bags, and dirty surfaces should be cleaned and sterilized. For commercial markets, including malls and passenger ships, hazard controls for delaying travel when sick or quarantined, and a direct medical center if someone else has them.
Ideally, medical treatment should be carried out in the quarantined person's vicinity.For schools and childcare facilities, CDC recommends short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person has been in a school building in light of the social spread.
When there are fewer attempts to minimize social mobility, social distancing measures can be applied such as travel cancellations and gatherings and other large gatherings such as medical education or religious gatherings or dining in coffee shops, increased periods between tables and adjustment of travel, and student rest and restriction of non-essential travel and the use of an office space for nursing children who have symptoms.
When there is significant dissemination in the local community, in addition to social distancing measures, extended school holidays may be considered.For the executive branch law implementing daily routine activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officials who must contact persons who are infected or suspected of having COVID-19 are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical techniques, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during a hazardous situation, workers must clean and disinfect their vehicle's gear and back to reuse, using household cleansing wipes and hand sanitizers, and using standard procedures for cleaning, reducing the use of PPE and for cleaning and washing clothes.
OSHA assures health-care workers and death rooms that pose a high risk.
High-risk jobs include health care, support, laboratory and medical transportation for workers who are known or suspected to have COVID-19.
These workers are at high risk if they use air-conditioning machines or collect samples from patients who are or are suspected of COVID-19.
Diagnostic procedures such as intravenous thrombocytopenia, cochlear stimulation, pneumonia, some dental procedures, testing or collecting samples.
High risk of working in dead rooms Workers who work for those who have contracted COVID-19 at the time of their death; these workers are at high risk if they have an autopsy; engineering controls added to these risk groups provide quarantine rooms for patients who are infected or suspected of COVID-19, when transfusion devices are used.
Negative air pressure monitors may be appropriate in some health care settings and deaths.
Samples need to be worked on with a Level 3 Tectonic Inspector.
The World Health Organization (WHO) warns patients to stay away while waiting for the test of suspected cases of COVID-19.
In the United States, NIOSH filtered N95 masks or better should be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that includes respiratory tests, training, and medical tests.
Other respirators provide greater protection and development for workers.The World Health Organization does not recommend medical uniforms, such as COVID-19 respiratory diseases, but they are transmitted through liquid substances.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends only a surgical mask for screening teams.
For those who accumulate respiratory specimens to look after and transport COVID-19 patients without an air-exchange device, the WHO recommends a surgical mask, goggles, face shield, and gloves.
If a respirator is used, the surgical mask is replaced with N95 or FFP2.
In light of the widely accepted PPE standard, the WHO recommends reducing the need for PPE to send information, covering medical issues such as windows, allowing only those with direct contact with care to enter the COVID-19 patient's room, using only PPE supplies for specific tasks, continuing to use the same respiratory apparatus without disconnecting from follow-up care.

Date and time: 14/03/2020 00:24.
Licence: CCO: No rights are secure.
We see ourselves in a certain circumstance this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic is something that makes global social contact and the responsibilities we have to one another impossible.
We don’t have a precedent for its challenges, but we know that our best response relies on the empathy, cooperation and community building that will be the most important part of this organization.
The sense of empathy and self-awareness that we have shared with all of our friends through email, phone calls and chats is an incredible contribution to humanity that we're delighted to share with.
I couldn't be more grateful and happy to have you as colleagues.
Last week, some people shared with me their condolences for our work.
They reminded me of how meaningful it is for the world to go to Wikipedia right now, and it's some powerful symbols that will continue to be an online resource that's available to everyone.
Your work makes it possible, whether you keep our site persistent or our colleagues' wages, or whether you keep our communities safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, now more than ever.
Now is not just the time to do what we do, but how we do it, which will make a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we're going to make some very important adjustments about how we work together, starting this week.
Settings for our work and schedules
As Robin mentioned above, last night the C-team met to discuss our strategy and schedule for the next few days and months.
In that conversation, we considered that our ideas would become an important response to what we're facing and the best way to sustain the organization during this time.
On a very large scale, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our mission for the long term.
If you need a little reduction, it's okay.
For all the team, contractors, contractors:
Our day-to-day work would be about four hours, or 20 hours a week at most.
We’re not taking a break — if you’re able to work more normal hours, the mission can use you.
Anyway, the world is in an unpredictable state right now, and whether you need to look after loved ones, go to a medical clinic or go to the doctor, your health is our most important thing.
We're not wasting your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
That should be done without saying it, but we're saying it.
No sick days or timetables are required, just call your manager and help your team change schedules and schedules to make sure the work area is managed properly.
(If you have COVID-19, please tell Bryan from the T&C Ops team, T&C can help you with support and make sure your situation is properly monitored by management)
People will be fully paid for every hour.
We have already said and reiterated it with pride in our commitments to our contractors and our working colleagues.
Everyone is paid based on their normal working hours during normal circumstances.
This includes those who are sick or unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to relieve the stress of the world around us.
What we can do is unbelievable reward, especially during periods like this.
Again, this is about self-care.
Our request is that you speak to your manager, so we know what to expect and what we can adjust accordingly.
Some jobs are considered basic.
There are some things that we need to keep doing.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety, Fundraising teams (among others) are doing critical work that may require support.
We're going to start a process with every department to organize our current goals and focus on helping what's essential to our mission.
We all have a lot of work to do, and we're just going to focus on all the more basic projects.
Slowing now won't hurt later.
We're not planning to "double things" once an epidemic has gone.
You're not going to get extra work to get deadlines, which are now unrealistic.
We accept that circumstances have changed, and we work to address new targets and timeframes when they are possible.
What happens with the APP (Annual Planning)?
In order to adjust our current situation and our day-to-day working hours, we are going to need to set up a timeline to deliver our 2020-2021 annual plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that will give us more time to fundraise to allow workers to carry out their most important work, self-care, and care for loved ones while helping those who need to reduce their schedules for the next few weeks.
This add-on schedule greatly reduces current planning workload and puts pressure on all initiatives.
We're introducing our proposal to the council next week and will update exhibitors and teams on the next step when we have confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for leading this.
Office Status, Threat and Cleanup
Last week, we learned that one of our FS-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, without much caution, we set up a virus-cleaning team to clean up all the surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used a hospital antiviral drink to cleanse all surfaces, as well as the waiting hall and elevators in our rooms.
The building is hiring its own duty-of-health protection that supports the safety of their tenants.
We feel comfortable that the office will be well-prepared for when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located at WeWork, which has given us the medical guidelines for COVID-19 and all DC staff members.
And last week, our DC office moved to a full-fledged safe-line setup, as published in San Francisco.
As some of our NYS-based friends know, we're in talks to hire a location in Brooklyn.
These conversations go on, but they may be delayed.
Some of our friends are working from home, for the first time.
Our long-time home-working employees know that it can be adjustable, and we wanted to offer you some advice:
Limit the duration of visits to more than one or two hours of work.
If long-term meetings are required, consider how they will end within a few days.
Speak clearly of the meeting, have an agenda, and send reading materials in advance.
Describe the problems with video, using tools like Google Docs and Xoom to facilitate live collaboration and communication.
Set a leader to facilitate all meetings, someone to monitor your chat for questions and record a list of speakers, and someone to help take notes (or contribute to feedback).
Send an e-mail to tech support if you need a comfortable stereo.
Use your pet’s healthy crust for meals.
Join the static channels to talk with your employees about distributed work.
The HR team is seeking guidance in the field of electronic work science to assist in the growth of collaborative work within the organization.
This past week, we called on all recipient-giving organizations to reject all publicly available Wikimedia aid events, such as editing information, until the WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We tell them that we understood that our request for rejection and other restrictions could make it impossible to complete their donation activity, and that no one would be penalized for postponing or changing those goals.
This coming week, we will follow up with additional guidance on Wikimedia and other regional and thematic conferences.
Public empathy from across the globe seems to be contrived by the disruption of the situation, but also comforted by the ability to focus on their communities, Wikipedia, and vice versa.
Going forward, the CRT is working to set up a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a range to the organization to monitor the impact and share our communications with them.
Staying at work on COVID-19-related issues
We will send an invitation to your calendar at Thursday at 14:00 UTC or 07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions and spend some time communicating with each other.
We're in this together and we're here to help as many as we can.
In time, we can continue to find the information in this email, and all the basic information related to COVID-19, on Wikiworks.
CRT keeps these pages and information updated in one place.
And we're also working to maintain legal relations with employees that are settled in countries that are currently being affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a median type of work or challenge, or anything else you may need help with, please don’t hesitate to talk to and work with the CRT.
We are here to help provide support and assistance as needed.
If you have a secret or sensitive issue, please email Brin – Director of Global HR Practice.
None of these changes should be seen as abandoning our work and obligations.
Rather, they're forgetting that at this point, our work and flexibility are needed to fit in a situation that we didn't exist before.
These are the steps that we believe are necessary to support one another, so we can continue to work, provide with our support that they need, and with the world service that they rely on.
Our planned work will be done on time.
For now, it's time to help one another and to create space for important work that will take place in the coming days and months.
We need all of you to do that, and so we need all of you to take care of yourself and your families so you can be at your best when you need it.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katerine, the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen-D, Gergory V, James V, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and other team leaders (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen V, U, Lisa S, Ryan, and Toby N)
An angiotensin-2 (ACE2) enzyme is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membrane) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 inhibits the cortical-linked angiotensin-enzyme (ACE) enzyme by reducing dysentery and increasing Ang(1-7) to a promiscuous drug is expected to treat heart disease. It also benefits ACE2 as a gateway to entry into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensis is a dual angiotensin synthesis of a metallic zinc found on the surface of the inner tubes and other cells.
ACE2 proteins include the N region peptidase peptide M2 transducer and the C-separated transceiver amino acid.
ACE is a unique type of I-protein, with its actuated enzyme held on the surface of cells in the lungs and also other tissues.
The extraction of the main cell from ACE2 is transmitted from the main protein, a pyrite enzyme, and it becomes a polarized protein inside the blood stream, and it becomes exponentially dissociated and depleted.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane, specifically the lung type II cells, cells in the narrow intestine, the lining of artery and artery cells, and muscle-shaped artery cells in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the prefrontal cortex, in the central brain, in the deep brain, and in the cerebral cortex.
The primary function of ACE2 is to balance the scale of ACE.
ACE binds angiotensin hormone to angiotensin II within the blood vessel.
ACE2 inserts carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angotensin II (Asp-Arg-Bal-IIe-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses into the vasodilator angiotensin (1 - 7, H-Asp-Arg-His-Lyr).
ACE2 can also bind to a number of other peptides such as[des-Arg9]bradykinin, apelin neurotensin, dynorp hin A, ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the soluble amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been found in Hartnap disease.
As a transporter protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, such as HcoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More precisely, the combination of the S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 into the ACE2 enzymatic dominance on the surface of cells results in the alteration of both the virus and the enzyme into the endosome that resides within the cell.
It is believed that reducing ACE2 levels in the cell may help fight the disease.
However, some professional groups and body regulators have suggested that standardized ACE reduction and ARB therapy should be continued.
A meta-analysis published on March 11, 2020 found that "use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of developing symptoms compared to control."
Moreover, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at higher risk for pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors has been associated with modification of pneumonia-related pneumonia, although the results were less healthful than the overall risk of pneumonia.
Human recombination ACE2 (rhACE2) is thought to be a new treatment for acute lung injury, and has emerged to increase lung hemorrhage and oxygen deficiency in pigs with lipopolysaccharide-a successive symptom of acute respiratory distress.
The half-life of ErhACe in humans is about 10 hours, with an impulsivity of 30 minutes in addition to the effect of 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for people with pre-existing angiotensin protease (RAS) inhibitors or who have been examined for treatment in the medical field for acute pneumonia.
BCOVID 19 applications are mobile applications designed to help track people in contact with the 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak, for example by identifying persons (connections) who may have been in contact with an infected person.
Numerous applications were developed and made available, with official government support in some areas and jurisdictions.
Some fundamentals of the work to build connection, tracking applications have been developed.
Privacy concerns have been raised, especially about systems that are grounded to track the geographical location of app users.
Less intrusive personal contacts and steps such as using Bluetooth signals to enter and access the person and to other mobile phones.
On 10 March 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would be signing up to support Bluetooth-enabled apps that would run fully on Android and iOS.
In China, the Chinese government, together with Alipay, has developed an app that allows citizens to check whether they have been with people who have been infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 cities in China.In Singapore, a program called TraceTogether is being used.
The program has been developed by the IT community, open-sourced and will soon be shut down by the government.The North Macedonian startup "Stop Corona" is a bluetooth program aimed at finding infected people and providing a prompt response to the healthcare industry.
The app has been developed by the Ministry of Transportation and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of 14 April 2020, the app was on the verge of getting confirmation from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government announced that the Pushback app was at its latest growth target, and would be ready for use within a week.A similar one is planned in Ireland and France ("Stop COVID-19").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering a Singaporean follow-up program and Bluetooth protocol.Russia plans to introduce a location-tracking program for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and living in Moscow, designed to make sure those patients do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, security engineer at the University of Cambridge, identified some of the potential pitfalls associated with systems, including false positives and the potential lack of effectiveness if the application functionality is limited to a small minority of the population.
Addressing concerns about the spread of the harmful or loss of "coronavirus" apps, Apple has set limits on the types of organizations that will add the same-sex coronavirus to the App Store, limiting it only to "official" or otherwise to well-known organizations.
Google and Amazon have co-imposed a similar ban.
Private attackers have expressed concern over the issues involved in monitoring the use of the coronavirus program, in particular about whether infrastructure surveillance created to deal with the coronavirus outbreak would be disintegrated once the threat was over.
Amnesty International and 100 organizations announced a call for restrictions on this type of scrutiny.
The organizations declared eight conditions on government projects:
Attention would have to be "full-law. Necessary and equal."
Excess of surveillance and scrutiny would have to be after sunshine;
The use of data should be limited to the cause of COVID-19;
the data security and anonymity must be protected and substantiated by evidence that is secure;
Digital monitors should avoid worsening discrimination and exclusion;
any distribution of data to third parties should be explained in the rules;
There must be security men to respond to the abuse and protect the rights of their citizens;
Meaningful participation is required by all "relevant creditors," including public health experts and vulnerable groups.The German Catechism Computer Society (CCC) and RSF have also issued false statements.
Google and Apple's proposed plan had been to address the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the monitoring mechanism from mobile operating systems when it was no longer needed.
Some countries use location-based internet instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download an app, and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, the Internet of Surveillance was approved.
Based Internet-based solutions for access to remote location data have rigorous privacy-preserving problems.
However, not all systems and central servers need to have access to personal location data; a number of privacy-preserving systems have been created that only use central servers to communicate with each other (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used to process contact tracing.
Instead of using a specific application, the system collected tracked data from a variety of sources, such as mobile device monitoring data and card processing data, and combined these to make a note of text messages to potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential connections, the government has also made available the location of the information to the public, something allowed for remote access due to changes made to data privacy laws after the MERS collapse in that country.
This information is available to the public via a number of apps and websites.Countries like Germany have approved that they use both centralization and privacy protection systems.
As of April 6, 2020, the details had not yet been revealed.
Privacy surveillance is a good idea to establish, with a large body of literature research dating back to at least 2013.On April 7, 2020, more than a group of experts are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
However, PEPP-PT is an optimization opportunity that contains both a centralized and an uncollective medium, and is not a protocol. DP-PPT/D-3T Protokolls include peer-to-peer monitoring of features (DP-PPT/D-3t), interconnected numbers (TCN), interconnected numbers, incident ratios (fka), performance measures, and CPT processes.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never leaves the device, and all matching happens on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab has been developing "Security Pathways," a platform for the use of privacy-preserving techniques when collecting and using location or routed data to monitor the spread of COVID-19.

A COVID-19 vaccine is a predictable vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are many advanced attempts to develop a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not anticipate vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, a pathogenic virus, to become available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were selected in Phase I safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in March 2020.
A number of outbreaks have occurred worldwide in 2020, prompting investment and research to develop a vaccine.

In April, the main requirements of the CEPI initiative for vaccine development were announced to include speed, manufacturing capability, equipment, and global accessibility.
In March, CEPI scientists announced that 10 different platform technologies were under research and development during early 2020 to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Many platforms have advanced targets in 1 research areas, including:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase 1 Developer and Vaccine Selected: moderna, mRNA-1273)
An adenovirus (Centro 1 Developer and Selective Vaccine): a synthetic cannino (CanSino Biologicals), an adenovirus (Adenovirus) of type 5.
As reported by CEPI scientists in March, a total of 115 vaccines were selected in the early stages of development, and 78 were approved as active projects (79 according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others were announced, but with little public information available (which is planned or planned).
A Phase 1-2 trial provides initial safety and disease-resistant testing, typically tested, controlling harmless drugs and in both directions, while selecting medications in a more accurate, effective manner.
Phase 3 trials typically involve more participants, including a control group and testing of vaccine effectiveness to prevent a disease while monitoring the adverse effects at a food dose.
Of the 79 vaccines selected in active development (established in early March 2020), 74 were not in human evaluation (still in study).

Some vaccines have different effects, also called undetectable effects.
This means they can have benefits after preventing the disease.
An enhanced randomized trial in Australia is looking to enroll 4,170 healthcare workers.
Vaccines in development may not be safe or effective.
Early research to determine vaccine efficacy uses COVID-19 samples in specific animals, such as intravenous genetic mice (ACE2), a provision for Level 3 biosafety measures to deal with live viruses, international management to ensure safety standards.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal samples.
As of 2020, there is no treatment or protective vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of novel vaccines and medicines for the treatment of SARS was of paramount importance to governments and public health agencies around the world.There is also no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS became a common disease, it was believed that the presence of SARS research might provide a useful template for developing vaccines and therapeutics against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one MERS-based DNA vaccine that completed Phase 1 clinical trials in humans, and three other advances, all directed virus vaccines, two of which were directed adenoviruses (ChAdOx1-MERS and BVRS-GamVac), MVA-directed and unified.
Media outlets have published an antiviral design behind COVID-19 that a vaccine was previously known to have been available.
The inventions have been made possible by reference to viral publications on social media due to the invention of genetic practices and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus such as SARS coronavirus.
B-CoV disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time when the first symptoms typically appear is around five days but may range from two to 14 days.
While most cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to pneumonia and two organs.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, causing more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered.The virus is particularly transmissible between people during close contact, often due to small respiratory droplets caused by coughing, sneezing, and talking.
While these droplets are produced when breathing, they usually fall to the ground or on surfaces rather than being infected at long distances.
People may also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most transmissible within the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread may be possible before symptoms appear or in later stages of the disease.The standard method of diagnosis is to retrieve the correct timing of the polymer chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in a nasopharyngeal swab.
The use of masks is recommended for those suspected of having the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations for the use of masks by individuals in general vary, some governments recommend against their use, some recommend their use, and others recommend their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or special treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries of the six WHO regions.
Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or have flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, dizziness, difficulty waking up, and bluish facial expressions or lips: immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.
Less commonly, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, colds, or sore throats may be seen.
Neurological symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed in studies.
Some cases in China initially only reported chest stiffness and rapid heartbeats.
In some, the disease may develop into pneumonia, damage to two organs, and death.
This is called the period of onset of symptoms.
Five to six days can range from two to 14 days.
So within 11.5% of the day of infection, reports indicate that not all those infected develop symptoms.
The role of asymptomatic carriers in transmission of the virus is not yet fully known, although preliminary evidence suggests they may be the cause of the disease’s spread.
The proportion of infected individuals who do not display symptoms is currently unknown and being investigated, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their hospital stay.
China's National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April: 166 infections on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both saliva and saliva can carry high viral loads.
Loud talk drops more droplets than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that uncoated coughing can transport droplets up to 4.5 metres (15 feet) away.
Although the virus is not generally airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that biological airborne transmission may be possible, or ventilators through the passage of people's rooms will create a positive example of viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as intravenous bronchitis and cardiac and pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory failure to become airborne and thus become airborne.
While there are theories that it may spread through the face, this risk has been underestimated.The virus is most contagious when people are symptomatic; while spread may occur before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that while it is not generally clear how quickly the disease spreads, one person infects another two to three.The virus survives for several hours to days on surfaces.
Specifically, the virus has been found to be detectable for up to a day on cartons, for more than three days on plastic (polymers of thermally insoluble) and pure steel, and for up to four hours on 99% copper.
However, heavy loads depend on the humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if used properly, soap products break the viral fat protection levels, deactivating them, as well as releasing them on other skin and surfaces.
Other treatments, such as chemical detergents and anti-inflammatory agents (anti-inflammatory creams), are less effective.In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken on a two-day basis after the start of hospitalization.
In five of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day of testing.
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SAR-CoV-2) is a new severe acute respiratory syndrome virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia linked to acute respiratory distress syndrome cases in Wuhan.
All features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble.SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus enters the host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the most common of the 2 types of alveolar cells in the lungs.
The virus uses a specific surface of a virus called a "peplomer" to bind to ACE2 and how it enters the host cell.
Acute heart failure was found in 12% of infected people admitted to hospital in Wuhan, China, and is more frequent in severe patients.
Rates of symptoms of cardiovascular disease are high, leading to systemic arrhythmia and immune system disorder, but heart muscle damage may be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are high in the heart and are expressed in heart function.
A high incidence of blood clots (31%) and vascular fibrosis (25%) have been found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections and may be related to inability to recover.Several analyses of people who have died of COVID-19 have been shown to contain alveolar alveolar damage and lymphatic inflammation in the lung.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has a progenitor for ACE2 cells that excrete epithelial respiratory tract, patients infected with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic infection.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF T-cells have been shown to correlate filling IL-6-secreting infections and severe lung disease in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocyte-derived agents were also reported in the anatomy.
The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard way to test is to test the contraceptive polymer chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is typically performed on respiratory samples obtained from a nasopharyngeal sample; however, a nasopharyngeal sample or pus sample may be used.
Results are generally available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but they require two blood samples taken two weeks apart and the results are of immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of coronavirus and spread its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymer chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection with the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which may detect active infections and if someone has already been infected) have been in development, but still not widely used.
The Chinese experience with testing has shown that accuracy is only 60 to 70 percent.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care test on 21 March 2020 for use at the end of that month.Diagnostic guidelines published by Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University suggested ways to identify infections based on clinical trends and epidemiological risk.
Double-glazed wall panels with slopes, asymmetries and delays are common in the early infection.
Respiratory control, radiation imaging (malignant in the lungs with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.
Few information is available about microscopic harms and family asymmetries in COVID-19.
The most common pathological findings in anatomy are:
Muscles: pneumonia, arthritis, lung consolidation, and pneumonia
The four severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
Mild pneumonia: abdominal anemia, pneumonia, large abnormal pneumonia, intermittent inflammation with the lymphocytes and large cell structure.
Severe pneumonia: alveolar prevalence (DAD) damage with excreted avowalitis.
DAD causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe blood oxygen deficiency.
Healing pneumonia: excreted organs in alveolar cavities and pulmonary canals.
Blood: angiogenesis of intravenous secretions (DIC): low response of red blood cells.
Ways to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water and for 20 seconds, practicing proper respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a wrist when coughing or sneezing, and recommends using the anesthetic if the hand is not available.
Proper hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is recommended.
The CDC has recommended using cloth face coverings in public places, to limit transmission from asymptomatic people.The goal of social distancing is to reduce contact with infected individuals in large groups by closing schools and workplaces, stopping travel, and cancelling large public gatherings.
Distant guidelines also include that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8m) apart.
No medical treatment has been found to be effective in preventing COVID-19.As a vaccine is not expected until early 2021, an important part of managing CODIV-19 efforts to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as "nodding the curve".
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands with soap and water for 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after nailing, coughing or sneezing.
It further recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer of at least 60% alcohol, but only when water and soap are not available.For areas where hand sanitizer is not available, the WHO provides two rules for local production.
In these rules, antibiotic activity increases from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help remove bacterial spores in alcohol; it is "not an active substance for hand antiseptic".
Glycerin has been added as a moisturizer.
People are administered with supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support for other infected organs.
The CDC recommends that those suspected of carrying the virus wear a simple mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene, a healthy lifestyle and nutrition have been shown to improve immunity.
Supportive treatments may be useful in people with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection.The WHO and Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations to look after people in hospitals affected by COVID-19.
U.S. physicians and lung scientists have compiled treatment recommendations from virus agencies on a free resource, IBCC.
As of March 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol above ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautions should be made to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus, especially health care facilities when performing procedures that can generate aerosols, such as insertion of air pipes or hand ventilation.
For healthcare professionals looking after people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing an airborne person in an isolated room (AIIR) as well as using standard airborne alerts, a communications and airborne alerts provider. The CDC plans guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Recommended materials: PPE clothing, respirator or face mask, eye protection, and medical gloves. When available, respirators (instead of face masks) are preferred.
N95 ventilators are approved for industrial settings, but the FDA has allowed masks to be used under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect airborne particles like dust, but their effectiveness against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for their non-verifiable use.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face shields, or homemade masks, as the last item.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so severe that they require ventilation or exchange, but a percentage of them are.
Types of respiratory assistance for people with COVID-19 associated with shortness of breath are actively being studied for people in hospital, with some evidence that the use of respiratory tubes can be avoided with nasopharyngeal tubes or positive air pressure.
Whether either of the two has the same benefits for at-risk people is unknown.
Some doctors will agree to stay with rapid ventilation if available, as this method limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to nasal tyres.Strong cases are more common in older people (those over 60, especially those over 80).
In many developed countries, hospitalizations do not require hospitalizations for every patient, limiting the health system's ability to control the acute surge in the number of coronavirus-infected people who need to remain in hospital.
A study in China found that 5% were allowed to be in care settings, 2.3% needed medical support for ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, nearly 30% of people hospitalized for COVID-19 are eventually admitted to an ICU.
Ventilation becomes more complicated due to the development of acute respiratory distress symptoms (ARDS) in COVID-19 and the oxidation process becomes extremely difficult.
Ventilators are capable of pressure control modes and high PEEP are required to increase oxygen delivery while reducing the risk of ventilation associated with lung injury and pneumonia.
High PEEP may not be available in older ventilators.
Research into advanced treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Antiviral drugs are believed to be the most successful.
Although new treatments may take up to 2021 to be developed, many other approved treatments are approved for other uses or in advanced testing.
Antiviral therapy may be tested in people with severe disease.
The WHO has recommended volunteers participate in trials of safety and efficacy treatments.The FDA has granted temporary authorization for plasma remission as an experimental treatment in cases where a person's life is at risk either by force or directly.
It doesn’t have the required clinical research experience to show the disease’s effectiveness and safety.
In March 2020, China launched a mobile app to reduce the spread of the disease.
Participants are asked to register their name and ID number.
The app is able to detect "close contact" using surveillance data and has a higher risk of infection.
Every user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential threat is detected, the app not only recommends self-isolation at home, but also alerts local health officials.Several analytics data on mobile data, facial recognition technology, and artificial intelligence mobile phone location tracking are used to track infected people and people contacted in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled security agencies to process mobile data on people who are believed to have coronaviruses.
The method was used to enforce quarantine and protect those who might interact with infected people.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared a mobile app with the German Federal Government's Robert Koch School to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has developed the facial recognition technology to identify those who break quarantines.
Italian regional peacekeeping unit Giulio Gallera said he was informed by mobile operators that "40 percent of people continue to move in any way."
The German government announced the 48-hour Hawson weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
The president of Estonia, Christie Cleveland, also declared the global telephone intelligently against the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may experience depression as a result of quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of medication or fear of infection.
Beese quoted Roy O'Corner as saying, "More than social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, depression and recession are an absolute stream of harm to internal health and well-being."
The disease may take a moderate course with few or no symptoms, like any other respiratory illnesses, such as the common cold.
Moderate cases typically recover within two weeks, while severe or severe cases take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women are more likely to become infected with the more severe COVID-19 epidemic, with data from other related viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is inadequate.In the United States, COVID-19 may cause lung disease.
In severe cases, COVID-19 may rapidly transition to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory dysfunction, oxygen deficiency or greater organ lag.
Correlations with COVID-19 include organ failure, hemorrhage and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Hyperglycemia, specifically contributing to an increase in prothrombin time, is described in 6% of those being administered to hospitalization with COVID-19, while abnormal kidney function is seen in 4% of the population.
Approximately 20-30% of people who are infected with COVID-19 transmit their enzymes.
According to the same report, the average time between the first symptoms and death on the 10th day was extended, with five being targeted.
However, patients transferred to an ICU had a median time of seven days for new deaths and stays.
In a study of early cases, the average time from the initial symptoms to death was 14 days, with a range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) in China, the male mortality rate was 2.8% while the female mortality was 1.7%.
A study of changes to the post-mortem C-mortem study showing the spread of alveolar pyrite alveolar (above human pyrite alveolar) may result in the deterioration of the seolar fabricomixide (animal host) in the two lungs.
The reproductive stem cell songs were observed in the neonicocytes cells.
LVirus C showed severe acute CCD (ARDS) syndrome.
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage has been noted at high levels of protein or cardiac arrest.
According to July data from the United States, 89 percent of those admitted to hospitals were people with pre-existing conditions.Preparation for medical and social economics in a region may also affect mortality.
Mortality statistics vary by state because of the differences between the regions themselves, but also because of their geological complexity.
The count of moderate cases can be a factor in overestimating mortality.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of those infected in the past, and the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to be infected with severe COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care than non-smokers.Smokers are concerned about the long-term outcome of the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Government has found a dose of 20 to 30 for lung capacity in some people who have recovered from the disease, and lung organ damage.
This may also lead to subsequent medical care for recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether or not the infected individuals had developed active and round-the-clock immunity in people who recovered from the disease.
Immunity can be seen as such, with respect to the behavior of other viruses, but other cases that have recovered from COVID-19 are highlighted by positive test results from the coronavirus that have been detected in several days.
These cases are believed to worsen with long-term contagion than with reinfection.
The virus is thought to be natural and animal-based, from Spiver’s disease.
The initial origins are unknown, but as of December 2020, the outbreak was largely caused by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in December 2020 in Lansett, is the earliest date of onset of symptoms 1 December 2019.
Official publications by the WHO reported that the initial symptoms were December 8, 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to count the cases of death.
These numbers vary by region and time and are impacted by the size of the test, health system quality, treatment options, time from early onprevalence and population characteristics such as age, sex, overall health.
At the end of 2019, the WHO enrolled anesthesia with the ICD code U07.1 for males in the lab and Pei determined the tuberculosis of SARS-KOV-2 and U07.1 for males in the medical unit or in the immunoassay of COVID-19 without the presence of the lab SARS-CoV-2 infected.
According to Johns Hopkins University, the global death rate is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
The number varies by region, other measures such as the case fatality rate (CFR), which represent the number of people diagnosed to have died from a disease, and the number of infected people (IFR), which represents the number of infected people (diagnosed or undiagnosed) who have died from the disease.
These calculators are not time-driven and follow a specific infected population when making case judgments.
While not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may provide information about how many people are infected.
In the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 people, 80 (1.7%) died.
In Ganglet, the disease spread through the Carnival Festival, and spread to younger people, causing a lower mortality rate, and not all COVID-19 deaths may have been classified in this way.
In addition, the German health system has not yet collapsed.
In the Netherlands, three percent have antibodies, which are taken from blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) are confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher in men according to research conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest fear is for men in their fifties.
In China, the death rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
Exact reasons for gender disparity are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors can be a cause.
Based on the science of gender diversity, fewer women are likely to smoke and men with co-morbid conditions such as high blood pressure at a younger age, according to women, may be the reason for higher mortality than men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected people were men and 72% of those who died with COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government is not tracking sex-related data for COVID-19.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
Higher levels of health workers and nurses are especially high, and they have a much better chance of exposure to the virus.
The WHO announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO President Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO is symptomatic to CoV, VI for disease, and 19 for the time of the outbreak it was first identified: 31 December 2019.
The name is chosen by narrowing down specific geographic regions (e.g. China) ...
WHO mainly uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in public conversations.
Both disease and virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV severe contagion as generic names for disease and virus in association with the 2015 Guidelines against location use in disease and disease names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to the size of the barriers according to the Chinese standard, some digital engineers are printing health matters such as throat chairs and ventilator parts.
In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently asked for a ventilator, and the concerned party could not deliver it in time as required, a local start to return the respirator was printed to 100 respiratory requirements per night.
Early in the onset of COVID-19, theoretical, voice-based, misrepresentational and malicious schemes involving the source, measure, prevention, treatment or other aspects of the disease and the rapid spread of COVID-19 across the Internet.
Humans are believed to be capable of transmitting the virus to some animals.
The scientific follow-up failed to find evidence of the virus replicating in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medications or vaccines are approved to treat the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs for COVID-19 is carried out by governmental organizations, academic groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization began evaluating the "SOLIDARITY Trial" lab to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds promising to have an impact.
There’s no vaccine available, but different sides are actively developing an eligible vaccine.
Previous work on SAES-CoV has been literate because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination stars are being monitored.
First, the goal of research is to develop a vaccine for every virus.
The use of such viruses, which are inactive or dead, aims to prompt an immune response of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19.
The second strategy, sub-vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to certain parts of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, these studies focus on the S-spike protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy, is that the nucleus of vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for making a vaccine).
Experimental vaccines from any of these strategies would need to be tested for safety and efficacy.On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine was launched on four volunteers from Seattle.
The vaccine consists of harmless genetic code copied from the virus that caused the disease.Antibody dependent enhancement has been recommended as a major obstacle to vaccine development for 2-SARS-CoV, but this is controversial.
More than 300 active clinical trials are being conducted in April 2020.
Seven tests have been evaluated and treatments have been approved to treat malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
It seems that most of China's research on antiviral drugs, along with nine Phase III trials on redisviral drugs, were reported at the end of April across several countries.
Dysfunctional clinical development to review COVID-19 vaccines and drug candidates is underway, as of February 2020.Presentation of antiviral antibodies to treat COVID-19 has been proposed.Remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lorcaserin antiviral, respectively.
There is provisional evidence for efficacy by remdesivir, as of March 2020.
Improved health outcomes have been seen in patients treated emotionally using remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy.Chloroquine was previously used to treat malaria, studies were being conducted in China in February 2020 with preliminary results.
However, there is a link to reviews for the research.
South Korea and Chinese health officials have recommended using chloroquine. Chloroquinedramin is malaria.[2]
However, the Wuhan Institute for Viral Research, while recommending daily doses of one gram, notes that two doses of the diet can be very dangerous and lethal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA announced that there was an immediate use for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in decision-making and issued a medical treatment for people carrying COVID-19.The seventh Chinese edition of Interferon (the body's natural defense against the virus), rabavirine or amphetamine for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data show that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to protect against SARS-CoV-2 virus.
The drug Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further in vivo investigation after demonstrating low inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.Research has shown that the primary spike protein is inhibited by the 2-muscle protease receptor (TMPRSS2) is essential for entry of SARS-CoV-2 by interacting with the ACE2 receptor.
The trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without antibiotic have strong limits that have prevented the medical community from convincing these treatments without extensive research.Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
The flow of cytokine can be complex in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine effects.The drug Tocilizumab is specified in treatment guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study was completed.
This is a phase of two randomized non-experimental experiments at international level in Italy after showing results in people with severe disease.
Combined with a blood test to diagnose cytokine problem, this means response to improvements, which may lead to death in some infected humans.
The 6-cytokine receptor competition approved by the FDA based on preclinical research to treat steroidal refractory cytokine syndrome is triggered by a severe causal factor, CAR T-2017 therapeutic cell.
To date, there has been no randomized or controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transporter is cleared and the antibodies produced by the immune system of those who have recovered from COVID-19 for those who need them are being tested as a non-vaccinated way of low tolerance.
This procedure was tested for SARS with no results.
Viral neutralization is the anticipated mechanism of action by which a slow-moving antibody can control immunity against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cytotoxicity or functional dysfunction of bacteria, may be possible.
Other forms of invasive antibody therapy, for example, the use of professional monoclonal antibodies in development.
Production of the collection of yellow liquid, consisting of the fluid of the blood proteins of recovered patients, and containing special antibodies to the virus, can be increased for faster spread.
Coronavirus diseases are a group of common symptomatic diseases.
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Hospital Center, who later contracted COVID-19 and died after raising awareness of the spread of the virus.
