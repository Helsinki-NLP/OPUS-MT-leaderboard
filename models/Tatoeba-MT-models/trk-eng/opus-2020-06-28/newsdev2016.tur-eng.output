It's Norway's cricket: is that the world's smell of smell?
Norway's five million people enjoy the highest standard, not just in Europe.
Can the success of the country be connected to local business business that is overly sensitive to the secrets of the country?
Take the history of past cheese.
Put these in the middle of a dirty, stupid football form.
Leave it for a week.
Now you've got one of the big Norwegian tastes that will sleep your nose.
I'm in little Ferenes town, about three hours from Oslo.
There's the snow, the amazing arts, and this smell is always in the air.
Rakfic was salted and water is a subsidiary for how much you love fish, which you love for a year.
When the dark is cool and the air is cool, the Norvers gather here for the most fascinating festival.
The full-time manager and the full-time officer of the Finnish community said, "Rakhy General General of the Earth, then it's a barbecue, and then it's a bar in a bar. "
People around us eat little fish fishes and drink a lot of drinks.
Aird says, "The people like the Aquavrater more than theirs."
It can kill the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can get out of the nose, it's not bad, it's a long bus, and a long way to get on the bus.
Before Ramfik Norvek's iceroom, there's a different difference in the time when the fish are waiting for water, water, and salt.
Then, in the darkness, he'll be taken out of it, and then he'll be re-enacted in the hearts of those who have been created.
Just a generation had been forced to leave the country of Norway to search for work, most of them moved to the United States.
Now it's increasing rapidly, more than 13%, and it's being moved by the high-powered, high-level-speed system.
It's a lot of people who are more rich than Norway than Norway.
Rakfi is representing something important, but it's a part of Norway's history.
Among the most expensive food you can buy.
But everything is worth a small amount of money, or a small amount, or $914 (U.S.).
Norway often doesn't come to global news day, and most people love it.
The people here are still trying to talk about the name of a hundred men, women and children who have killed their child last year.
Instead, it's called "22 July".
The Norwegians have been forced to believe that one of them could be violent and murder like that.
Since Norway's wealth today is under the control of the world, the world's largest oil oil and gas industry is sleeping in one of the most gas stations of the world.
We're not the only reason we're waiting for a waiter.
We are the best nation.
English, like most people here here, is perfect.
We're not very popular, we don't like dancing.
Norway's wealth of oil is very careful, but it's all a small percentage of money from the last 100 to the next generation is a special function for the future generation.
In the years that everyone else had no money, he placed his hand in the streets of Norway, where everyone else had no money.
"We're happy as long as we can make the storm and the summer march," Anna says. "We're happy as long as we can."
"And he's saying "he's seven, and he's having a good coffee. "
I'm standing in the snow, and I'm waiting for something to eat, enough to eat.
Now a handburger is definitely something different, and there's something more delicious.
But there's more smelly fish tonight.
One of the number of the hotels I'm staying with is the best guests here, and maybe it's the most challenging fish I've ever had.
There's a live TV on a live TV on a picnic server.
It's like the Eurovic song.
"How many points are there for the best fish in the mountains, Thor-Jure?"
"Our aims are here, Airmer."
It's boozes, coffees.
A man's falling out of his chair, maybe he's in an aquivocal.
Or maybe all of these fish smells.
The Mexican Enerne Petina Nieto is face severe.
The new president of Mexico's new president, Enerque Peta Nietoto, is looking at the hardships and difficulties of the UN's people's expectations.
It's very bad for Mexico's traffic right now.
In the best time of the day, a busy city, was caused by some kind of main role role in the beginning of Sunday.
But the purpose was not to stop people from going to work, because the prototypes prevented him from reaching.
The new president of Mexico's new president, Enerque Peta Nieto, will take the president's president on Saturday.
He's against a hard mission.
He had a good performance in the Czech Republic, but the country has a better performance than the economic economy, but the country's estimated 60,000 lives in six years.
Mr. Pete Nieto said to the United States President Barack Obama this week, "It's a great word in Mexico to reduce the violence of my religion."
I'm going to offer a new security strategy to make us reach.
Before we give the U.S. President to the OP president, Mr. Petina Nieto's previous political experience was in the state of Mexico.
In this state of state, the capital of the capital, the capital of the state, which is, in the old state of the country, is divided into views about the new leaders.
He's an honest man.
For example, the broken Valle is remembered with love at the bavo town.
The people here are being identified by the type of corn and the gold that produced on the earth.
To reach town, you can go from Mr. Pete Nietoto's new bus, and I'm a big trip over all the roads.
The rockets that carry his name also include the environment center of modern sports center and social change.
"We're looking for him, we're looking at him." Mr. Petina Nieto's friend and the political member of the political PRIIII's party.
Especially by security and economic hunger, we hope that our country needs a real change.
After the eighth year of eight years, the PRIII was taken by Whitex in 2000.
Congressman Oliver admits that after 12 years after the president's meeting, he was expected to be waiting for the party to know about Petina Petina Nitoe.
And the opposition of the new president refuses to add itself as a piece of bread.
He's an open man, he's calling himself a great country with a great organization.
He's a man of great government and he's a man who knows to listen to all of them.
But that's not what many people have in the other side of the state have.
Cududd Nizar was known as Nealcocot in Neal de Valllovo.
He's a victim of Mexico City under the highway floor.
And the problems in town are hard and city.
This year the army was called to help with drug dealers and violence against women.
In just two years, it's been destroyed by an empty space field that we've spent in an empty space in the sky field of space.
As soon as Mr. Pena Nieto was born, more than 1,000 women were killed in Mexico, it was more than ever known for the murder of innocent women.
Mr. Petina Nieto says she can't handle the murder of the woman's murder even though she's in the best position.
In the worst way, they blame him to ignore his authority.
He's working to fight with the tears of tears in his tears while he's in the village of Irena Bethnagna, who showed me the picture of Mariaa and Mariaa's eyes.
According to the official official agreement, Maria committed suicide in 2010.
But his parents believe he was killed by the partner.
"When I went to the house, it was like, "Oh, it was like the body, Senanea.
There were signs of fighting, and death's already started.
When his mother tells the story again, Maria takes a picture down the wall, and one word with a single word:
But that's exactly what the family said.
The state officials treated me like an oldest man who caused a problem.
What they're asking is that people accept what they say and close their gangs.
"But it can't be true when it's so hard and low."
President Petina Nietoto comes with heavy responsibilities on Saturday.
For the six years we were married, the violence in Mexico was affected by violence and promised to give them priority during their new president's mission.
PRICE member Oliver says "I am the president of the Valllervo."
But this is one of the most fears of the victims in Cuudd Niza.
Bradley didn't complain about being bad, they claim that he didn't complain about being bad.
The prosecutors are trying to resist the use of Bradley Manlin's claims.
Don't stop, Maninco's army is focused at the time he's staying in jail in Virginia.
The defense wants the case to close the case with the need for the congratulations of Manin's prison.
He's accused of stealing thousands of prisoners in the army.
The prosecutors tried to convince him that the most private material in the United States had been committed by the army of Brad Manlin, who had been arrested on Friday, was trying to make a lot of complaint about the bad conduct that Brad Manin was living in prison.
F. F. M. M. Majj, before the trial in Medaland in Medaland, spoke of an event that had not occurred during the nine months of the event, when the trial took place in Queen Fen Manen Manuen Man, Queen, Quanica, in nine months.
After a day at the Celises's trial at the crime scene, he thought he was being suicide in Manin's eye, in order to end his prison.
The army arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of secrets of documents.
The article was then published by Waknets.
WkiLess never found that Manlin was a source of information.
On Friday, Feein, Fein, who's been in prison for the trial of the American military prison in April 2010, followed by the military court of Manico in the prison.
Officers made questions to Mannning and their answers.
So when Fein asked about the forms of the Friday, he said that his actions were "formed" by the guards of Manun, and that all of his activities are "the supermarkets".
The elements don't complain about being bad, but the officers claim that if the officers ask you about how to behave toward Manun, Finin.
He asked about the concerns of the man and told the visitors about his concern and told them about the concerns they were talking about, but they didn't know what they were talking about.
Manin said, "No, it doesn't mean what they said, and it doesn't mean it doesn't mean it't. "
The judge asked Mr. Denise Lindin about why he wanted them to commit suicides during the past months in January 2011.
Mani answered the purpose of the meeting and said that it was the result of the situation.
The army said that they put him in a position to protect himself and others, in order to protect him.
"I wanted to know I'm good, and I wanted to get out of the POPA situation, and to gain a better quality of my life."
On Thursday, in Iraq and in Iraq, Marsie Basana reported about two months before a military prison in Virginia.
He said he was thinking about suicide and he loved it once there.
He said he was stressed not to be allowed to know what happened to him and what happened in the world.
He said, "It's the cage, it's broken down to Capmp Gefjin."
I thought I'd die in that cage.
When Manin went to Quantico, he said most of his days were at least 21 hours, and he spends only 23 hours alone in a cell alone.
Man's only said that he's a bed, a blanket, a blanket, some clothes, some clothes and glasses.
He's trying to move because he said he'd sleep in the day and even to the rules of space.
Manin always said he slept with light from his cell.
When the guards came back at night, the guards said they woke him up and turned him back.
Manin's lawyer was given official official recognition in January 2011.
In April 2011, Fort Levenworth moved to the military prison in Kansas.
At the same time, the judge said that a statement on Friday's Thursday is a statement to the judge that he had fallen in his cell, a night in Quantintico, and asked about the number of others in the morning who had fallen asleep in his cell, asking him to go out in front of the others.
He said he didn't have a chance to cover himself with the blanket.
On Friday, the judge said that he had to take an order that Manlin should throw him off a blanket, but no one told him that he would have to throw him away.
Manin Thursday said that he had been forced to go to sleep with him because of his lack of danger.
Manin said that he could harm himself by using the underlying underwear or by using his fingers.
Manin said that that night he was taken from the body of his fingers, his fingers, and his eyes.
The judge at least hopes that his lawyer will be able to account his experience in prison and that the next year, the military court will be able to reduce the penalty for the execution.
He said he was planning to blame Manlin for more serious crimes, and he'd be able to fight in most cases.
The trial has been planned to continue this week, waiting for the officers to discuss the case.
The Pentagon Manten said that all the formalities in Quantintico are required to be treated according to rules.
To help the enemy, to help the enemy, to help the enemy, to make an error in the Internet, to be released on the Internet, and to inform the public information of public information or public reports.
If the government wears a government, he can face the prison.
Mexican American identity crisis
A lot of people say it's because of the short chance of the opportunity to leave Mexico.
The Mexicans say that the Mexicans are breaking up, they remind the Mexicans of hard times.
The Mexican Americans say they're stuck between two world countries.
I've been trying to move to Mexico for a close trip to Mexico City, and I'm surprised.
The signs were showing two examples: one of them is for "Mexican" for the other people.
I stood there a few seconds, I wasn't sure where I was going.
I've been called as "Micsetic" because I grew up in California's center.
My friends in Boston call them "granded" or "grunts" in New York" in New York.
Then I decided in Mexico to decide.
But it was Mexico.
And my grandpa didn't need a movie or a hotel in my apartment.
I was simple American.
I'm speaking Spanish, I'm good enough to run both sides of this language meeting.
But I don't have the local words, and I can't get rid of my American mind.
That's why I took my US passport, and I went up for Exactorros.
I thought about that moment when Enrique met the president of Mexico to visit the White House to meet the White House.
When the leaders of two countries meet in my day, as always, it's like, moving, drug, drugs, and trade.
Pete Nitoo is now eager to talk about why the Mexicans are supposed to stay in Mexico until it's too late to get into the United States.
The United States and Canada want to be equal to the United States and the North American Union in the United States.
Pete Nieto promised that Mexico will continue fighting with drug cards.
For Mexico, the United States's relationship with the United States is filled with negative feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought that the United States had invaded the land of Mexico in 1884, and their leaders had been forced to fight against their country.
But it's not a minute, it's a reminder for the Mexicans who think about it.
So when a U.S. authorities say a little positive thing about Mexico, you're going to start talking about the state of the Americans and the granaries of the United States.
And Montitema's kids go to war.
And yet, for Mexico, it's really about 35 million Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about negative feelings?
There's so much.
People who win in Mexico and lost lost are people who are not able to create the country.
A lot of people from Mexico have to live in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, the only reason why they live in such cities is that one person or a man in the world who has to stay in Mexico or a large village in Mexico.
And most of all, this guy is sleeping in a profile -- a little, less education, a poor village.
We shall preserve them and their sons,
Not Mexico.
And now, if we don't live in America, we're going to go to school, but we're never gonna miss the fact that what we've been through is good school and what we're doing is good, and we're never gonna miss the truth about the American Day of America.
Sometimes our identity may be worthless, but our commitment is open.
It's the United States.
And we also realize that most of the leaders in the management class don't like us.
That's emotional.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating new generation, and they look up at us as if we're not enough Mexican.
Our Spanish is never gonna be good enough, and our bond with Mexico is not as strong as ever.
Our presence is about a complete failure in their own eyes.
Our parents wouldn't go without success in Mexico.
And now we're not found in the back of the hypothetical curtain, but they still live in the United States.
When my wife was born in Guajara, the United States, was born as a legal boy to the United States, and the Mexicans were stuck to me because of who the Americans were, and the Americans and the Americans.
Although he is a U.S. citizen, he sees himself as part of the two countries.
They don't feel like the part of the Mexican Americans I know.
Also, we like to listen to Loss Tire des deste, and to listen to Bruce Springen.
You're taking the best of two worlds, but not at all.
We're being American in Mexico.
We are adopted as Mexican in the United States.
Now, as I've learned about how to break up the relationship, some Mexican leaders and some clear leaders want to connect with Diasa.
The Americans in the United States want to work as temporary volunteers to show their interest in the United States.
We're hard to tell the Americans how beautiful to visit Americans, and they're trying to encourage political leaders to strengthen their bond with Mexico.
Yeah.
This won't happen.
There's a lot of negative feelings.
And we're not sure it's a great country.
I'm afraid you're alone, fellas.
That's fair.
At least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the behavior of the United States, but if they are not ready to forgive the state of Mexico about a hundred years ago, some Americans still have to accept that they have to be committed to their family.
Hmm.
Maybe we're better than I thought.
Old wars, New East East East
The fire between Israel and Jerusalem may have been an important basis for peace.
Could there be a constant peace between Arabs and Jews in Middle East?
That's how I got another blood spill.
It's about who's started with the results, the building became more than 14th, and most of Israel was killed, and once, Israel was killed for the first time, and the great city of Israel was still nearby.
However, the Israelites and the Philistines had been stuck in their old struggle, but the Middle East changes.
The search was lifted up in the air, and the Philistines and the people of Israel were caught up in the area.
Maybe that makes them more blood than they used to.
However, there are reasons why they can't destroy their killings.
A battle that's not won.
It's hard to get a good look at the first look at it now.
Although the fire that was adopted on November 21th, the war in both sides of this week would strengthen their horses.
The Islamist who ruled Gazeaze since 2007 will claim to force the Israelites to turn away from him.
Even though some of their leaders killed some of them and the majority of the more 1,7 million people in the world have failed to destroy Israel.
Of course, the other part of Hasslist is now being used by the other extremes in the West City of the Western Republic.
More than that, he can end the time when the leaders of the world are around.
As the Islams won in the Arab world, they became strong and rich friends.
The reenactment of Turkey, who was once the most recently established Muslim nation of Israel, has taken the purpose of Turkey, and one of the highest and most powerful parts of the Soviet Union.
The people of Sembas said that the city of Lyban, who was led by a Muslim military military force, was the king of Lyban, who was led by the Lord's army.
On the other hand, the most clear between Israel's land and the rest of the country of Egypt, the President Mümham Muhamd has changed the growth of the nation of Muslims under the subsidiary of the Middle East.
In 2011, the hard time of the 30-year-old Hsüska has spent a little time for the Lord of the House of Lords.
On the other hand, it's more important to the cousins and leaders of Brother Hamas's cousins.
The future pilot can be found as an actor in the future, not even by the Israel and the Americas.
At that time, Israel's guards will be removed completely.
From the military, he was put back in the Stars box.
Israel's Demir Kubal had proved his value, and most of the Hamass were destroyed.
The Israelites will be more comfortable for a while.
As far as the United States was gone, most European countries have been accused of starting violent violent violence.
And all of them, Israel, especially when it comes to the peace process, was raised in the affairs of Bethnayayayaya.
Although the rockets from Gazezek killed about 30 Israel since 2004, Israel’s main part of the city of the Persian Empire, which was still part of the Western Empire and the nation of the country, the city of the Great Sea, was spared to the land of the Jews.
As Avid party goes on to the 30th of January, Avior Liberman's next war group is more comfortable with Mr. Netanhu.
Why are these false Philistines being fired by their own government?
If they actually run West City, they won't shoot rockets like they did in Gazze?
It's better to hold them behind the wall and hold their heads off.
Maybe it'll win, but it can still change the Arab accounts.
The Islamists won power in Egypt, and the other nations love Israel, but their priority is to deal with the challenges in their home.
Israel's defense budget is greater than the division of Arab neighbors.
A new war with local forces will not help the U.S. government officials to improve their economic economy.
The Prague, Mr. Murphy, worked with Barack Obama to make a good fire, and maybe they could start a start.
The Israelites should take a long time.
The rest of the Arab world is divided into more strife and loss of freedom, so that this week, it's an explosion within the country of Teviv, which has been formed in the country of Israel.
The pressure in the Jewish state is already on the ground, and the Arab population is being exposed, and it's also enjoyed.
In a few years, he'll be able to reach a diapers who'd grow up against Gemas for the Gazeze.
He needs treatment from both sides.
The answer is that most of the world and the common people of this newspaper have been declared by the government of Israel: the two government representing the safety of Israel.
You're a small fire in a short time, and it's going to give the strangers a little bit more pressure.
Now, it's better to stop the gun to stop the gun to the East and Kazze, and Kamas, along with the Kamas and Kamass, to accept the state of the city in 1976 and to accept the land of the province.
Foreigns also have to join Hamas and Fahih.
It's much more useful than getting a Philosophy to create a state government offer.
Mr. Obama plays part in bringing Israel to the table.
In the first century, he neglected to present his own peace plan.
She seems desperate to get inside in the White House.
It doesn't seem so painful.
America has a life-defense in Middle East.
That means that there's an agreement between Israel and the Philistines.
Cigarette's laws enter Australia in Australia
Cigarettes and disease chemicals are set up for the greens of all the bottles.
In the world of Australia, the first law on smoking and tobacco and tobacco, is usually baffleed with vaccines and colors and colors, and he's smoking and cigarettes, and he's smoking.
The only difference between health alerts and images is that the only difference between them is that it's going to be extremely severe on Saturday's day.
It's the most rare time in this world to set up the rifle.
The federal government of Australia says that young people are forced to quit smoking from drug abuse.
If people don't start smoking until they're 26 years old, they're standing on research that they're never starting to start.
"You can see that even since you're too young, children are trying to sell the company's insurance company, and you can see that they're not working with the children's ability to make a match for the child's ability to work on the market."
In Australia, one of the worst cigarettes of the world, and the changes in the world have to be very low, but others think that their names are too similar to the rest of the nations.
They made a hard bicycle against the laws of the sea.
The company said that they would support their black trade trade and that they would be able to support their trade and that they would be more likely to reach higher and more efficient cigarettes.
He said, "It's a serious result that you don't want to take a job."
The hearts of China and Indonesia will be brought to sell more of these products in Australia.
Others say the law has increased its work.
A small family company, Zico Purd, made up of two months ago to remove the cigarettes from the Sandy River, the British Inquisition, the British Inquisition, the British Inquisition, the British Inquisition, and the American Inquisition of America.
Zico's selling more than 60,000 copies of sales from the ball. And he says he's waiting for a new shock.
It's a good job for us.
Experts say that it's social media's political politics's political policy.
After a series of television programs and sports programs were prohibited, many sales of drug abuses and drug abuses were forced to keep them away from places where they wanted to be seen.
Australia forbade local companies and civilians to broadcast online material but can't be deficated.
Becky Freeman, a member of the University of Sydney, said, "If you stay in the market, you'll only have to join this little window if you want to know your product.
Freemans said that Youuubeve, Twitter, and Facebook media have increased in research.
What we need to ask, is this a political citizen who really loves the smoke cigarettes, or is this a market company in this place?
British Ambacco said that he was focused on trying to deal with the new rules of Australia in order to follow the new rules.
These countries have been falsely accused of spending money to pay for the new laws of Russia and the U.S. government, even in the country of the United States.
It's probably in the middle of 2013.
In principle, the government said that the government had met with other countries, thinking that the government would make similar packages.
It was the first country in the year 2001 to warn the photos of the photos.
Now these have spread over more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey, and Ukraine.
In England, New Zealand, there are more laws in South Africa and India.
Most of the Australians in Australia challenge cigarettes.
The pictures don't affect me.
I'm going to ignore them.
While he was buying a package with a camera camera, Victor El Hae said, "Take a cigarette and put it in one cigarette."
To be honest, there's only one reason to leave, and she's my little girl.
James said that the king of Sydney was driving the King's shop at the center of the package.
Yu said, "I've had an hour off my delivery, and now it takes me four hours."
"The government should not be prohibited, then we're all done, we're going to close the shop, and we're going to shut it down."
It's always a very bad thing to keep the Fee Beij in the World.
I spent five hours waiting for this flight on Thanksgiving, and when our plane was under severe challenges, we had to wait for another flight.
So I've spent a lot of time thinking about it.
I won't lie to you.
I don't know if it's really interesting to wait for half a day in the airport.
But in a way that increases, some academics and children are still trying to relax my progress.
They sometimes say that we and our children are normal.
It's hard to go to the interesting dances, and maybe it increases creation.
And because most of us are connected to one screen, we don't have the benefit of the effects.
So we need to throw it down?
Yeah.
And no.
But I'm going back to this.
First of all, I've been wondering if it's a new kind of waste of time, as much as many people are concerned.
In Canada, Greek and Roman history professors at the University of Cleveland and Rome and said, "It's not like that.
He said, "There's actually a long history for the rest."
There's a wall in the first century from Lattoni's walls.
And then we're talking about how we know what we're going to do with it.
The problem is that it's been identified in a number of different ways, and he said that he was a psychiatrist at the University of York University in Canada.
After looking into the research policy and putting the idea into a 100-cent-million group, Professor Estawood and his colleagues, I have found that I'm not interested in "sing a lot of people."
The thing that separates us from the risk of being too busy, but she said she's not interested, she wants to be.
He said there's no reason to do anything.
He said, "The social experience of the noise is the effects of the ecological and slowness of time."
It can look very similar to a pneumonia.
But Professor Esstwood may be about it, but people who are bored have a problem in the environment or in the world, but they see themselves as their own problems.
Sometimes we think we're bored when it's difficult to concentrate.
Professor Esstwood and his colleagues published in the book "The Human Rights of Public Sciences" in the United States.
Some groups have heard a high-level TV program in the next room, and others have heard it very little at the low level, but the third group never heard.
Those who heard the high-level television reports were reported more critical than two other groups, but they didn't know why it was a challenge, and they're not sure why it's difficult to deal with it.
One of the writers and one of the writers of the University of Guelph University in northern Ontario said that he was trying to break up, that he's trying to reduce the risk of becoming a busy, busy mission.
On the other hand, when you read something boring, you may be able to help your music, like, to look at bad cars in your factory.
In fact, it may make people suffer more physical and less physical than physical.
He said, "The children who have been allowed to be active are learning more than kids who are forced to keep moving," Professor Fenke said.
We're all trying to get through some of these things, the plane's late, a boring conversation, a boring movie.
But some people are more critical than others.
In the 1980s, the researchers developed a "corruptism" to help death.
Most things I have to do, "I have a reciprocal and a lot of interesting interest, and I don't have time to do anything."
Stehen Vonovic, a psychologist at West Florida University, said that researchers, who are interested in women, are more likely to be more concerned with the need for women, especially for women.
But in general, the adults in adulthood are quite a small group.
In 1991, a professor of human and social development in the Illinos University, Reed Larson created an eight - day communication device with humans and parents.
They found themselves bored when they were at school and paid for the school but not at 23 percent when they were at school.
On the other hand, they said they're bored with 3% of parents.
Professor Larson said now he didn't know that his face would be higher than the lower face.
But he said that when children and adults don't have much control over what they want to do, he knew that I had to “put it back. ”
So I'm going back to my first question: is it good for the human being?
Sometimes, no, because when the research is too slow, it shows people that they can get people to use the gambling, gamblers, gamblers, gadgets, or gadgets.

You can answer all questions about the main lines of wealth.
You can send your answer to your specific question and send your own official address to the secretary's address.
I'll be in a deep mood to answer you soon.
What's the retired policy?
MILLIONS can't work at least 60 percent of their work in less than 60 percent of their work.
They may also have lost their power in extreme cases as well as in cases of financial loss of success in the workplace.
Who's worth it?
I'm writing from the bank, my name's Melm Gühren, and I've got my cigarettes in 920 days, and I've also got 1460 cigarettes and 1460 days a day.
Besides, I'm a bug patient.
I'm connected to the dysfunction.
I'm still working at a job business.
Can I have the amount of money?
- I'm here for the first time.
You didn't know when you first entered a business when you mentioned the problem.
But let's briefly tell you how to deal with the cost.
For one thing, the most important of the consequences in the law has been smoking since 10 years, and you have to gather for 1,000 days.
Besides, you're also estimated that you've lost at least 60 percent of your energy in the SGK patient or a business security operation.
But because you're sick here, you can't have 60 percent of the time you're not able to fill up your 60 percent.
Of course we don't know how many years you've been working.
The day you completed your 10 years together, and the day you completed it, the SGK will be in your case.
Compulsion for the right of wealth
Is there no one to be taxed in 10 years, no one's got to pay?
- Six days of pay must be completed.
But there's only one exception, and there's only one exception, who's decided to have a constant amount of time-to-do-san-a-quarters, who's been allowed to have a limited amount of interest in the other than 10 years.
Those who have been sick or ill or ill will will will be told that our record will always be in the presence of those in our writings.
It's the condition of those who're not starting to work.
I'm Ahmet Girls.
They said, "When I carry all the circumstances in the SGK law, you can't take me for a month until I'm sick before I get my first job."
I'm very innocent.
It's not fair.
How am I supposed to apply?
- Ahmet, you wrote that you've made all the circumstances in the Law, but one of the mothers and one of the mother-in-laws and the law-laws in the law law should not be allowed to work until he's done to work for the loss of blood insurance.
It can't be carried because you can't carry this wine.
On the other hand, when I take the age insurance, you may be able to apply the advice.
- I have 3980 days, and I've been smoking for 16 years.
It's been identified by SGK before I got involved.
They said you can't be retired.
In this case, what am I gonna do?
I won't be retired.
Would you show me the way?
- Yes, you heard the truth.
You can't be retired.
But in the SGK law, there's a law for you.
So, before 2008, there's two conditions.
For the first time, if you've been working on this history, you're aware that you're not valued by your SGK before your work, at least 15 years of age, and you can buy an age of 36 per cent.
So we suggest that you're not going to be able to connect with the nearest SGK Director.
- Well, if you were to get a job after the 2008th year, you could have been able to buy at least 45 years of insurance and at least 39 years of age, and the age of death.
Do you have to leave the job when you apply?
I still work as a driver in a business business.
When I went to the hospital, he put me on cancer.
I want to be retired.
Do I have to leave the business in this case?
Can't I handle the cost without leaving?
I don't want to stay without work until I'm connected to the moon.
- That's right.
You're supposed to be out of work for a month-blowing wish.
But before you apply it, you have to be recognized by your SGK law.
But if you're in property, you'll have to stick with each other.
There's no point in giving a month-to-blowing request, you have no risk of working.
It's enough you have 1,000 days to do that.
When you go back to SGK, you're gonna love one of the patients who'd be trained.
And when you bring your health report to SGK (KKK), this report will be considered in your own health health system, and it will be possible for you to decide whether your health is affected by the loss of your health.
However, for a 10 - year - long period period of insurance, you may have to be able to get involved.
So we can say this a little bit, and it's not the result of seeing the SGK health board's decision of "sult."
But if any cigarettes are able to handle all the conditions, SGK could ask for the exact amount of balance and access to the moon.
If this happens, and the other conditions can be useful for a little longer early months.
Wouldn't it be reasonable for you to pay for your tax debt?
I'm a male insurance insurance.
I'm carrying all the terms.
But they said, "You can't be retired because I owe you a debt."
I have to do it.
- I'll read it carefully.
Who told you who told you.
You haven't written the other conditions, but if you think that you're carrying these conditions, you're paying for 4/bs debt.
But I can give you a special instrument.
I suggest you pay your debt to pay for banks or similar equipment.
No matter how early the month is, you take it in less than a month, and you'll pay it for a minute.
These institutions are designed for you, so that you may refrain from writing down the records of what you used to do.
What stadiums do you look like?
I worked as a co-CK-K-Cur and a medical officer.
Where's he gonna connect to me when I'm worthy of the moon?
If you've been working as a high school student, Bag-Klu-Klulu, and one of the most famous sportss, you're in the last place, and you're in the last month, and you're going to have the same health and you're going to be able to move out of the site for the next month.
SGK is also the patient's address reports.
How are you going to apply the tax application?
What hospital report can I get from a health report?
- You've got enough access to social security services or social security centres for health reports.
The SGK will love the citizens of the United States, the University of California, and the U.S. hospital, and the government will love military soldiers.
However, in the year that these patients are not found, it can also be done with the full health care of health patients.
Can't love a private hospital?
- There's only conditions.
In the old order to be the state hospital only, when the state needs to be in the care of the state hospital and the life care of the patient and the lives of the patient, the new patient has to be able to make a contract with a new patient.
What are the conditions that are looking for love?
It's enough for a thousand days to ensure that the cost of insurance condition in the SEKKA is necessary to ensure that the health condition of the insurance system is about 1,000 days.
The hospital's going to be paid by SGK.
Besides, it's not going to be called for 10 years, so SGK's looking at this.
In the case of the financial condition of the financial health issue, if it's in too much trouble, it's based on a 10 - year period of insurance activity, not only for 18,000 days, but also for health health care.
So when the person first comes to identify the cost of his financial cost, he's going to be able to see if he's able to look at it in a very large amount of cash day.

Young people are being lured into trap
It was found in the case of the 20th camp that the terrorist campaigns have been performed, of course, of course, of honor, of honor, of honor, of honor, of honor, of honor, of honor, of honor, and of honor, and of honor, and of the name of the king, and of the king, and of the tribe of Manasseh.
According to the public report, most young people are joining in college with a lot of colleges.
On the other hand, outside the camp, their young ones are winning a trap by traping their young ones in the camp.
In these camps, the organization also increases the growth of young ones by training new ones.
In these camps under the summer campaign, the organization is trained as to how to turn it into violence.
Message came after half.
Denis Komza found the owner of the New Jersey House 50 years ago by a kid named Denis Cossses Kotszaus.
The glass bottle, which we've been through in the United States, came out of the middle of a house after Sandy Kassa.
"If it is true, please answer the following questions and send them the address in the address book.
This is a scientific study by Dennis Kossa 1.
In the written book, he wants to tell the person who's found it, where it is, where it is, how it is, and how it is.
In the bottle, it's also a waste of money to pay for an e-mail and mail fee.
In the New Jersey coast of New Jersey, he was given a total of 165 miles [35 km] of the ocean, which we were able to receive in the summer of 1963.
"I thought it was about 12-year-old, "I thought it'd be a shock to see the ocean, but I didn't think it was going to come back."
The sound is in love
I'm surprised that Turkey's first voicewriter told me what to do with the voice of Superensors, and I'm surprised.
The sound of sound technology or sound technology is probably coming to the sound system of everyone's thinking about music.
And did you know that the voice can prevent terrorism, the sound of my voice, that you might be able to kill yourself, that you can get somebody you want to get to know, or that you can make a secret to the world?
After I graduated from the University of Science University, the U.S.A. announced the U.S.A. in the United States, and the U.S. U.S. U.S. spoke on the U.S.S. at the University of Middle Eastern University.
The media in the Beijing School of Science at the School of Science in the School of Sciences, the music, the music, the technology, and the technology of technology, and the technology of technology and technology.
A message of terrorism.
"What is it?" I'm the first question.
"It's an technology used in the world.
It's all our brains with electricity.
The sound is also a kind of electric electric.
Using this energy, you can change people's mind, which you want to do, and I'm taking the answer."
And one of the most important properties of sound technology is the public message.
There's a message outside of music or song that is placed outside the heart of a person, but he's not able to recognize the appointment.
For example, when a terrorist attack occurs, it's said that it's possible to make a piece of music in that region.
As a member of the song was changed to the song, a message of "Don't do this" appears to be an anti-semitional message.
He doesn't know what he's hearing, but his sentence is like a voice called a "dom."
He looks forward to seeing him.
But in both parts of the world and Turkey, there is absolutely no law and punishment.
The Susmir is a message that he has prepared to tell students about a conference in England only once in the United States.
"When I've been listening to a music student.
I put a voice in the music room called 'Su'.
At the end of the session, I asked the students that they couldn't stop talking.
They said they were all thirsty, and they said they were too thirsty."
Pamir says, as far as he says, there are public messages in our town, "There are some radio channels that have been identified.
There's a channel in Germany called "Kak's Sound Radio, which is a mousecracy.
Sblumblumal has been attacked by religious, religious, religious, and drug abuse.
The German police also know that, but it's not because they've changed their frequency."
And it's also used such dangerous messages in the music world.
Especially in the song of some city metal metal bands...
These claims that there were no terrorists in the mountains, no terrorists, no terrorists, called the subsidiary.
The table of contents
The sound technology can be used in cases of crime.
It's especially in the U.S.'s interest in bank robbery.
For example, when the police phoned the phone with the phone phone, they can determine what is in the bank inside of the bank.
It's different when a voice hits the floor, the throne, the wall, or any other matter.
It is also possible to identify the size of the room's size of the room, to determine how many times the room is.
Thus, the voice of a sinner can determine what kind of items he has in a room.
And there's a computer program that was used for this, although Pamir even made his drawings from Tatara to Tatara, and said, "I've thought it'd be able to make the perfect sound of the work of the 575 lofts in the building.
It's not a expensive technology, it's worth 4-5 grand."
It's also used in sound frequency and production.
Pamir's got a lot of work to do on this.
For example, his businessmen went to a restaurant in a high-level restaurant meeting, and the sound of the talks was made out of the table.
Only those on the table can hear the talks.
There's no one else on the table.
The general system of these types says: "If you want to destroy a voice, you'll fill it with the same piece of carbon, and you'll be able to produce the energy of the current energy.
No one's going to get to the plane without this system.
Because the sound of the plane engines is too high to be heard.
They destroy themselves with these sounds in the plane with each other.
Even if it is open with this system, you can create a peaceful environment in your home."
Was it made by the cornpilots?
There are other interesting things that Pamir, from the first voice of Turkey, did.
For example, he made a pattern that could not be heard from the music station in northern Asia.
The sound can't go beyond the border, it's being likened to another voice.
Even in a room that can be quiet after a certain line.
Pamir also brought the sports hall for a sports officer and a concert.
It's a double-distance.
'Cause when you play basketball, you need the fire, but you don't have to be hot in concerts.
In open concerts, it's possible to make a sound sound that can be heard only by sound technology.
"We're using frequency to destroy the noise, destroying noises, fixing people's mind and making them better.
MTV's too far ahead of this.
The open concert concerts are holding up and it's being heard like a studio in the field."
That's what Trentak's experience has happened.
And separate two numbers with the voice frequency.
There were scientists who claim to be sounding in the Egyptian pilots.
They thought the stones could be placed in the voice.
I'm asking, "Are you not comfortable with bad goals?"
"When I read the work of the New York University of York University on the Internet, I was afraid if others would read it.
Because what they say is that even well - meaning people say that they can cause bad consequences without the labs."
"The streets are powerful with Arabic."
The noise, Mr. Pamir, who said that the problem would affect the human condition, explains, “The sound that all the sounds of the ear are being heard.
But the sound that people are alone, and the other sounds are being directed to the brain, and the other sounds are actually being directed to the brain, and it's actually getting tired and tired.
That's why you need to clear your brain, walking naked in the land, moving to nature.
I think it's supposed to be set up for the bleaching in schools.
That's why the student's only teacher can concentrate on the voice of teaching, and for a long time, he may be able to maintain concentration."
And said that if your voice is read from the Bible because of the voice of the voice of voice, he says that it will be effective, he will be very careful that the words that make him feel that he's being very rich, he's going to be impressed with the voice of the voice.
"But I have to read their prayers aloud, when I read the song, I'm going to cry.
A loving recipe with Frerich Raabe
"Is it possible to fall in love with a man's frequency?" I don't think.
Don't fall in love with Pamir's feelings, and the teacher said, "You need to find out what you want to do when you want to love someone you want to.
You can be affected by using this frequency with a higher frequency.
Consider, for example, the amount of pressure on the person’s part.
And you want to play a music playing with him.
If you're going to steal the energy of the company, you're going to lose the strength of those who're down on the 300 percent of the company, it's more likely to increase the impact of the person's impact.
Maybe that's how he's in love with the person who's at that moment."
Since political systems in the world are much more effective in the world, Pamir, when the voice sounds are planned, they can feel a strong political force, like a very powerful reality.
"Now, the sound that Michael has been raised from Japan is trying to make the sound of a man's voice, "What's the sound of the human voice?"
It's just a wonderful gift, like a human breath."
'The price's prices will rise.'
Canadian Jens Capitali Dane, who is a member of the United States, said, "It will continue to help the government to reduce the cost of money, so that the government will continue to support it," he said.
In fact, in the first half of the year of the world's most investors in the world, the price rate of the world's population has been resilient in the prices, and the price of the prices, and the price of the price of the prices in China, and the price of the prices, and the price of the sixth prices, which they're talking about, "I'm saying, "I'm going to make it a big part of China."
When I recall that India was the largest gold mineer in India, he said, "I don't believe that I'm not going to see the results of the government's sales sales, so I can't see that it's not going to be very far off.
People have used their expressions to find a way in this circle."
Hushewsky recommended that investors will continue to serve as a security tool.
The many Western government will forget that the commitments of commitments are based on "blaspheres".
Governments are trying to reduce their debt in order to reduce the cost of money.
So the gold prices are to be raised up from the present level."
"In the day, gold, marketing in market risking the risk of preventing the risks."
The World Council of the World Council of Marcus Gibbb, said, "If there are more complex and more complex and more complex, there is a state of risk in the world's state, there's a high-sprand-destruction rate, which is the key to preventing and positive.
He said, "It is much better to help me cope with the situation," he said from small amounts of gold.
Gibb, who showed up in the last 10 years of the sixth investors, said, "Alex is less than 1 percent of the population's population.
It means that the market is still important to grow up in gold investors.
According to this section, 78 percent of the year, 78 percent of the gold and picnics have been recognized as the protection of a powerful, political organization that is under the protection of the investment. "
"In India, to increase economic growth."
The world's most popular gold marketing questions about India and China, or China, and China, in the second year of the gold value of the gold and gold prices, and in the second year of the year, the amount of gold, and the amount of money that they spend was added to the moon.
The group reminded me that in China, 54 percent in India, in India, 51 percent in India.
"The Gibbra was in the middle of a train where they sold them with a little gold price, and said, "It'd be in the middle of the morning."
After the gold prices of the gold fall, the demand grew up in demand, and the iron pressure stopped. "
In India, at the age of six, the government's gold sales of the state's gold attacks, and the state of India, in the case of the state Bank, also shows that it's very difficult to do so, so it can be said that it's very difficult to be able to walk around the stage and to move the country.
The World Council of India believes that India needs to see six investors as an investment.
They also have added that they have to increase economic levels in economic institutions to support economic growth.
Global GoldSdlers
According to the World(s), the World Gold(s) stated last week, this year has also been the World(6,63,6,63, and 6th) of the year.
