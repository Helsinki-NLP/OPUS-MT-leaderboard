Is that what Norway is the most smell of the world?
Norway's five million million people enjoy the most high standards of life, not just in Europe.
Could the secret of the country's success have been connected to the local fishing business with some fish?
Take the past cheese option.
Put them in the middle of a wet football pattern.
Give it a week.
Now you've got one of the big Norvevan tastes that will fit your nose.
I'm in the little Fagers town, about three hours away from Oslo.
It's amazing, and it's smell, it's always hot in the air.
Raffles were trapped, and in the water, the smell of fish is made up of as a year.
When the darkness cool and cold, the Norwayns gather these poor people here for a festival.
"If you call it "Talk General" in the full-time conference and say, "If you're "Rark" in a room, then you're going to have a room."
People around us eat little fish and drink plenty of wine.
The Air says, "People like it more than Aquavah.
Drink can kill the smell.
I'm calling a few pieces.
If you can get away from your nose, it's not bad, it's not a long bus trip after a long drive.
It's a very different time when the fish's rivers are in the air before their fridges in the sun and in the salt water and the salts that they wait for.
Then, when the winter is still standing in the middle of the winter, it begins to dry away from the midst of the desert.
Just one generation was forced to leave their country to search for thousands of Norwegian workers, and most of them moved to the United States.
Now it's growing up with more than 13% of the population, more than 13% of high-power jobs, high-prespons, high-sympathic system.
He's been working for people who are more rich than Norve's richer than Norway soon.
Raffics represent something important, but it's part of life.
The most expensive food you can buy.
But everything is a small amount, or a small beer or a sandwich.
Norway is not often coming to global news, and most people like that.
The people here are still interested in talking about the name of the white guy who killed seven men, women, and children.
Instead, it's called "22 July."
The Italians are forced to believe that one of their own countries can make a job like this and murder.
Norway's rich wealth has grown up in the beginning of the 1970s, the world's largest oil and gas.
"It's not the only way we're doing this when we're doing long long hair long hair hair and supermarkets, but it's not the only way we're doing it."
So how do We make the people to be a distinct people?
English, most people here are perfect.
We're not such a show, we don't like it.
Norwegian oil has been very careful with its wealth -- a small amount of money from the prime minister's wealth -- all except for the future benefits of the future generation.
In the years when everyone else had the money that he had not had, Norvan's bag was tied up in the days that he had no money.
"We're happy as long as we can make a rock and walk through the mountain," Anna says.
"And we're going to eat a lot of flowers." It's a nice joke.
I'm standing up and waiting for something to eat.
Now it's definitely something different, and there's a lot more delicious taste.
But there's more smelly at that fish tonight.
One of the numbers I've been staying for dinner are the best, and maybe they're giving me the most difficult fish.
With Raffic plates, there's a TV connection on a live television.
It's like the Eurovision song race.
"How many points do you have there for the best fish in the mountains, Thor-Jier?"
"We're here, Air."
They've got coffees.
A man's on the chair, maybe he's in the influence of Aquaquid.
Or maybe smell all these fish.
The Mexican Enrique de Pea Nieto face the difficult times
As the new president of Mexico's new President, Enriquee Nieto is looking forward to the relief of the UN Grant Grant and the people's neighbors.
The traffic of Mexico is very bad now.
In the best times, the main city in the main city of the main city of the world has caused a public campaign to spread the main road from Monday to Monday.
But the purpose was to prevent people from going to work, not preventing the protesters from reaching their office.
The new President of Mexico, Enrique de Nietoto, will take the president of the United States, and will carry out the commission to lead the nation.
It's against a tough task.
Phillip Calic had a good focus in Mexico, but in six years, it's been a good performance in the country, but it's not about 60,000 deaths in the country.
Mr. Peina Nieto said this week, "I have a great promise to stop the U.S.O.O. R.O.O. international people of Mexico," Mr. Pena Nieto said.
But I'm going to give a new security strategy that will help us reach.
Before leaving the U.S.O., Mr. Peeto's first political experience in Mexico was in the Mexican state of Mexico.
The growing crowd is divided into the new leader of the former leader in this country.
A man who's a truthful man
For example, Sadl Willle remembers his love in the town of Bravo.
Those who live here are credited to the beauty of my vacation and the six-year-olds.
To get to town, you can go out of Mr. Pena Nieto's new highway, and all of the roads are large.
And the plaques who carry his name are the modern sports center of modern sports and impressive climate.
"We're looking at him to bring him back to health and permanent changes," Mr. Peena Nieto's friend and his political party.
Especially because of security and economy, we hope to change a real change.
After 81 years of unsupervised, the PRII was over by Vincent Fox in 2000.
At 12 years after the board of the Congress, the Congress admitted that there was too much waiting for the party to wait for Enquetoto.
And your opposition is rejected as the president's lack of self-defense.
An honest man named himself by a great country.
He's a great government man and a man who's listening to it all over.
But on the other side of the state, it's not the idea that many people have access to ancient leaders.
Caiudada would not have been able to cut through the streets with Valalcoil Bervy's light.
It's a bank offering under many open roads under the highway.
And the problems in the city are difficult and city.
This year, the army has been called to help with drug gangs who are working in the neighborhood, and it has been particularly violent with women.
In just two years, the woman who had been killed in a empty area of an abandoned place, just in two years, had been put to death by the woman who had been killed for two years.
When Mr. Peina Nieto was killed in Mexico, more than 1,000 women were killed in Mexico, with more violent murders than the murders of these innocent women.
When Mr. Peina Nieto was in the best position, she said she couldn't do enough to turn the murder into a murder problem.
In the worst, they blame him not to see his management.
In the village of the village of the village of Breamen, Iria Breagna, my daughter, is trying to fight the pictures of Marianana, while she's looking at me with her eyes.
According to the official version of things, Mariana killed in 2010.
But he believes his family was killed by the department.
"When I went to the beach, it was like the body was ruined."
There were tracks showing him, and death has already begun.
When his mother tells her story again, Maria's looking down a picture of a picture of a single word on her wall, she's at the Alet:
But it's exactly what this family said.
The state authorities treated me as an old speaker, who'd deal with the problem.
What they want is what people say and shut their mouth down.
"But it's not true when it's so compulsive, it's not true."
The President Peina Nieto comes with heavy responsibilitys on Saturday.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico for six years, and he promised them to give them first.
The PRIT college says "I'm a president like the Valerie Brav."
But it's the most scared of the victims in Cududa's family.
Bradley didn't complain about being bad, they're saying that they're a prosecutor.
The prosecutors are trying to resist Bradley Manin's bad response.
During the trial, Mannning is focusing on the time when the military soldier in Virginia is staying in prison.
He wants the case to close the case with the case of Defense Mannning.
Nearly thousands of secret documents are accused of stealing.
The D.C.A.'s most secret substance in the history of the U.S.A., said that the army of Bradley's worst incubator of the U.S. reported that he was accused of having a bad attitude during the time of his military activity.
During the trial in F.M., the prosecutor of the Council of Agriculture in March, said that during the last nine months of the interview, the representative of the U.S. President of the U.A. was reported during the trial.
The day after she realized that she had been a violent arrest and that she had been sentenced to death, she realized that after her death, Maninginz had been taken to the defense of Mangugne's decision to end her case.
The military officer who arrested on June 2010 has been accused of stealing thousands of secret documents while working on the mission in Iraq.
It's been published by my assistant WikikieLaks later.
Wkikikes never found out that Manin's information was based on the information.
On Friday, Fin Fin, who was imprisoned until June 2011, was transferred to the meeting of the soldier in the prison with Quinn, who was arrested in April 2011.
Mys asked Mannning's questions and they wrote their answers.
When Fin Fein Friday asked about the formula, the behavior of man's behavior was described by Mamma's behavior, and all of his behavior was "specience".
The formulas don't show bad behavior, even if the officers ask about Manin's way of conduct, he claims that if they ask him about the right way, Fin F.
He spoke about his concerns and gave the visitors his concerns about his concerns, and he said they were about the concerns of the visitors, and the visitors gave them their answer.
Mann said, "You don't have any names, and it doesn't mean that he didn't want anything."
In 2011, Judge Denise told Lind Deek about why he wanted him to consider suicide on the way he wanted him to commit suicide.
He answered that the purpose of the statement was to be given at the meeting.
To protect himself and others, the army said that they put him in a position where he had a name of suicide.
"I wanted to know I'm good, and I wanted to get out of the PI.I wanted to get out of my eye condition, and I wanted to get out of my eyes," he said.
On Thursday, he announced his arrest in Iraq, and two months before he was arrested in June 2010, the military officer in Marian Vikanico, was released in June 2010, where he was held in prison for two months before the release of the U.S.
He said he thought he was suicide and he loved it once over there.
He said he's a challenge that he's not allowed to know what's going on in the world.
He said, "My wife's been cast into Campaphon," "Muman's Day."
I thought I'd die in that cage.
When he went to Quantico, he said most of his days spent most of his days in less than 21 hours, 23 hours, and a small cell.
Mann said he was just a sleeping bed, a blanket, a blanket, a hole, some of his fingers, his eyes.
He's trying to move because he said he's in the day to sleep and even the rules are against.
Mann said he always slept on light from outside his cell.
When the guards came back the night, they said they woke him up and woke him up.
Mannning's lawyer was an official statement to Mannning's behavior in January 2011.
In April 2011, he moved to the military jail in the military in Kansas.
At the same time, the judge made a statement on the Day of Friday to the Manunning Mann, asking him whether he had been sleeping in the cell in Quantico in the morning and asked the rest of the rest of the day about the rest of the day.
He said he's not given a chance to pay him a blanket during the Manning number.
In questioning the judge on Friday, the judge said that he had to throw a blanket into a blanket that no one had to throw him out of his guard's orders.
Mannning's Thursday said that it was hard for him to show him that he wasn't a threat to himself.
Manmura said he could harm his underwear or his fingertips, but he didn't do it.
Mannning said that the night your underwear was taken from his fingers and his eyes.
The attorneys at least give their experience at least in prison and hope that the next year, the military in court, will be reduced to a severe trial in the trial of the next year.
The Defense said Mannning will admit he's guilty of a smaller crime, and he was planning to fight a lot of crime.
The trial has been planned to continue this week, and the prosecutor is expected to discuss the issues that the prosecutors are being handled.
The Penton Mannico's all over the world of Quantico's highest standards in Quantico.
Those who are involved in opposition to Manning will be able to help the enemy to help, to help him get on the Internet, to help him on the Internet, to be able to deliver his own information on the Internet, and to be able to help his public information, or to be registered.
If he wears all the facts, he can face the jail.
Mexican American identityName
He says that many people are forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of the opportunity here.
The Mexicans are in the land, they remind the Mexicans of times when they remind the Mexicans,
The Mexican Americans say they're stuck between two worlds.
I had a close trip to Mexico, and I came back to my surprise.
The mark showed two points: "Mexics" for "Mexic" for the other people, "Experics" ("Experion")
I stood there a few seconds, I wasn't sure where I was going.
I've been called all my life as "alk" in California's center.
My friends in Boston say they're "who're good" in the New York City.
Then I decided in Mexican America.
But it was Mexico.
And my grandfather didn't have to go to the dinosaur or a restaurant in my grandfather's apartment.
I was a simple American.
I'm talking Spanish, I'm good enough to manage both sides of this language.
But I don't have the local words, and I can't get rid of my American accent.
That's why I bought my EU passport, and I went to the Exgenorics.
I thought it was the moment that he visited the White House of White Sarajevo to meet the president of Mexico this week.
As long as two countries meet each day, it's like moving, drug, drug and commercial.
Peina Nieto's Mexicans were now in Mexico to talk about the possibility of moving to the United States to join the United States.
He wants to be associated with the United States and Canada, and he wants to build a trade on a European market in North America.
Although Peina Nieto doesn't suggest anything, he swore that he would continue fighting the drug dealers with the drug dealers.
The relationship with the United States with the United States is filled with complex and unhappy feelings.
Most Americans probably didn't think that the United States had been working in Mexico, and he never thought it was hard to force the land of his ancestors.
But it's not a minute, it's not a few minutes, it's all about Mexicans.
That's why when a U.S. government authorities say a little bit about Mexico, you're beginning to respond to the complaints between the Americans and the Americans in Mexico.
And Montezuma's kids go to war.
And yet, for Mexico, it's actually involved more than 35 million American Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about negative feelings?
There's plenty.
There are people who have won in Mexico, and people who have lost the country, who created the people and who created the country.
A lot of people from Mexico have been able to live in Los Angeles, Lasels, Lassen, desen, dexen, and San Antonio, and perhaps one of us may have to go to a big distance or a lot to Mexico.
And most of all, it's consistent with a profile.
And We will surely take away what they have been promised, and We will take away from them patience.
Not Mexico.
And even if we're not living in the American dream now, we're going to the good schools, and we're never gonna miss the fact that America's Rylu.
Our identity may be obvious, but our loyalty is open.
United States.
We also realize that most of the students in the manager class don't like us.
It's a feeling.
They're seeing us as an impassionant reminder of a new culture, and they're looking at us like we're not a Mexican group.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, and our bond with Mexico is never strong enough.
Our existence is all about failure in their eyes.
If our families weren't successful in Mexico, they wouldn't have failed.
And now we're not able to find ourselves in the back of the rope, but it's still the same thing that lives in the United States.
My wife was married to the United States in Guaffa, and I was often given more attention to the Mexicans who were still in Mexico and the Mexicans in Mexico.
Even though the United States is a citizen, he sees himself as part of the two countries.
At the same time, most Mexican Americans don't feel like part of both of the Americans I know.
We also like to listen to Los Tiggs de Nor Nor Nor Noreves and Bruce Springe.
You're taking both the best of the world, but you're not the root.
We're an American in Mexico.
We're being adopted as Mexican in the United States.
Now, like I've learned to make a relationship more complicated, some Mexican leaders and some of the lights want to connect with Diarasa.
To show their interest in the United States, the Mexicans want to be able to run the Mexicans as "almels."
We'll tell the Americans how beautiful a country is to visit the Americans and force political leaders to strengthen their bond with Mexico.
Yeah.
That won't happen.
There's a lot of negative feelings.
And we're not sure that this is a great country.
I'm afraid you're alone, fellas.
That's fair.
At least some Mexicans have been ready to forgive Mexico for a half and a half years before they're ready to forgive Mexico, but some Mexicans still have to respond to their behavior as much as they can.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more sensitive than I thought.
The old wars, the New Middle East
For Israel and Ham, there is a basic basis for peace between Israel and Ham.
Could there be peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
It shows me that there's another sort of hope like that.
It was about who began to start the scientific arguments, and most of them were killed in the first 14th century, and were killed in the land of Israel, and were killed in the first century, and the nation of Israel was near the Great Eastern tribes of Israel.
However, when the Israelites and the Philistines appear in their old conflicts, the Middle East tends to change.
The distribution was lifted up, and no delight, no pleasure, no delight, the Philistines and the Israelites were caught in an area of Israel.
Maybe this makes them more blood than they used to fight.
But there are reasons to think that they can kill their lives.
What a terrible fight it's won!
In the first view, it's hard to get right right now.
Even though the firemen who agreed on on November 21 was strengthened by war in both sides of the week.
Since 2007, the Squads leaders who ruled Gazze, will have forced the Israelites to abandon the Israel.
Despite their leader's death and the 1,77 million people could not destroy Israel's most violent and violent corner of the world.
Of course, the other part of Hamasististist, who is now ruled by the great burgers in Fowin, is now taking the other part of the West City.
More than that, the leaders of Hammas can get out of their time.
As the Islamists gained a reputation in the Arab world, the Islamists made powerful friends and rich friends.
Israel was once the closest nation of Israel, the most powerful nation of the nation of Israel, the most powerful, the most powerful, and the most powerful of all.
He said that he would be the leader of the nation of Israel, who ruled in the territory of Israel, would be the leader of the Muslim army of Lübb, and would be the king of the land of Judah.
On the other hand, the most prominent countries of Israel were in the south of Israel and the most important country in the south of Egypt, and the president of the United States changed the area of M.A.
He had a lot of time to run Ms. Ms. President of Egypt until 30 years in 2011.
On the contrary, Brother Hammas' cousins and leaders are much more involved in the community.
The future diploma may be considered an actor who is not even Israel and America.
At the same time, Israel's reporters will have the full results.
From the military, he was put back in the Hammas box.
Israel's nation has proved the value of the antibiotic image, and most of Hammas were destroyed by Hammas.
The Israels will sleep for a while.
According to diplomaticism, most European countries have been accused of making the last major violence of the European country.
In addition to all of them, Israel, especially the ruler of the former district of BiH, has grown up in the land of Bulgaria, where the presence of peace is greater.
Although the charts from the Gaze have been killed for nearly 30 years since 2004, Israel had killed Israel as part of the mother of the city of Jerusalem and the nation of the nation of Judah, even though the inhabitants of the city of Jerusalem were able to protect its inhabitants.
He's comfortable with Mr. Liggerberg's war group in January 22 January.
Why would these false Philistines be embarrassed by giving them their own government?
If they really run the West City, don't they really shoot cars like they do in Gasaz?
It's better to keep them behind the wall and punish their heads when they lift their heads.
Maybe the reporters win, but he can change the ranges.
The experts have won the power in Egypt, and others love Israel much, even if they love Israel’s former home.
The nation of Israel is greater than the Arab neighbors.
To start with the local superpower, the new Arab government doesn't help their economy.
Pragstic Mr. Mr. Murur worked with Bagel Omma, and maybe something could be the beginning of something.
The Israelites should take a long time.
As the rest of the Arab world is becoming more horrifying the rest of the world, the exception of the Philistines is that there's a lot of difficulties in Israel, such as an invasion of the nation of Israel.
He's already in the Jewish government, and he's already getting the pressure to grow up, and he's getting an adhesive.
In every few years, there will be an incubator in a diato with blood trained to defeat Hammas.
He needs treatment on both sides.
And most of them live on both sides of the world and this world, and this world that is based on the two generals of Israel’s safety; the nation of Israel is ruled by the nation of Israel.
You're going to have a little hope in the long line, which is going to give the stranger a little bit more pressure.
Now that the war should start to stop Gazzeze, Turkey, Turkey, and Katara and Kamma's idea of change in the land is a far better place than any other country.
The foreign Arabs must be forced to settle the Hammas and Fabara.
It's much more useful than the UN's offering a state of government in the United Nations.
Mr. Obama is playing the role in bringing Israel to the table.
In the first century, he failed to offer his own peace plans.
Looks like he's desperate about being taken in White House.
This doesn't seem to be in a sad way.
America's stability is in Central East.
That means peace between Israel and Philistines.

He said he didn't have anything to do with anything.

Besides, I'm a nurse.
I'm connecting to a diaper.
I'm still working on a job.
Can I get the cost for a month?
- Bet Bey's past.
You didn't say you were at the first time in the matter of the problem.
But let's tell you how to make sure that you will be blessed.
First of all, the most important thing in the law is that he's been a insurance company since 10 years, and it's supposed to be your day.
Besides, you're also given at least 60 percent of the strength of your work, or the loss of a job job crisis or a job job job loss at least 60 percent.
But because you're in here, you're able to provide 60 percent of your breast disease, you're not able to fill the amount of $800 days in order that you can't fill up the number of days.
Of course, we don't know how many years you've worked.
On the day of ten days you've completed your ten years and 18th day, the SGK will be a month of your decision.
Cosmetics for the Moon
Wouldn't anyone be capable for 10 years to be a year-old?
- It's supposed to be a run-by-the-factor.
However, there is only one exception, and he's been informed that the other person has been informed that he's always being paid for a long time, and he's still in contact with the next ten-year-olds.
In addition to writing on the articles that will be published in our publications on the subject of the news of any ill health or anxiety that those with whom they have to take care of will be able to handle it.
What's going on before you start working.
I'm Ahtler.
When I moved all the conditions in SGGK in his law, they said, "You can't buy me for the first time before I went to work, I'm sick."
I'm so sorry.
It's not fair.
How am I supposed to be retired?
- You wrote all the conditions in the Law, Bet, but one of the conditions in the law, and the law is in the law, and there's no need for a patient to be able to work in the law.
It can't be connected to the cost of the amount you're not carrying.
However, when I close the age insurance, you can be retired when you move the conditions.
- I have 39 days, and I've been insurance for 16 years.
It was identified by SGK before my job began.
They told me you couldn't be retired.
In this case, I'll do what I'll do.
I won't.
Are you on your way?
- Yes, you heard right.
You can't be retired.
But the SGK law says there's a financial rule for you.
Well, there's two situations before 2008 and after October.
The first time you start working on this date, the SGK, you can determine that you've had at least 36 years before you're paid from work.
Therefore, we will recommend you to the nearest SGK Office of the United States.
- Well, since 2008, you've been in business, then you may have been able to report to at least 360 days of smoking and death.
Are you sure you're going to leave the job?
I still work as a driver.
When I went to the hospital, the cancer met me.
I want to be retired.
In this case, do I need to leave your job?
Can't I handle the cost of wealth without leaving?
I don't want to be without a job until it's stuck.
- You heard right.
You have to be separated to give you the opportunity to give up on the perimeter.
But before you go to the moon, you need to be treated by the SGGK law.
But if you are poor, it will be a full month of blessings for you.
You don't have any reason to be tied up for a month, you have to risk unnecessary labor.
It's enough for you to have 1600 days for that.
When you give the SGK to find my property, the SGK will love you for one of the grown-ups.
And when you're here, you're going to get your health report here (GKK), you'll be able to apply the SKK, and you'll have a decision to support your health and your patient's health.
However, if you need to fill up your moon for ten years, you will be able to fill it up to you, as long as it takes ten years to fill it.
So we can say that as soon as we can say, the non-dvisors who are working at the SGK health board isn't going to be able to make the decision to see the unprovok.
But if the insurance insurances carry all the conditions, the SGK could be asked to determine the cost and connection.
If this happens, and other things carry on, it can be useful for a little bit of a month early.
Do you think the child owes the Fish-Kur?
I'm the Bag-Kur insurance.
I carry all the conditions.
But they said you can't get paid because I owe you.
What should I do?
- I'll take care of it.
Whoever told you was telling me the truth.
You don't write what the other terms are, but if you think you're carrying these conditions, it's hard to pay your debt.
But I can give you a special tilt.
I would recommend you to pay for your debt banks or those similar projects.
As soon as it gets over the month, you get too much, and you pay for your debt first.
This will make it easy for you to pay for your month.
What status is bound to be associated with?
I worked as the SSK and Bag-Kur and E-Curan.
When I deserve the moon, where will it be brought to me for months?
- I'm telling you, if you're working for more than one month, the last month of a cigarette, and the next month, you're going to have to get to the SS.K.S., which is the last place where you're going to get a cigarette, and you're still on the other side of SKS.K.
SGK also reports to the hospital report.
How do you apply the suggestion?
What hospital do I have to do with health report?
- You're connected to health reports for health reports, and you'll have enough use of social security services or social security centres.
SGK will allow you to study health and studies at the University of University, University, University of the University, and the U.S.
However, it can also be done in the case of those patients who don't find it. If you do, however, your health care can also be done with the full - time medical treatment.
It's possible to love a private hospital, right?
- It's possible, but there's only conditions.
In the old order to be in the former hospital alone, the patient and the patient will be able to be able to move to the hospital with a new patient who will be able to be able to move to the hospital and who will be able to be able to move to the new hospital, where the patient will be able to move and care for other patients who will be able to be able to survive.
What's going on with the demand for love operation?
It's enough for me to be able to determine the cost of the insurance cost of the insurance company.
Your relationship to the hospital will be paid by SGK.
And it's not going to be called a insurance process for ten years.
In the case of the financial program, if it's connected to a person's status, it's not only about 18,000 days of age, but it's not enough to find out if it's just 10 years of insurance.
For that reason, when the first person found the first time he found his property, SGGK is on its way to be able to obtain the cost of money.

A message that comes after half an hour.
Dennisssa found the bottle in the U.S. for 50 years before she was thrown into the Atlantic Ocean.
Cam bottles of bottle, the year we passed on to the United States, after the beginning of the year, he left a place around the house of Sandy Kasshi.
In the letter, please contact the following questions and address the address address.
It's a scientific research based on Dennis Kosta (12).
In the summer, she's asked to tell you where she found, where and how she found it.
It also takes money to pay for an e-mail and mail.
In New Jersey, nearly 35 miles [320 km] from the ocean, we received a history of history during the time of August 16, 1963.
When Kosa was 12 years old, she said she was about half-old, and then she said, "I didn't think she'd be able to find something, but I didn't think she'd come back to me."
The sound is in love with the frequency.
I was surprised to tell you what Turkey's first sound was going to do with the Pamir's voices, and I was surprised.
When you say sound technology or sound technology, everyone seems to have a sound system on music.
Well, you know, you know, if you're able to prevent my voice from mixing with technology, you know that the person you want to be able to kill you, you can make you want to be an immortal murder, or you can make a secret for yourself?
By the end of the United States, the U.S.A. was released in the United States after the D.S.A.'s voice was finished in the United States, and he was able to give up his voice to the U.S.
The connection to the Beyotasa Musical Musical Music Library also has the ability to perform music, technology, technology, technology, technology, technology, technology, technology, technology, technology, technology, technology.
Message of theunited ministry
"What's all the noise?" I'm the first question.
"A technology that is used in many areas.
All our brains are used to have power users.
The sound frequency also has some kind of electricity, energy.
By using this energy, you can change the mind of the people you want to move in with the command you want."
It's one of the most important things of the sound technology, and the officer's message.
The music or singing of the song is placed in the front of the person's hearing, but it's not known by the top of the list.
For example, when an terrorist attacks, as noted, it may be a music release to the region.
If there's a text message that's changed to the original song, it's like a text-to-do, like a text message, the terrorist will notice that the driver was able to do this attack.
We don't understand what it's like, but it's like, uh, it's like, uh... it's like, uh, it's like, uh... it's just like, uh... it's just like, uh... it's not like a voice.
In fact, they can see that from which they are warned.
However, in the world and Turkey, there is certainly no law and penalty for public security.
It's a message for an officer who's only prepared to teach students about a college college.
"As long as it's time, I've heard a music student.
I put a sound in the music.
I finally asked the students to shut up and shut up.
They say they're all filled with water." This experience is the experience.
According to Pamir, we have access messages as fugitives, and some radio signals were detected, but they don't know that yet.
In Germany, there's a channel called the "Kra's Sound Radio" is a focalypse.
Sublimal attacks by the way he's been attacked by the way he's been attacked by religion, a religious, advisory call, the command to use drugs.
The German police also know that, but the Turkish police don't always get up because they're changing. "
And it's also using such dangerous messages in the music world.
Especially in the song of some giant metal bands...
According to these claims, there was no terrorists in the flights, and there was no terrorists who were under attackers.

The sound technology can be used in crime events.
The U.S.'s particularly in the banks of the bank.
For example, when the police are on the phone contact with the police, they can find out which person is in the room in the bank.
It's different when you hit a sound, a bacon, a platoon, or something else.
It may also be possible to identify the size of the room that was found in the sound of the voice.
As a result, what kind of things is found in the voice of the guilty may be considered in a private room.
There's a computer program used for this program, which has even made a program of this program from Tatartara, which was able to build a sound of how to build the sound of the design of the building.
Not a expensive technology, but 45,000 worth.
It's also used in sound frequency and decoration.
Pamir has a lot to do about it.
For example, his men went to work, and a restaurant made it out of a restaurant where the voice meetings were done, and the sound was not removed from the table.
Only those talking on the table can only hear those on the table.
Two other steps, someone else can't hear anything on the table.
It's the general system of this kind of order: if you want to destroy it, you can turn it into the same sound and turn it into another sound.
If this system wasn't a system, no one could fly.
Because the sound of the plane engines is too high enough to survive.
In the plane they will destroy one another.
Even if this system is open with your windows, you can create a peaceful environment around your home."
Is it in the sound of Egypt?
Turkey's first sound has other interesting things he did, Pamir.
For example, he made a plan that he couldn't hear the music out of the moon.
He can't go beyond the limit of sounding, and he's being replaced with another voice.
Even in a room, even after a certain point in a room, it can be quiet.
Pamir has already brought his school's sport and sports for sports and cosmetics.
I mean, double-five.
Because while playing basketball, there's a need for burnout, but there's got to be no heat in the concerts.
It's only possible to make a sound of the music that can be heard in open seats.
"We use the words that are being heard in a loud voice and cut off the voice of the person's music, making it easier for him to take the music.
MTV's too far ahead of this.
The open concerts are playing and its voice sounds like the studio is being heard."
That's what Tuffak did.
With the sound frequency, separate two albums from each other.
There's some scientists who claim that Egypt had made it sound with voice.
They thought the stones might have been put up with voice and placed.
I'm asking, "Why don't you be able to use bad purposes?"
"When I read the work of New York University on the Internet, I was afraid to read or read.
Because even good people who wish to be well-off have been told that there can be a reason for the possibility that the labs are out of control."
"The streets have been affected with Arabic."
Paul SENA, who said that people are being affected by human behavior, explains: “The sound of the ear is being heard by all brains.
Still, the person hears the sound that he's alone, but other voices are actually on the brain, and he's actually getting tired and tired.
That's why we need to clear up your brain, so walking naked in the land, doing natural things.
I think it's necessary to order the noise of the school.
So the student can concentrate on the voice of teaching alone, and for a long time, it can help him to remain calm."
And because of the nature of the sound frequencys, Paul says that the prayers of the Arabs are very effective, and he says that while he says that he is very rich, he will be careful that he has a very poor heart.
"But I'm going to read the prayers.

"Is it possible to fall in love with one person's frequency?"
Don't fall in love with Pamir's feelings, the more the more true person will have to find the answer that you want to use when you want to talk to someone you want to love.
You can impress it by using a higher frequency than that.
For example, let us think that the pressure rate of a person is 300.

When the politicians in the world say that they have special sound systems to speak more effectively in the world, Paul may feel that the sound of singing is very powerful, very powerful.
"What makes the voice of the person who's voice that will be replaced by Japan on the Day of the Day of the Day is saying, "How close is the voice of the person who's voice is very close to the voice?"
It will be a wonderful gift, which will be given to human beings like unto the breath of flesh."
