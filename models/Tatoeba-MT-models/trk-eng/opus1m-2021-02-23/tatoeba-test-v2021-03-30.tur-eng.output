Can you buy something when you get back?
Tom's a great man.
Don't do that again.
Please don't ask me.
Mary's not jealous.
She's taking a six-five match.
My heart is yours.
I'm going to sleep here.
It'll take a long time to do this.
I'll let you explain.
Tom's a history teacher.
I'll go with you to see the doctor.
Where can I buy a mao?
What movies have you seen lately?
Whatever you do, don't put this rope down.
You think Tom's gonna let me win?
I'm gonna blow your head off.
Don't stop with me.
Tom and Mary were crying.
Tom's in Boston for business.
That's very expensive for me.
I can help you do that if you want.
I know more about you than you.
I'm very glad of my job.
I doubt it.
Tom and I have a beautiful house.
Is death only possible?
You're saying you can't fix it?
Tom will be waiting for me.
You should teach the children the truth.
Do this before the weather starts.
It's sent to a start with flowers growing over.
Young people must follow law.
Why did they arrest him?
I decided we had to do it.
Tom's probably afraid.
As a grateful, she gave me this baby.
Tom refused to give details.
I want another beer.
You don't love me!
These flowers may have caused it to warm global heat.
Just relax, Tom, you're doing great.
I thought Mary said she wasn't a boyfriend.
Tom's slow, isn't he?
He gave up plans to go to Boston.
We bought Tom a birthday present.
You have to do it if you don't want it.
The press's in trouble.
Let's help Tom.
Well, I think Tom and Mary were taken off.
No one has time for her.
When I'm there, she was just ready to go.
Tom always tells him.
Am I the only one who thinks it's wrong?
Emily let me live with him.
The source water is very clean.
Tom, he lives with Mary in Memphis.
I'll pray for Tom.
The charges against Tom were dropped.
Hey, listen to this.
How about we buy a drink?
Tom grew close, but he's not a good face.
There's a car coming closer.
Good ladies.
We're not very busy yet.
He spoke to people around him gently.
Tom, it wasn't as active as Mary looks.
Tom Mary knew why John got hurt.
I think you're worried about Tom.
We're hoping to close the open.
Tom, she realized that Mary must see someone else.
I agree with you in that case.
I think Tom was proud of himself.
The scientists stopped believing that they were the smallest part of atoms of mine long ago.
Did you get everything you want?
My friend took 95 points on his math exam.
It's the way to the hotel.
I wouldn't care.
We wanted to help them.
Who thought Tom would want to stay for three hours?
He wasn't the only student who didn't come.
Tom spent the whole morning in an investigation room.
You don't want to go, do you?
You won't kiss Tom?
Tom usually goes to school with Mary.
That's a problem, it's hard to explain.
I'm sure Tom didn't know he had to do that.
They like stories.
Tom, she can't do anything without Mary's help.
Tom Mary's office was hard.
Just do your best.
I'm not sure Tom's here.
I thought you didn't smoke.
We've all worked really hard.
This mystery disaster struck all the village.
I was surprised when Tom told me that Mary left Boston.
Tom grew up in a small town not far from here.
I didn't shoot anybody.
Tom, Mary found out she couldn't possibly do it.
Now we're waiting for the results.
He gave me the phone number.
There's no secret Tom's hiding from me.
I thought you were someone else.
You're a good mother.
You asked Tom how to do that, didn't you?
Mary, my love!
Dan had to decide who he would believe.
I don't think Tom knows why Mary came to see him.
I argued with Tom.
Lela wanted to make a personal phone call.
You want to pay, don't you?
Our problem is still the same.
The prices of their treasure have fallen down.
I did it exactly like Tom did.
We ran in the park.
Tom can sing better than anyone else.
The world's coming back.
I want to see you back tomorrow.
If I'm late, I'll be on it.
Everyone hates separatedrs.
I'm just listening to the radio on these days.
We're having a lot of fun.
Tom's got reasons to do it.
He wanted me to lie.
It's time to start.
You're all fucked up.
From the moment he got there, he continued to bother the doctor to tell him when he could go home.
What are you doing now?
It doesn't look like Tom.
The witch moved to Kahire.
Tom will be disappointed if you hear you talk like that.
He's still 20 years old.
He got a call from Tom Mary.
Are you ready for Halloween?
The only complaint Tom did.
I gotta hurry.
I have to admit things seem pretty good.
Which word do you usually use?
I asked Tom the first time he and Mary met.
I'm waiting for a call from Tom.
I used the glass to clear my wife in my window.
You'll find a drop in the club.
The writers always have to have the last word.
The colors speak all languages.
Aren't you supposed to be on someone for 20 years to do that?
Here comes the bus.
Why didn't you just want me to help you?
Mary's got some fake dirty stuff.
Those rules increased the happiness between students.
Tom didn't do anything all morning.
We got position.
I didn't know anyone there.
He burned Tom Mary's picture.
It's been a hard year for me.
Tom came back to his car and took a hand.
The soil was soft.
"Tatoeaba is not a Japanese girl," she says, "If she's your Japanese girlfriend."
Mary may be getting back.
Tom's doing very well.
Everybody calm down, please.
A ship's got ironed on the dock.
I want to know everything you know.
Tom doesn't have to help.
Good luck!
You're up for late hours.
We dance together.
Why aren't you at school?
It's a very quiet computer machine.
Why is Tom tired?
Tom's great.
It's a nice day out there.
Tom left prints in the door at the door that he found the body.
Do you still need our help?
Please return to the left.
I'm trying to get this idea into the heads of the students.
I watched Tom into the living room.
Tom said he didn't have a choice.
Both of you congratulations.
Tom always says you have to say the truth.
Tom's sleeping now.
Tom shot him.
I know you want to do this.
My father and my brother work in this factory.
I talked to friends.
I haven't been wearing this for years.
I remember seeing a picture of you and Tom together.
There were a lot of people in the funeral.
It's the best decision I've ever made in the move.
The water's been thrown into the water.
I'd like to hear him from him.
Tom Mary knows she's going to Boston.
This is suicide.
Mary gave it to Tom for his birthday.
There's no reason to trust Tom's Mary.
Tom wasn't the only one who couldn't speak French in the room.
Tom's been prepared very well.
If you could help me a little, it would be nice.
I can die tomorrow.
Tell your son that he doesn't want my daughter anymore.

Nobody knows he loves her.
He's always excited.
That's very useful.
I'm learning Navajo.
I want to live in Boston as much as you.
Tom's gonna be fine.
Who told Tom to sing?
My son's not the only one who likes what he cooks.
Why are you doing this to him?
Tom's the one who has to do this.
I'm sorry, but I can't have dinner with you.
What are the other guys doing?
I need to know when we're supposed to be there.
He left his country two years ago.
That was boring.
Tom's never going back here, is he?
My favorite bike is the Singola.
I hated them.

They gave me their clothes and food.
Tom's not contracting.
He didn't want to hug Tom Mary.

I pushed him into my house.
I tried again, but don't worry about it.
I want my own room.
Don't you think we're pretty good excuses?

He's not willing.
I can see him in my dreams.
He's right.

I think you should meet Tom.
I usually keep a day when I travel.
We've never been to Boston.
This is your chance, Tom.
I won't get away with them.
I don't have any more questions.
Mary paid five bucks for lunch.
Almost write it.
Did you know you were the Embassy closet?

What did he do to you?
Tell Tom how to get to the beach.
