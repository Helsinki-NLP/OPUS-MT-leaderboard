Norvech's cancer: is this the world's favorite fish?
He's enjoying five million people of Norway's highest life standards, not only in Europe but in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be associated with the local trade with some fish?
Once you've picked a past cheese.
Put these in the middle of a dirty, wet football form.
Leave it for a week.
Now, one of the big Norway tastes to fit your nose, you have a cancer smell.
I'm in the small Fagernes town, about three hours from Oslo.
There's a snow, a great view, and this smell always depends on the air.
Raffics is set up and water is based on how much you smell - the fish you're enjoying for a year.
When it's dark and cool, Norwegians are gathered here for this most magical dinner.
The full-time firefighter and the word "Rakfisky General" Airrd Halvarssen, says, "You're gonna eat this, then you'll eat a glass of a glass."
People around us eat small fish cubes, and they're drinking a lot of wine.
"Some people love aquavit more than cancer."
He can kill the drink.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can get out of the nose, it's not bad, it's not a long bus trip, it's a little different from a sushi.
It's a very different species of water and salt that are expected to survive before Rakfisk Norway's iceband.
Then, when it is in the middle of the winter, lo! it is as if there were a hole in the ground.
Just a generation ago, it was forced to leave the countries to search for thousands of Norwegian jobs, most of them moved to the United States.
Now the population is rapidly expanding - more than 13% of workers are being transferred by high cost, high cost, and closed care systems.
People in Sweden, who are richer than Norway soon.
Raffics represents something important, even though Norway's history is a little smelly.
Among the most expensive food you can buy.
But everything is expensive — a small beer or a sandwich is $9 (14).
Norway doesn't often come to the global news day, and most people like that.
People here are still not willing to talk about the name of Anders Breivic who killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, it's called "22 July".
The Norwegians are forced to believe that one of them could be a harsh and murder like this.
The growth of one of the world's largest oil oil and gas industry since the early 1970s.
"But the oil is not the only reason we're doing well."
So how are we to be generous people?
English, like most people here, are perfect.
We're not very influential, we don't like surprises.
The Norwegian oil wealth was very careful, but only a small percentage of the money from the industrial is going to be paid for the benefit of all of the future generations.
During the years when everyone else had the money that everyone else had, he tied up the rope of Norway's bag in the global crisis.
"We're happy as long as we can make a summer walk," Anna says.
And it's like, "and roraff's seven," and it's a comfortable hero.
I'm standing in the snow and waiting for something to eat — I've had enough cancer.
Now a keburger is absolutely different and has a delicious taste.
But there's more of that smell than that.
One of the numbers of hotels that I'm staying for rakystic dinner are the best, and maybe they're putting the nose into the roughest fish.
There's a live television connection on a papion server with rakfix tables.
It's like Eurovision song racing.
"How many points do you have for the best fish in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"We're here, Aird."
It's drinking, jokes.
A man falls from his chair, maybe the influence of aquavit.
Or maybe the smell of all these fishes.
Mexican Enrique Penna Nieto encounters violence
While the new president of Mexico's new president Enrique Pena Nieto is planning to visit the office, Will Grant is looking at the hardships and hardships of the people of the BBC.
Now, Mexico's traffic is very bad.
During the best times, it has caused chaos on a global scale that cut out various main roles in the capital on Monday.
But the purpose was not to prevent people from going to work, but to stop the protesters from reaching the council.
>>uzb_Latn<< On Saturday, the new president of Mexico will take Enrique Pena Nieto, who will take the presidential throne, and will carry out its national commission.
He's against a tough mission.
Meanwhile, Fifie Calderon had a good performance in Mexico's economy, but the country is under control of a drug war that has been discovered in 60,000 years ago.
Mr. Pena Nieto said to the U.S. President Baack Obama this week, "There is a great promise for the people of Mexico to reduce the violence."
I'm going to offer a new security strategy to help us reach this goal.
Prior to giving Mr. Pena Nieto's former political experiment before giving him our shoulder to the U.S. President, Mr. Pena Nieto was a state state of Mexico.
The population of the capital is divided into this state of growth, so the new leader in the old neighborhood is divided.
A man of openness
For example, it's remembered with the love of a broken Vale del Bravo town.
Those who live here are convinced that they think of tourism and create the sixteenth game.
To reach town, you can go from Mr. Pena Nieto's new highway, a big move from the
Besides the modern sports center and the impressive climate change museum, plaques carry their name.
"We're looking for him to bring him a change of determination and permanent change," says Mr. Pena Nieto's friend, and a member of the political party, Gabriel Olivera Hernandez.
Especially from security and economy, we hope to have an interesting and real change that our country needs very much.
After 81 years of unexplained power, PRI was captured by Vincent Fox in 2000.
Congress President Olivera admits that after 12 years outside the Los Pinos Presidential palace, Enrique Pena Nieto has been very unexpected.
And the opposition refuses to acknowledge the new president.
He's a clear man, he's calling himself a great country virus.
A man who knows how to listen to a great government man and all of them.
But on the other side of the state, that's not the idea that many people have the old governors.
Cicudad Neza could not have been more cut off by Valle del Bravo's park streets, known as the Nezad Neza.
It's a bank of Mexico City under the highway.
And the problems in the city are hard, and the city is stable.
This year, the army was called to help the drug gangs working in the neighborhood, and it was especially violent against women.
The body of a dead woman had been murdered only in two years, just in a empty field of burying area.
More than 1,000 women were killed in Mexico during the time of Mr. Pena Nieto.
Mr. Pena Nieto said that even when he was in the best position, women couldn't reach enough of the murder problem.
In the worst, they blame him for having to ignore his authority.
In a typical prison house, Irina Buendia, a sister of mine, is trying to fight Maria Luna's pictures while showing me pictures of Maria Luna.
According to the official version of events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But his family believed he was killed by his partner.
"As if I went home, it was as if the body had been washed."
There were signs to show that he was beaten, and death was already over.
When his mother reshapes the story, Maria's looking down a picture wall, with one word on it: Justice.
But that's what the family said that they were completely rejected.
The state officials treated me as an old gossiper, trouble-aggressive, nervous.
What they want is what people say, simply accept what they say and close their mouth.
But that's not true when there's so much order and lack of it."
President Pena Nieto comes with heavy responsibility when she picks up a bird on Saturday.
Over the next six years, tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico and promised to give them priority during the new presidential mission.
"He's the president of the PRI Congress," says Olivera, Valle del Bravo.
But that's the most fear of the victims of the victims in Cuudad Neza.
Bradley didn't complain about Man's acting bad, the prosecutors.
The prosecutors are trying to resist Bradley Mannning's claim to use evil
During the trial, Mannning's army in Quantico is focusing on the time he stays in prison in Virginia.
The defense wants Mannning to close the case because he's forced to jail.
The army is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents
The prosecutors tried to say that Erdley Mannning's opportunity to complain about the bad behaviors he lived during the military trial on Friday, with the greatest secret material in the U.S. history of the United States.
During the trial in Ft.
A day after he had been arrested and sentenced to imprisonment for his execution, the official question of Mannning's decision to end his case in the custody of Man's.
In June 2010, the army arrested was accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while working in Iraq.
>>uzb_Latn<< The material was later published online by WikiLeaks.
The WikiLeaks never confirmed Mann's source of information.
During the Friday trial, Fein, who had been arrested for being held in Quantico's military prison in June 2010, after the meeting with Mannin, was held in prison in Quantico's prison in April 2010.
The officers have asked Manning questions and have notes on their answers.
When Fein asked questions about forms on Friday, Mann said that the behaviors performed by the guards were "middle" and the behaviors in all facility were "a lot professional."
Forms don't show any complaints, but the officer asks Mannning about right conduct, Fin.
Mann asked about his concerns and told the visitors that they were concerned about their concerns, but they answered that they were not able to tell them about them.
Manning said, "It doesn't mean that he didn't say what he wrote and that he didn't want anything."
Judge Denise Lind said that he didn't complain about the murders he had made during the January 2011 meeting of January 2011.
He answered that Man's intentions were to be removed at the meeting.
The army told him to put him in a limited state of suicide in order to protect himself and others.
"I wanted to know I'm good, and I wanted to get out of the POI situation, to enjoy the quality of life that is greater than my perspective."
On Thursday, Man's arrest was arrested in Iraq, and in June 2010, Marine Base Quantico reported a transfer to Kuvey that had been held nearly two months before the military was transferred to the prison in Virginia.
He said he thought suicide in Kuvety and he loved him once over there because of the heat.
She told her that she wasn't allowed to know what happened and what happened in the outside world.
"My world was thrown down to Camp Arafjon," said Man's Day.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
When Mann went to Quantico, he said he spent most of his days alone in a small cell with at least 21 hours and often over 23 hours.
Man's only bed, blankets, fingertips, some clothes and glasses are given.
He's trying to move because he said it's against the rules of sleep and even in the day.
Mann said he always slept with the light that comes out of his cell.
When he turns back at night, the guards told him to wake him up and turn back.
Mannning's lawyer filed a photo of Mann's behavior in January 2011.
In April 2011, Mann moved to Fort Levawworth, Kansas.
He also asked the judge Mann on Friday that he was forced to sleep naked in his cell on Thursday night in Quantico, and in the morning he was forced to stand up in front of the guards and other prisoners.
Man said he wasn't able to cover himself with the blanket during the count.
At the trial of the judge on Friday, Mann said that he had to throw a blanket from the order of the guards that could hold him off, but nobody ordered him to throw him off.
On Thursday, Mann said that he was forced to sleep naked the other night because he tried to prove that he wasn't a threat to himself.
Man's officer said that he could hurt himself by using his noses or fingertips, but he didn't do it.
Manning said that that night his underwear was taken from the cell of his fingers, between his fingers and his glasses.
At least the attorney hopes that at least the judge will pay his experiences in prison and that he will be sentenced to death in the next year's sentence will decrease his punishment in the case of a military court waiting for the next year.
The Defense said Manning would take action to blame for his minor crimes and fight overly.
The trial was planned at the end of this week, and the prosecutors are expected to argue about the condition of the state.
Pentagon said Mann's entire maximum custody in Quantico was set up according to the rules.
To help Mandin's enemies, to help the enemy, to be sent online, to communicate national defense information, and to sell public rights or records.
If he's in charge of all my claims, he can face life in prison.
>>uzb_Latn<< American identity crisis
Many people say it's hard for them to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunity here.
Mexicans are on the edge of the desert, they remind the Mexicans of the difficult times.
In Navarre says the Mexican Americans are stuck between two worlds.
I've been in a country where I've been in a close trip to Mexico City, and I'm surprised to be moved back.
The marks were showing two lines: one for "Mexicanos", the other for "Extranjeros"
I stood there a few seconds, I wasn't sure where I was going.
I've been called "Messical" all my life since I grew up in California.
In this ethnic steno, my friends in Boston say they are Irish, or my friends in New York call them "Itan."
Then I decided in Mexico.
But it was Mexico.
And my grandpa didn't need a studio or a hotel at my grandfather's council.
I was easily American.
I'm speaking Spanish, I'm good enough to run both sides of a conversation.
But I don't have your local words and I can't get rid of my American accent.
That's why I got my U.S. passport and I went for Extranjeros.
I thought it was the moment when Enrique Pena Neeto visited the White House to meet President Obama this week.
Every time two countries meet their leaders in my day, it's always as usual: migration, drug and commercial.
Pena Nieto also encouraged the Mexicans to talk about growing up in Mexico as far as the possibility of staying in Mexico as possible.
He wants to be associated with the United States and Canada, and he wants to build a trading block in the European Union in North America.
Although Pena Nieto did not suggest anything, he swore that Mexico would continue fighting drug carts.
For Mexico, there's complicated and negative feelings.
Most Americans probably didn't even think that the United States worked in 1848 and forced the leaders of the United States to force half of their land into a rifle.
But not for minutes, for the Mexicans who think in some centuries.
So when a U.S. authorities say a little bit of criticism about Mexico, you start to complain about the influence of the Americans in Mexico and between the Americans.
And Montezuma's children go to war.
And yet, it's a really hard relations for Mexico with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about negative feelings?
There's a lot.
In Mexico, there are people who won and lost the opportunity of the country and who didn't create it.
The only reason that many people in Mexico have to live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denmark, and San Antonio is to stay in our village is to stay outside our country, perhaps a young brother or a great parents or father.
And most of all, it's like a profile -- a dark body, less education, a poor village vs.
It is We who have given them their share, and We are constant to them.
Not Mexico.
And now we're not living in the American dream, but we're going to a good school and we're never gonna miss the fact that it's the American Dream, not Mexico.
Our identity may be unknown, but our loyalty is open.
United States.
Besides, we realize that most of the senior Mexicans in the manager class don't like us.
That's the feeling.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat, and they're looking up above us like we've not been in Mexico.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, and our ties with Mexico are never strong enough.
Our existence is about the total failure of their eyes.
If our families weren't successful in Mexico, they wouldn't go.
And now we're not able to find ourselves behind the rope curtain, but they're still missing spirits.
My wife was born in Guadalajara, and when she was a kid in the United States, she reminded me that the Mexicans were more demanding and that the Mexican Americans would be involved in it.
Despite being a U.S. citizen, he views himself as part of the two countries.
At the same time, most Americans I know don't feel like part of them.
We also like to listen to Los Tigres del Norte and Bruce Springstein.
You're taking the best of the two worlds, but you're not one of them.
We're seeing Americans in Mexico.
We are adopted as Mexicans in the United States.
Now, as I learned about the relationship further, some Mexican leaders and lights want to connect with Diaspora with Diaspora.
To show interest in the United States, Mexican Americans want to run as temporary Mexicans.
We'll have to tell the Americans what a beautiful country like us, and we'll have to force political leaders to strengthen their bonds with Mexico.
Yeah.
That won't happen.
There's too much positive feelings.
And we're not sure that it's a great country with the presence of comeness, and the violence of the drug violence and that most of us are not.
I'm afraid you're alone, friends.
>>uzb_Latn<< It's fair.
At least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive Mexico a hundred and a half years ago because of their conduct to Mexico, and then some Mexican Americans still have to accept that they have to remain calm for their family members more recently.
Hmm.
Maybe more than I thought.
Old Wars, New Middle East
The fire between Israel and Hamas could be a major foundation for peace.
Is there always peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
There's another blood cover showing that there's no hope for such a hope.
Among the unexplained debate about who started, the building was turned into an enzyme, most of the 140 Israeli and six Israelites, and the great city of Israel from the Great Lake of Telv and the Holy City of Jerusalem was first visited by the city of Telv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, even though the Israelites and the Philistines were forced to fight in their former conflicts, the Middle East changes around them.
The barley price went down, and did not like or like it, and the Philistines and the Israelites were caught in a regional campaign.
Maybe this makes them more blood than they used to do.
But there are good reasons to think that this could destroy their lives.
What a victory that won is
In the first look, it seems hard to be right now.
Even though the fires received on November 21, this week, the war increased both sides.
Since 2007, the Islamic leader of the Islamic leaders of Gasze, who ruled Gazze, will claim that they forced the Israelites to return.
He failed to destroy Israel Hamas, even though he killed some of their leaders and 1.7 million of Gazze's people in one of the worst and most violent regions of the world.
Of course, the other part of Hamas Filistin is now taking over the middle fleet's fight in Western Sheria.
Besides, the leaders of Hamas can also take the end of the time.
In the Arab world, Islam gained strength and rich friends.
The most recently restored regional power of Israel was Turkey, one of the riches and most powerful powers of the Korean states.
Happy Hamas people believe that the Islamic nation of Islamic Israel could move north from Lübban to Syria and threaten the king of the Islamic city of Syria.
Nearly all of them changed the glory of the Muslim Kargers in Egypt under the Arab wing of Israel.
He had a very short time leading the laser, who ruled Egypt for 30 years before his fall in 2011.
In contrast, brother Hamas's cousin and leader are more involved in society.
In the future, Hamas, Israel and America, can be identified as an actor who cannot be prevented.
During this time, Israel's guards will be able to handle completely the opposite results.
The soldier was put back in the Hamas box.
Israel's Iron Cup proved the value of anti-oxide system, and many of Hamas' missiles were destroyed.
The Israelites will be more comfortable for a while.
Diplomaticly, the U.S. government of Europe has accused Hamas of starting the last violent events.
On the other hand, Israel grew up in the administration of the former governor Benjamin Netanayahu, who did not see the peace process at all.
Although the rockets from Gazze have killed nearly 30 Israelites since 2004, Israel was able to escape from a number of suicide bombers that continued to expand the southern part of the state of Poland and continued to increase the country’s borders.
The Likud party is comfortable with Mr. Netanayahu, together with the more war group on January 22, 22.
Why would these false Philistines glorify their nation by giving them their own powers?
If they really run West City, wouldn't they fire a rocket like the one they did in Gazze?
It's better to hold them behind the wall and punish them when they lift their heads.
Maybe the reporters win, but the Arab price can change their accounts.
If the Islamic people gain power in Egypt, and the other places love Israel, they are fighting hard in their homes.
Israel's defense budget is greater than the merger of Arab neighbors.
The launch of the local superpower doesn't help the new Arab governments improve their economy.
Pragmatic Mr. Mursi worked with Baack Obama to make a fire that looks good.
The Israelites need to take a long time.
As the rest of the Arab world became more democratic, abandoning the Philistines to their own rights, one day, like a bus that explodes in Israel under the labor camp in the region of Israel.
The pressure in the Jewish state is already on the demography, and the Arab population's growing up.
In a couple of years, blood pressure against Gazze will lead to a diplomatic price that will grow up against Gazze.
Both sides need a cure.
There are two separate countries, which are spoken of as separate world and this newspaper: the two states that Israel's territory represented for security.
You have a small hope in a short time, which will give you a little more pressure to strangers.
Now it's a better place to persuade Gazze to stop the weapons flow with Egypt, Turkey and Katar in 1967 to convince the Jewish government to change the mind of the land and to agree with the common Kudus.
The foreign Arabs also have to force Hamas and Fataba to unite.
It'll be much more useful than a virtual revolution in the United Nations about creating a political revolution.
Mr. Obama also plays a role in bringing Israel to the table.
In the first century, he focused on offering his own peace plan.
It seems impossible to get inside in the White House.
This doesn't seem to be a lot more painful.
America has a lifeline in a stable Middle East.
That means a peace agreement between Israel and the Philistines.
Cigarette storage laws enter Australia
Drinking warnings and sickening organs are placed in green boxes for all the tobacco stores
In the world of Australia's first laws on smoking and tobacco, the market logos and colors are usually cut down to the public greenhouses, the birth of sick boy and his parents.
The only difference between local health warnings and images is that the only difference between the packages is that the market names will be the same size as on Saturday.
It's the biggest regiment for the removal of tobacco in this world.
Australia's federal government says that the purpose is to prevent young people from smoking because of their greed.
If this doesn't start smoking until the age of 26, 99% of the studies that show that they will never start.
"You can see that even young children are trying to sell their tobacco companies from the market, and for example, they have been taken from the studies that demonstrate the idea of having children's logos in line with the idea of becoming prince.
Australia has one of the worst cigarettes in the world, and changes can be very much influenced by many internationals, but other countries think similar names.
They've made a tough lobster against the law.
He said that they would support commercials if they gave the land to blacks and send cheaper and more expensive cigarettes.
Scott McIntyre "will be a serious consequence of rebellion," British Tobacco from Australia.
People from China and Indonesia will bring more products to sell in Australia's streets.
Others say the laws increase.
About two months ago, Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, lost access to the Sandra Ha cigarette boxes, British Tobacco, England's Imperal Tobacco, Philip Morris, and Japan Tobacco's High Court.
He says Zico sells more than 60,000 sales from the ball and waits for a new stash.
That's a good job for us.
Experts say that the plan of potential intelligence is the socialist culture.
A series of Australian law prohibits television advertising and sports, and many sell cigarettes have moved into the market after they wanted to keep the cigarettes out of places.
Australia has banned local companies and websites, but it can't limit sea level sites.
"If you are in the market and only this small window is to introduce your products," he said.
Freeman reports that YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook were increasing in the "organization" on the social media site.
This is a civilian citizen who really loved his cigarettes, or is a marketing company in it?
British American Tobacco said that Australia has focused on dealing with new rules from marketing.
The Industries went to Ukraine to pay for new laws to Honduras and Dominican Republic, which claimed that no countries in the World Trade Organization had been dealt with in an unsatisfactory measure.
It's possible that a WTO decision should be made in the middle of 2013.
Plybunk said the government had talks to other countries who thought the same package decisions.
It was the first country in Canada who forced pictures of photos in 2001.
Now these were spread to over 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In England, New Zealand, South Africa and India, more laws are considered.
A lot of cigarettes in Australia challenge the person who smokes.
The pictures don't influence me.
I ignore them.
When we bought a package with a network tumor, Victor El Hage said, "Take a cigarette and put it in place."
To be honest, there's only one reason to leave, and she's my little girl.
In Sydney's center, James Yu, who runs the King of the throne of fire, said he's forced to lock up.
Yu said, "I'm not giving up a delivery, I've been taking one hour, and now I'll take four hours."
"The government must be banned all over, then, okay, well, we're going to shut up the store," he said.
It's not so bad in a world that's always in the Fisht.
I spent five hours waiting in the airport when we had to fly on this Thanksgiving holiday.
So I've had a lot of time to think about being bored.
I'm not going to lie to you.
I don't even talk about shopping for half a day in the airport, even if it's too boring to wait, books, magazines, magazines, and iPhones.
But in a number of ways, some academics and child development experts commend students.
They say it's normal for us and our kids.
Your brain makes it hard to go to interesting tanks, and maybe he's getting more creative.
And most of us don't experience the benefits of being bored from one screen to another.
So we're gonna have to put it on?
Yeah.
And no.
But I'm gonna go back to this.
First of all, being bored with more free time as many people would seem to be, I thought it was a new concept.
Peterohy, a professor of Greek and Roman history at Calgary University in Canada, says it is not.
He said, "In fact, there's a very long history of depression."
There's a wall record of the first hundredth century in the walls of Pompeiii.
And then we're asking how we're being bored.
The problem is that this has been identified in many different ways and has been discussed, John D. Everswood, a psychologist at the University of Canada.
After looking at the study license and put the idea in front of a close-to-one group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and colleagues, he described it as a "supervised, but not being busy."
The thing that separates the militia is not busy, but he wants to be busy.
He said he didn't have anything to do in the Mississippi.
He said, "It's a decrease in the speed of the process by slowing down and slowing down time," he said.
It's very similar to your deployment depression.
But Professor Estwood, who may have been concerned about it, is that people who are tired tend to see the problem as a environment or a world, but people in the depression think they're going to see their problems as themselves.
Sometimes we think we're sick when we're just having trouble concentrations.
Professor Estwood and his colleagues pointed out an old experiment that included a journal of the magazine published by the Psychological Science Research Research Department in September of September.
Some groups have heard a TV program with no voice or attention in the next room, others have heard it very low level, but the third group has never heard the voice.
Those who heard the low-level TV reported more than the other two groups, inconsistencies, and they didn't know why, and they'd have been involved.
Mark J. Fenske, who was trying to focus on a difficult or busy task at Guelph University in Ontario, said he would be frustrated when you try to focus on a difficult or busy task.
On the other hand, when you read something boring, "like looking at bad cars in a factory budget, it can help you get your attention to music that distracts you."
In fact, it is often possible to help the patient to cope with the physical and mental well - being that is often seen as a sign of distress.
"The study shows that children who have been allowed to remain active have learned more and more information than the children who have been forced to remain active," Professor Fenske said.
We're all experimenting with problems at some point, the delay of my flight, a monotonous movie.
But some people tend to be more bored than others.
In the 1980s, researchers developed a "supervised Electoral Inflammatory" in the 1980s.
Many things I've got to do, "I have a lot of things to do," and "I don't have a lot of interest, I don't have time to do anything."
Researcher Stephen Vodanovic, a psychologist at the University of West Florida, said that using such measurements, researchers found that women are more likely to be more concerned with the need of more than girls.
But they're usually a very unusual group of teenagers.
In 1991, the University of Illinois conducted a series of seven times a day communicating with the human and social development professor Reed Larson about 400 teenagers and parents.
They found that they were tired when they were 32 percent tired at school and homework, but 23 percent of them were tired when they were not in school.
On the other hand, they said that parents were tired of 3 percent.
Professor Larson said now that 21 years later, the increase rates would be higher.
But he said that he had no control over what he wanted to do, so he knew that it was "the time of the distress of the disorder. ”
That's why I'm going back to my first question: Is it good for a person to be upset?
Sometimes, because when the research is over, it shows people that they can allow them to get into their social risk, gambling, or material use.
On the other hand, Professor Vodanovich, who has worked for more than two decades, argues the relationship between many philosophers and authorship.
Gary Marcus, a psychologist at N.Y.U., said, "It's the way your brain tells you to do something else."
But the brain doesn't always know the best thing to do.
If you're tired and using this energy to steal and cook, it'll make you happy.
But if you watch television, it can make you happy in a short time, but it won't take long.
That's why if you give your child an iP, you can't be upset anymore, but you don't know whether to play or edit him.
And he said, "It's going to be a transfer to another state of self-regulation."
Your child doesn't just learn to have fun, he's more control over other areas.
I don't think we really want to be bored.
We don't have to be a lot of criticism.
Instead, our goal should be to be comfortable with the rest of the body without playing it all the time for the activity and technology.
Professor Everswood joined.
He said, "We need to put this in more detail, but it's the desire to be associated with something that's painful, unscrupulous."
What people really are really looking for is a way to get out of the fire and enjoy the rest of their time.
They said, "We shall find it hard to recognize the ways of our gods when we are surrounded by a really loud noise."
There is no Senaryo for the New Marihuana Law in Colorado
Anthony Orozco, a regional university student in southern Colorado, and a football player in the South 19th century, confronts the charge for something to be legal in the state: a few pieces of marijuana and to drink it.
One day in September, Mr. Orozco said that one day he and his friends were stopped when they were driving around the border near the Kansas border.
After the police found the marihua in the car, Mr. Orzoco took a call for small crime, carrying, and drug abuse.
"He was treated as a criminal," said Mr. Orzoco.
But is that someone?
For Colorado's entertainment use, it depends on hundreds of small amounts of minor drug laws in the late weeks of the year.
Hundreds of light criminals are already closed in Washington, approved by a similar cure.
When police officers were 21 and older adults entered the law in the following weeks, they stopped to blame for the small scale to be approved.
The prosecutors in Colorado, however, have vowed to keep existing Mauriah cases in a proper manner, and are still calling people to the court for carrying them.
At the same time, several cities from the Denver banks have been using the vote to prevent the arrival of the new state from opening in the areas of the Mayhua stores.
Daniel J. Oates, police chief Daniel J. Oates, at Delver's birth, said, "I don't know what's going to happen soon."
The editors in the Washington State are also getting their heads.
And on December 1, 2013, they're looking to direct the system of licensing and selling.
Colorado's first medical use, or that's what they say now is in front of most of the state about how to organize marijuana in entertainment.
"The Colorado has a more stable market, so they will be a good guide."
But no place or system has continued to do more than suggest what it's gonna work.
We have no real example.
Washington's I-502 name will be entered on December 6, and the state license will not exist yet, but will leave a certain year to carry law.
There are hard mechanism questions that should be resolved during this time, like how the state's schools, parks, childcare centres, or child care centres will be able to apply the term "technology" to the ligandian.
It is Ben Livingston, the New Development Group, who said, "No matter how hard it is to be able to maintain licensed, especially the Great City area."
On November 21, the chief Oates sent an e-mail to the authorities of the city, 21 and 20 years old, the officer of the city, who told the police that he would not sue for the crime.
Chief Oates said the police will put laws on the city where the medical marihua grew, and they'll follow the drug trade and traders again.
The area manager Ken Buck is representing another major discussion in the North Colorado region.
After the vote, he said that his office will continue to keep track of the case of moving to marijuana as a way of treating many users.
At present, 119 are accused of carrying two cones or less mariana against other charges.
"Our office has a responsibility to sue the crimes committed in the case of the crime in which our office lives," said Mr. Buck.
Even in places where the votes refused to enter marijuana, they were confused.
The cops in the largest city of the district are no longer responsible for the small amount of adults.
The district commander Pete Hautzinger has supported this decision, but he decided not to close his move cases.
He said, "I don't think I'm wasting my time to keep applying the law until it's done."
Although 55% of the voters in Colorado would never be easy to bring into the government and legal system.
And, of course, there's a difference between local officials about the great green experience of the state.
According to the Canadian lawyer and Marihuana National Institute of Laws, Sean McAllister said that it was a "culture bartender" in the area.
"They've spent so much of their lives in court so they still don't accept that it's legal," he said.
They are ready to have national tests to facilitate the abuse of drugs, as a small amount of marijuana, as the first state of the Mayado and Washington.
Governments and government officials are also expected to be taken from the federal government who plan for a new border for legal sales.
The lawsuitary marihuana lawyers expect the Justice Department to be taken back.
Despite the high profile of medical marijuana patients and sales, the federal government has allowed the federal government to operate medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington, and the other 16 countries.
Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug agent in Obama, said that he would probably not have to punch the doors to capture a small drug bag, but it would probably not be possible to allow the entertainment shop for new laws to be established.
A few cities in Colorado don't expect the federal authorities to move.
Even before the election day, some local governments agreed to pay their debts for another year to be opened.
The city of Montrose in the west last week brought a 6-month law and was likely accepted next week.
"We don't want to give anyone license and bring it to a big federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, member of the city Council, Bob Nicholson.
Our area has been voted against change.
We're looking at the vote of the state against the vote.
There's a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: I'm out of Oxford because I'm a reporter.
Only today's students are being attacked by their views
I can't remember having a place at Oxford University.
And my older brother and my older brother, my dream in my dream, was found in a place where two of the modern wine reds of the world's most learned wine are free and free.
But I've collected my bags at Worcester College in two weeks to read history.
My father's been destroyed and he cried.
Friends came back to surprise.
The House's Standard Day has convinced me that my license friends are having sex in my room.
The writer A N Wilson heard I'd been leaving because I was forced to drink a broken cup.
The truth was less funny.
I ran away.
Yeah, I ran away, because I've been facing a system-based sales and fear.
It's not because I'm a little weird, or because I'm coming from private school.
For only one reason, I was judged and this was the back-up and barbarbarous, my father, my sister Woodrow Wyatt, Margaret Thacher, and I supported the Mubatans.
You can ask me why I opened this up.
In recent reports, the new generation-rate students suffer similar judgment.
In Oxford, the reporters were organized against the students, and so many more violent people, disabled people and ethnic groups, and the same rights.
Because of Corpus Christi College's third grade room (JCR) they claimed that they were already left alone, they felt that they were being attacked personally and unsatisfactory.
They want to create a copy at the university's college for free access.
The new BBC Twood document has not been able to help: the young, the young, the teacher's politics, and the right-hand reporters have shown strange and strange neo-Nazi.
The University of Oxford (OCA) saw Joe Cooke, former president of the U.S., walking with Rolls-Royce, with silver suit and silver pressure.
In other colleges, professional students say they're acting as "synthesis" for high education fees.
Luke Black said to the U.S. President of Nottingham, U.S. President of the United States, "There's a left wing in colleges."
"Before we met, people think we're like the Bullingdon Club."
Samuel Roberts, a historian at Corpus Christi for better protection, says that this kind of environment is not "raising," but Stephenie Cheriller, the president of the U.S. President of the U.A., says that JC.C. members of the U.A. have a break against the right people.
"It's a threat to the internship atmosphere and the members."
In the first few weeks in Oxford, I was the only one.
In September 1986, I was 18-year-old shy.
The hatred for the Guard Party was the hotest time.
The former student gave up votes to reject Margaret Thtcher's honor as a result of his degree of higher education.
This atmosphere was filled with fear of a Stalin.
During the first few days of the first few days of our first week, I experienced the pain of the future.
I would have seen the teachers make sure that their teachers are being ridiculed by the public students, and they'd enjoy it.
The manager was brought to the top panel of the State of education, which was divided into South Africa, and the government's constitutional rights.
The first was about me converting the French text to English in the 18th century and I wasn't ready to go back to English.
"Mrs. Wyatt, please turn the first paragraph," my teacher said Harry Pitt.
That's what I've got.
A little man who looks like a face-to-face pie, Pitt's mind is too fast.
"Thachers refuse to learn French or just stupid?"
The other high-class students were bitten.
My tears have hurt in my eyes.
"In the free time, if you're not too busy with socialization, I suggest you take basic French lessons," said the officer, Pitt.
I walked back to my room with a painful face.
I sat alone at the college dinner that night, and then I felt a little relief.
It was a second-class English student named James, who identified himself as a member of the U.S.
He said, "I know I'm nice."
I'm afraid that's what this is.
He's dealing with anyone who suspects he's in charge.
That's bad enough for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thitcher, so it'll be worse for you.
Most reporters behave like a first-class worker party.
Then at a local bar, I tried to do it cowardly.
I insisted I didn't join anything Mrs. Thcher said.
This proved a tactical failure.
He said, "You're a facilitator of a fascist pig."
You're dirty.
The other students held themselves.
I was wrong, I was dirty.
Someone said, "How does it make sex?"
They're beating each other, aren't they?
I felt that before the libertarians were not allowed, I felt that it would be something of sexuality.
Have I ever lived a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet only those with the same opinion when it was dark?
Would I go back to the worker party and force my natural tendencies?
Three years before me, he was lying like a prison and a lonely buffer.
The only open source in my college was Norman Stone.
He was also hated because he was both a reporter and a foreign politician and one of the textwriters.
He's been found there very little.
Because he was a small stone and a little stone from there, and Marksist was building up his date relationship.
In 1997, Ankara started professor at the University of Billkent in Turkey.
He told me, "You're not going to be happy in the world."
I went home from Oxford to my parents' home in London, and I became my big city friends and my family.
I told Dad I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
All political views were accepted during his own time.
He said, "But it's the best place in the world."
They don't do that, they won't be among my dreamers.
Even my Communist friends have always had perfect behavior.
It's starting to be clouded by the German eyes.
Give me a chance.
I'm sure it's a joke.
I'll break my heart if you split up.
My emotional weakness to visit London often weakened.
A friend of mine was arrested for pressure, and he rejected his faith.
I decided to do the same when another history teacher told me that I'm a "a real enemy" in the next week.
I admitted to "my parents had been washed by my brain" and told them "good idiots."
It's a short walk.
He's my father, who's in the seat of my Oxford career.
Then he wrote two corner lines each week.
My door was locked.
I was in there, and five minutes later the guys went after me.
I've prepared a chicken when they're gone, and I've got the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a pesticide.
But no one in 18-year-olds should be afraid of such threats and needles in any educational institution.
And yet more tragically, Oxford and 14 reporters are hiding behind a line of equality and freedom that he doesn't deserve and that he doesn't deserve.
He washed two people in Trabzon.
It's the two-year-old tree that has been effective in the Yomra District of Trabzon.
When the two women were missing in the stone village, the Savvan village was closed to my destination.
One of the two women missing were found.
The rain had been affected at 1500 on Yomra's high cut.
Two of them were underwaters of nearly 200 feet of water that tied the land to Sayvan Kööy.
Abraham Karsli said, "It has been closed for three hours, even though the authorities have allowed the authorities to report it.
We live the same thing every time we're in violent rain.
We announced to the authorities, but there's no way.
The citizens are getting down.
We've been through this trouble every year.
"The trees are falling off the river," he said.
WHEN CONFRONTING ANOTHER LOSS
Yomra Mayor Abraham Sacıroğlu, the mayor of the city, said that one of the two women who disappeared in the country was found to have a body of the dead, continued searching for another person.
It reminds us that the effects of a cure that has had on the country last night, that the two women gathered in the Tüsdel area were gone to the deep waters of deep water.
"The work of our mayor of our citizen's body is finally reached under the ground, trying to search for the other."
He added that the rain had lost its effect, that it had left the earth in the sun, and that the missing person had been able to look for the missing man and work on closed roads.
While the missing women were working on their search, the village was announced to reach its destination.
>>uzb_Latn<< "Structch the T-shirt"
Trabzon's village in Yomland, Yomland, Yomland, Turkey, attempts to cure the wounds of the sick and the sick.
He said, "It's not as bad as raining for about three hours, but it's not rain."
"We've stopped collecting a lot of people's homes during the rain.
And then there came to be such a disaster.
The lost bride and rock were collecting flank during the rain.
Then they were caught in the monastery while they went back home.
He added that the electricity was cut in the villages and that the waters were not flowing.
Hassan Selim was 60 years old, pointing out that he didn't see a rain like that, "If rain would continue for another hour, there would be no stone around here."

First of all, I'd like to take off the property file that gives the public a lot of sound.
We're going to take a look at these books that will continue in writing.
You can find answers to all the questions on the main lines of our writing.
You can send your answer to the@hip.com.tt.
I'm going to be in a really tough place to answer you as soon as possible.
What's your financial retirement?
MALLIEL's age of retirement has been able to reduce the workout at least 60 percent of the working hours and reduces the SGK and Bag-Kur's insurance conditions to prevent the lives of the SeGK-Kur.
In the case of public employees, they may have lost their ability to perform their duties as separate from those mentioned above, and they are still likely to be retired.
Who's worth the money?
I'm writing from Diyabkarr, my name is Mehme Gülün, I have 920 days insurance, and I also have 1460 days of military loans.
Besides, I'm a kidney disease.
I'm connected to the diabetic machine.
I'm still working at a job.
Can I get a monetary month?
- Merymet Bey's past first.
You didn't tell me when you first told me you were going to work for the first time in your problem.
But let's tell you a little bit about how wealth will be tied to the moon.
First of all, the most important thing in the law is that it has been insurance for 10 years and is your gathering day for 1800 days.
In addition, when you lose 60 percent of your power of working strength, or your job failure, or your job disease, you have lost at least 60 percent of the strength you lose.
However, you're able to cure 60% of your dietary disease here because you don't have to fill the 1800 prim days.
Of course, we don't know how long you've been working.
The 10th day you have completed together, and the day after you have completed it, you will be on the basis of your decision.
Opportunities for wealth exchange
No one's been retired for 10 years, no one's been retired for 1800 days?
- 1800 days of prim pay must be completed.
But only one thing is that it connects the amount of income of ten years of insurance that is required for someone else's constant care.
In the final section of our writing about those who are sick or sick, those who are in constant need of health care will be satisfied.
It's the case of those who are wealthy before they start working
I'm Ahmet Powers.
Since I'm carrying all the conditions in the SGK law, they told me that you can't afford to pay for the first time because I'm sick for the first time.
I'm so famous.
It's not fair.
How am I retired?
Ahmet Bey, you have written that you have made all the conditions in the Law, but one of the main circumstances and the loss of the loss of SSK and Bag-kour insurances in the law is required before you start working for the loss of illness.
It can't be tied to wealth because you don't carry this water.
However, you may be retired when you carry out your retirement conditions when the age insurance is closed.
- I have 3980 days, and I've been in insurance for 16 years.
It was discovered by the SGK before my monastery went into work.
They told me you couldn't be retired.
In this case, what do I do?
I won't be retired.
Could you show me the way?
- Yes, you heard the truth.
You can't be retired.
But in the SGK law, there's also a retirement prescription.
So, before October 2008, and after that, there are two things.
For the first time you start working before this date, if you find out that you're available for at least 15 years before you're working, you're able to have a limited age of approximately 3600 prim days.
So we suggest that you are required to apply to a near SGK director for a month.
Well, if you were to get into business after 2008, then you could have received an age of age as a year of insurance for at least 10 years and at least 3960 days of age, old age, age insurance, and death insurance.
Is it supposed to leave the job when I apply?
I'm still working as a driver at a job.
When I went to the hospital, he found me cancer.
I want to be retired.
Do I have to leave your employer in this case?
Can't I apply for wealth without being separated?
I don't want to be unemployed until we're stuck.
- You heard right.
You're supposed to have to leave the job so that you can keep the moon bond.
However, before applying for the month, you need to be paid according to the SGK law.
But if you make up for the sacred month, then it is lawful for you to pay the whole month.
It doesn't mean you're willing to make a request for a month's imprisonment, you have no chance to be unsatisfactory.
That's enough for you to have 1800 days.
If you go to SGK to find my property, then SGK will love one of your mature hospitals.
And when you're brought to SGK, where you're going, the SGK will be considered in the SGK system, and if your cancer is affected by your loss of work, you will be required to apply for a monthly application.
However, if you need to fill up 10-year insurance period for your month, it can be a month.
So we can say that it's not wise to apply the SGK health firm's decision to make the SGK medical decision.
But if the insurance that does not work, the SGK can also ask the SGK to determine the location of the property and the relationship of the monthly.
If it's property and other conditions, it could be useful for the early month starter.
Is the Bag-Kur debt worth the cost?
I'm a Bag-Kur insurance.
I carry all the conditions.
But they said you can't be retired because I owe you.
What should I do?
- I'll read it valuable.
Whoever told you, he was telling the truth.
You don't write what other terms are, but if you think you're carrying these conditions, you're still under obligation to pay 4/b prim.
But I can give you a special tiyo.
I suggest you pay your debt to pay off banks or similar equipment so that you can connect.
As soon as it's connected, it'll take so much months and you'll pay for your debt a minute.
These institutions will be easy to pay for what they did for your month.
What status does the Malability month have?
And I worked as the SSK and Bag-Kur and the Embassy Sandi.
When I deserve a month, where will it be for me?
If you work more than one stadium, Bag-Kurlu, SSK, and the officer, the last time you're working as a insurance, you're tied to the final insurance, and you're going to get out of SSK.
SGK reports are also valid
How is Malfic advice being applied?
What hospital can I get a health report?
It's enough for you to apply to the social security firms or social security centers that you are connected to health reports.
SGK will love you for military hospitals based on health care and research clinics (as well as college colleges), Turkish armed forces.
However, in the year that these hospitals do not exist, it can also be done by the Department of Health.
Isn't it possible to love a private hospital?
- There's only conditions.
In the old construction, only the state physicians are able to maintain a patient's love and life, with a new rule that would lead to the hospital, with a new rule in which he was able to take care of SGK.2013, and would be able to provide special treatment for another patient.
What are the conditions for love work?
It is enough that there is a 1800 days of primin to ensure that the supply of insurance found in the SEVK demand.
It'll pay the hospital fees for the presence of Malability.
And 10 years of insurance will not be called.
In the case of Malability, if the person has a limited amount of material, he is connected only to the 1800 days of insurance, without the search for a 10-year insurance period of insurance.
So when a person first arrives to detect his wealth for the first time, the SGK is just looking at the cost of the amount he could afford.
>>uzb_Latn<< The Nargile Operation
Nargile started in prison for laws that had not been applied to cafes.
The results of the weekend have to stop the production of many operating expenses.
In addition, the operation began with the warning that the intanbul had entered the cafes.
With the operation of non-substituted actions in the five-year-olds in the five-century region, there was stopped.
With almost all the narcotic cafes being controlled, the first pay will be reduced to the employees who continue to engage in the drug marketing.
And the rest of the business will be shut down by seal.

It was published by the Department of Justice and Alcohol Research (TATPDK) in the same month as the United States Department of Human Health.
It has been announced that two months from school to at least 200 feet [200 m] away from schools.
It's also forbidden to drink drugs in closed places.
It started with Bekiktash on the first day of the first operation that didn't fit in the wire.
Al Faker, who has the most popular leaders of Istanbul, had to stop selling many non-profit trades in Ikram Nargile Cafe and Behe, in the Ikram Kafe in the Iklam Kafe in the Battle of Bihmur.
Responsibilities start 23
In the end, there will be punishments that begin with 230,000 TTLs.
There'll be plenty of money worth three times, and we'll be sealed.
According to claims, in Istanbul, nearly five employees have a cafe spirit.
warning to bottles
According to TAPDK, on July 27, workers were forced to take their drugs into their "supervised" bottles of health messages, either by removing or by changing the amount of information provided by the Ministry of Health.
Warnings are being applied to the development of bottles from the mouth section.
For the press of health warnings, the blue, red, yellow, and black can be used.
There's a lot of warnings about the cafe at the moment.
Critical warning to families of duty
The General General's advice is to warn family members about the activities that are set out in order to be separate from illegal organizations.
The territorial Council of Territorial Directorship has discovered a new plan of co-operation between the DHKP-C, MLP, TKP, TKIP, and some of the collaborations of the territorial teams in 17 years.
The security forces that determine the "supervised campaign" for young people to gather themselves on the side of the terrorist organization, warning their families not to be sent to these camps.
The terrorist police who discovered that the terrorist organisations were planning to organize 41 camps in different years, wanted their families not to send their children to these camps.
350 families stopped sending their kids into camp.
The terrorists, particularly the terrorists, who, like DHKP-C and TKIP, were particularly involved in the efforts of terrorist organizations to win youths in the organization, have been influenced by the effects of the campaign.
The 300 families who took their warning to pay attention to their children's talk camps.
Following the warnings of the police, 41 camps were cancelled from 14 camps.
The terrorist organisations performed 20 camps against the increase of participation.
The security forces continue by 2 camps, and 5 camps are planned to be maintained in the future.
He also sent a warning message about these camps for all the years.
Young People are being deceived
It was discovered that the terrorists had been adopted by 20 camps, Kocaeli, Kocaeli, Fisher, Nihüdde, Burdüd, Burtun, Burtsun, Artwin, Mersin, and Hayi, and Samsun, Samsun, Tragon, Barzon, Barmir, Hammir, and Adana.
According to the International Reports, these camps often participate in colleges.
Unscrupulous organisations win young people by traping their proponents in camp.
In these camps, young people who have joined in the organization are also growing up in the organization’s organization.
In these camps under a summer camp, the organization's education has been given education, and there is a theory of how actions can be transformed into violence.
A message that comes back after half-wheel.
About 50 years ago by a boy named Dennis Komsa, a poem that was thrown to Atlantic Oceanu, found the owner of the United States in New Jersey.
Cam bottle came out of the enzyme in the United States after the year that we've passed into the United States.
In the bottle, "I think you can answer the following questions and send them to the address below.
This is a scientific research published by Dennis Komsa (12).
In writing, the person who found the bottle is asked where, where, when and how he found it.
There's also a lot of money to pay for a envelope and a post office fee.
On August 16, 1963, springtimes were held on the island of New Jersey, about 35 miles [30 km] from the coast of New Jersey.
In 1963, Komsa, 12-year-old, explained that it was a surprise to see the bottle he threw into the ocean, and I was thinking that someone would find it, but I didn't think the bottle would come back to me.
The sound frequencies fall in love
Turkey's first sound engineer told me what it could do with Sanden Pamir sound frequencies, I was surprised.
When you say sound technology or sound engineering, everybody's got sound systems on the mind of music.
Did you know that sound technology can prevent terrorism from happening, that you could be able to make a perfect murder that you want to love someone you want, you could make a secret confession of yourself, or the world's rhythm?
The SAE college at the University of Bankent, University of Bincet, gained its voice engineering diploma from the SAE College in England, and mastered the voice technology at the Midlessex University.
The connection to the Beyovoyl Galasaray is growing up in ICT Music Academy, and music technology, audio technology, performance technology, electronic music, and future records.
Anti-Syname message
"What kind of sound technology is exactly the first question?"
"It's a technology used in many areas around the world.
All our brains are covered with electrical currents.
The sound frequency is some kind of electric current, energy.
Using this energy, you can change people's consciousness, make them act with the command you want."
One of the most important wave of sound technology is subliminal message.
In the music or song, it's placed a message in a given frequency outside of the human mind, but it's not known by the top mark, but it's going to the table.
For example, according to Pamir's report that when a terrorist attack was reported, it was reported to be a music broadcast in that area.
If there's a message like "Don't do this attack" in the terrorist alphabet, it will notice this message.
He doesn't know what it's like to hear, but the substrate's detecting it and the voice of a voice says to him, "ma."
No mention is made of him.
But in the world and Turkey, such messages are absolutely legal and law.
It's just a five-year-old embassy message for students at a conference held at the University of Istanbul.
"I've heard a music during the conference.
I've put a voice in the music called 'Suu'.
At the end of my presentation, I asked the students if they couldn't shut up.
"They all say they're all very thirsty," he says.
Pamir said, "There are some people who use subliminal messages in our hearts that have been identified by some radio channels but details are not yet known.
In Germany, there's a channel called "Kara Sound Radiosu", a frequency of radical Islamicists.
It sends messages that have been attacked by the subsynonymous, religious, and drug use.
The German police also know that Turkish police know it, but they can't start for changing frequency."
And in the music world, it's also used dangerous messages.
Especially in songs of some heavy metal bands...
According to these claims, there were no terrorists in the towers, and the attack was performed with subliminal commands that the victims were able to detect.
Secret table
Sound technology can also be used in crime situations.
In the United States, especially bank robbery, it's from science.
For example, when the police get into their phone contact with the police driver, the sound engineers can determine where the phone is on the phone, where the person is in the banking room.
It's different when one sound hits a metal, stone, plastic, wall, or anything else.
It's also possible to identify the size of the room, even the shape of the room.
Thus, the voice of the guilty can determine which items are found in the room, in which size and shape they are found.
And there's a computer program used for this program, which has even made the drawings of a opera building from Tatarina, "If 175 fans are placed into the building, I've calculated the perfect sound structure.
It's not a expensive technology, it's worth 4-50,000 dollars."
The sound frequency is also used in architecture and assembly.
Pamir has a lot of work to do about it.
For example, a restaurant where business men were gone, the top-level meeting was held, and the sound was not coming out of the table.
They can only hear what they're talking at the table.
Two steps ahead of you can't hear anything that's spoken on the table.
The general system of such structures says, "If you want to destroy one voice, you hit it with another sound of its molecular structure, and you turn the current sound energy into heat.
If it wasn't the system, no one would be on the plane.
Because the sound of the flight engines is too high to endure.
In the plane, these sounds destroy themselves by striking each other.
Even if your windows are open with this system, you can create a remote environment from your home. ”
Is the Egyptian pyramid being made with voice?
There are other interesting things Pamir's first sound engineers do.
For example, he made an open air disk on the Moon that could not be heard out of his voice.
The sound can't go beyond the border, compared to another sound frequency.
Even within a specific line, he can make it quiet.
Pamir also brought a sports room for sports and concert.
So it's double use.
Because there's a need for fuel when playing basketball, but it doesn't have to be burned in the concerts.
There's only one sound quality of music that can be heard in open conferences.
"We're using the frequencys that make the sound that is being heard as noises and corrects the human consciousness and improves the music's mind.
MTV's too far ahead of it.
He's holding open conferences, and he's being heard as a studio record in the sound field."
That's what Tubitak's experience was.
The sound frequency separates two albums from each other.
There were scientists who claimed that Egyptian pyramids were sounding.
They think the stones could be raised up with sound.
I'm just saying, "Is that easy to use with bad intentions?"
"When I read the University of New York online, I was afraid, or if others read it."
Because even those who are well-informed can cause terrible consequences if they are said to be outside the lab conditions."
"Duar is effective with Arabic."
And Seden Pamir, who says that the noise will affect the person in a positive way, explains why: "The sound of the ear is conveyed to the brain.
But the person hears the sound that he's alone, but the other voices give his brain a message, actually, and he's getting tired.
It's good to get rid of your brain, so walking naked on the ground is good for walking around.
I think schools should be organized for the order of silence in schools.
So the student will be able to concentrate on the voice of the teacher alone and provide a longer concentration."
Pamir, who believes that prayers will be effective in the Arabic language, says that Arabic has a lot of rich frequency when the words come close to him.
"But I'm gonna have to read the prayers aloud, and I'll be nervous when I read the syrup."
[ Picture on page 12] Fraese and Love
"Is it possible to fall in love with a person's sound frequency?"
Don't fall in love with pamir, and in the truth, the frequency of the person's feelings is, "You should find the frequency of the pressure used when you talk to someone you want to love.
You can influence it by using a higher frequency than this frequency.
For example, let's imagine that there are 300 of the men's pressure frequency.
And you want to play a music with her.
If you're going to play the music you're going to have to cut off the power of only those of the frequency on the 300 frequency of the music, you'll get the power to double pressure, the power of that person's ability to control.
Maybe she could fall in love with someone who's in front of her.
Pamir, who says that there are special sound systems in the world that can be more effective in speaking, says that the press sounds are very powerful, a stage artist can feel like a natural existence.
"Now, it's trying to make a sound that is going to be heard by Mikail in Japan, how do you think this is going to sound like this? "I think it's very close to the human voice because it sounds very close to the human voice.
What a wonderful device, for example, is made from the human body."
'The prices of gold will rise.'
Canadian Jennings Capital Inc.'s Department of Agency Dan Hrushawsky said that the government will continue to increase the amount of money, so that the gold prices will continue to function as a safe and secure organization."
According to Hrushewsky, who was in the first half of the last week's investment vehicle under the rate of global demand, it seemed to be supported by investors in the prices, China and India, saying, "The 6 percent of the investors in China have been supporting the prices, and it has been said that it is a high-speed investment."
I believe that India's traditional gold buyer, Hrushewsky, "I believe that by reducing the gold charge of the government, I have no doubt that you don't see it anymore.
People used to find a way in this frame."
Hewsky, on the other hand, suggested to investors under a long period of investment, "It will continue to serve as a safe design engine.
A lot of West government has been forgotten from the lack of "disciplinary limitations."
Governments work hard to reduce the cost of money units.
That's why gold prices will rise above current levels.
"The promise of gold, the ability to reduce the price of market risks"
The World Council of Golden, Marcus Gubb, said that the six-year-old financial markets are more complicated and reliable, and said, "If the value and safety of gold is lower than gold, it will reduce the risk of growth and loss of market prices.
The gold portfolios produced from small amounts of gold proved to be more effective than the growth of the evidence, often being more stable and more stable in marketing disorders."
"On the last 10 years of the gold investment demand, it represents less than 1 percent of the global economy.
This means your market opportunities are still important to grow in gold investment.
According to this newspaper, 78 percent of the population's ashes of gold and skeletals, under the bottom of the investor's interest," he said.
>>uzb_Latn<< "Hindia should increase the national gold standards to support economic growth."
The world's largest gold market, which answers to India and China's questions, Gubb, said in the second half of the gold prices, the demand for gold, silver, and the country's land industry increased its investment in Asia.
The group reminded China that 54 percent of the jewelry demand in China was 51 percent in India.
"In the second half of the Chinese consumers, if they were able to buy gold from low prices, they were able to sell it to a high-power train, they would be quiet.
After the death of gold prices in Russia, the demand has been increased and the sandstones are running rapidly."
In India, the government has taken a lot of measures to support the loss of the Indian Central Bank and reduce the status of the government's government, saying, "It is difficult for the government to manage and reduce government progress, and this is why it is difficult to communicate with the underlying demand.
The World Golden Council believes that India's policy needs to see gold as an economic investment.
Additionally, long-term political goals have been found to increase national gold standards to support economic growth.
Trends of Turkish Golden Trench
According to the report of the World Golden Convention last week, global gold demand was 856,3 tons of gold and gold in the second half of the year.
In the second quarter of the year, a significant increase in the number of countries, according to the same period of the year, increased in 54% in China, 51 percent in India, and 33 percent in Turkey.
During the time of the war, the demand for tobacco in China continued to grow stronger, and the prices increased to 87%, according to the same summer of the year, and finally reached 276 tons in this year.
In India, the government's plan to increase tax tax rates in the first quarter of the gold charge was raised by 71 tons per year.
A hot blackening movie: Tepen's children
Doctor at Trabzon...
The players of the film are beautiful, loving, handsome, strong-wheeled, strong-wheeled people.
Free in Love
There's only 400,000 copies of a film with a budget, a lot of food, and a joke.
"We'd like to watch a real blackening story of a real Blackenzy in the early 1980s of the Syname Love".
The film of "Tepenn Waklers" in Akchababat's Chickenkalk, and all of the amateur players, has made fun of the film in 1980.
Forum AVM was very interested in the release mechanisms of press in the Cinemaximumines.
The band that lived in a very large city night, with the horons, made a wonderful night with the Blackenzy.
At the beginning of Galala, Prime Minister Muhare and Chief Minister Muhammet Balta, Trabzon Minister Dr.Orhan Füzi Güğlulu, Ol Embassy, and Turzı Kütıl Kütımıl and Turzığılılı Kashai Kayan Kayan Kayan, and a large member of the People's People's People's Republic.
In the film Dr. Eysmet Erayn, the director of the Golden Karahsank, Aishaquağ, Kalk, Salk, Selaittsak, Kamrays, and Vayde Erayn.
Today 61 copies were used by Turkish for the first time in Turkey to understand the Black Seadenic culture so that Tepenn would be better understood in the 1980s.
The star shining on the hill!
Samet Blacksanan is just 18 years old.
You're watching the best thing you can do about the name of the Sadabzon who lives in Trabzon.
The actor of an amateur theater history is successful at the top of the comedy and the dramas.
The Satt Carahsanogu, who deserved to end their purchases, opened the term "one of the next players to come."
Comedy and Drama together!
In Trabzon's Chicken River, 12 September 1980, is the subject of the film that describes what happened in a period of time:
"Filmin's primary character is young Hikmet's father working in Germany.
One of the biggest dreams of Hykmet, who continues to be a shepherd in winter months, is to become a doctor.
It's not too much to read and work.
But when a country's rich family is given love to Züleyha, it's hard to do.
This love, which he has kept for years, is the father of Zukleyha, who decides to tell his friends what he's got from his friends.
Sabri Aqua has other plans for her daughter.
He was also one of the greatest of the families of the surrounding villages, and he came to war against the inhabitants of the hill."
Long distance from the short movie...
The stage was the senator and director of the Gaada film, and Dr. Itmet Erayn took a very small budget of Tepenn's Whistlers, who said,
"When we started this movie, our goal was to make a short film.
But the first shots were so much interesting in social media that we began to get excited about making a long metraj.
When we went to Istanbul, they said, "Do you have a good game?"
And I said, "We don't have anything, but I have 86 blackened players anywhere."
The film and the series that's been built by today has been used very bad tastes, and the blackener has identified the wrong person.
You're gonna watch 86 original blackden people in the movie you'll watch.
I tried to take a blackener.
I wish if others were to take a shot before me, we'd be watching a crazy comedy movie.
If the black man wasn't telling the truth, I wouldn't have taken this movie.
You know, we first put a Turkish note on the movie.
That'll be the first.
We did this to make our black hair better.
We've also put the sixts in the film that turned the English speech scene into the Blackenzy.
When we turned the camera into a camera while we were filming, the player was out.
We're our first movie on the hill.
"My mistakes, I may be missing."
Don't miss this

In Turkey, the amount of smoking in the first six months of this year, 10 percent of the same year, has been reduced to 479 million per cent of the same year.
According to the National Institute of Education and Alcohol Research (TAPDK), Turkey has been fully funded by the National Institute of Education for Children's use in education and by the National Institute of Education (TAPDK).
According to research, Turkey's population in 15 and 16 million (16 million people) were used every day or time every day in 2008, and in 2012 it fell to 27,141 million people (14.8 million people) in that rate and reduced the amount of tobacco use.
4% of men use 13 per cent of 131 per cent of women
The population of people who use tobacco products is 47,9% of men, and women are less than 15.2 percent.
According to research, 10 of the people who use tobacco are planning to quit smoking.
The population of those who thought to leave the plant in a month was 12.9, 12 months later, the rate of those who planned to leave in the land was 35.44.
In the study section, it was given to these views:
"In Turkey, the use of tobacco laws and the U.S. National Institute of Development and the Action Plan is defined as an effect on the development of the United Kingdom.
As a result, the number of tobacco consumptions increased by 2 million from 2008 to 4.1 per cent of the use of cigarettes increased by 4.1 per cent. The most significant decrease in price rates, such as young adults and less educated people.

One more innovation to Android!
He'll take this patent with the Google patent and make it easier.
Google, who's the first person between mobile operating systems, has taken a patent of a new interface technology to share files with his friends.
It's a function that contributes to the sharing of wireless technologies such as NFC and Bluetooth, in fact, not very different from Androd Beam and Apple Airdrop.
The last new innovation that Google signed is that this operation is only one time-consuming sharing, and it's a way to give users the easy way to go.
And if the new property is to take place in the Androde...
Here's Turkey's first local smart phone.
Turccell went into the smart phone.
It's going to be in Turkey for smart phones to be made with China.
His name is T40
Turccell introduced Turkey's first local smart phone.
The TCEL design is designed in Turkey and will provide the smart phone with China in Turkey at the end of September.
Turccell, director of Turkey Cyliv, said that the U.S. chip maker of the U.S. has been developing the United States and planned to sell the smart phone T40 as the Gebze project in February nine countries.
Ciliv, a member of T40's talk with Turkish producers, said, "It's in China; it's starting to be in Turkey before 2013."
THE FIGURATIVE HEART
Ciciv, who said they would offer the phone for a reasonable price, explained that they would be able to sell the price.
Civ said that using a smart phone with more efficiently than the use of the device sales with T40 would be more effective than marketing.
Ciliv, who claimed Turccell's sales were sold from the T series of phones from 2010, reported that these sales brought about 500 million liras.
>>uzb_Latn<< FIVE PRIVATION OF FRIENDS.
Turkey Cilv said that T40 would have features like high-level voice, sound, voice, and configured user interface.
Civ said T40's price will be explained before the telephone is off the market, and the phone will be the best.
HERILL 5 MIRARD DRIENDS
"3% of the phones that come to Turkey in 57% of the phone calls were smart phone calls.
The average cost of the phones sold by the increase of this area came up to $300.
We're paying a $5 billion a year each year, and my concern is that it will increase."
The T40, Qualcomm double pair processor and 1 GB RAM feature will be working on the Android operating system.
They're all sympathy!
The records of students who are in the normal middle of school were updated as an emip and middle school
MEB, after 4+4 edits in education, all my primary school schools in Turkey were adopted as elementary, middle school, and immaterial.
Following the 1-year period period, it was discovered that a number of school immaterials had signed a new scandal during the conversion process.
It came to my day during the process of re-engineing and re-indulating records of all school students who could take care of this year's em and attend the middle school in Turkey this year.
>>uzb_Latn<< 1 year normal middle school
Sherker's High School, 4+4+4, was replaced by the middle school last year.
In school, the system was conducted together with students of three and four classes and eightth grade students.
The school, who served as a regular middle school for 1 years, was transferred to the age of 2012-2013 teaching year by the end of the year.
The school, which I read, first time this year, adopted the 5th grade students as a "memphatist student" at school.
However, last year, the students who are in the middle of the 5th grade and who attend the 6th grade this year were automatically adopted as an empathetic student.
"The other school that doesn't like
The citizens who learned about the situation were complaining about the situation at school.
However, the school board said to the citizens from the national education department, "The citizens who don't want their children to continue the embassy, can take their record in another middle school."
In explaining the report of the Council of Elijah National Education, there were interesting expressions.
"We've re-enacted some schools from the Council of Conya Valley, which is a 15-20 school letter in Konya.
Schools are entering school codes in the Department's Department's e-cultural system.
But when the school is turned off, the old school's code is removed from the system.
The new school code needs to be recorded by students in the system.
Those schools also sent students and teachers to write letters and middle school, so that the same type of school was changed.
The citizens who want their children can take their children from these schools and give them to other schools."
