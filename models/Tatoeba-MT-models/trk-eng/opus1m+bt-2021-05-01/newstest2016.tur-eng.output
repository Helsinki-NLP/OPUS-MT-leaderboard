Professor 911 announced he killed his girlfriend by calling her 911
The University Professor Shannon Lamb, who was looking for 911, said that the police had shot his girlfriend with a gun, and the police only said that the police had to come home.
Lamb said the "servative dog" is alive and probably sad and the household of the woman's family can be found on the cell phone.
The cops found a note written by Amy Prentiss in the house and a letter written by a white note, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I love Amy, and she's the only woman who's read me to me."
The Mississippi found no evidence that Lamb's successful history professor at Delita State University in Cleveland had taken over 300 miles in front of his office by Ethan Smidt, who thought he was killed by Ethan Smidt's office.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said he was shot at 10:18.
Lamb's call was 911, and he said he did it shortly after that.
At the end of the day, after another death, Lamb committed suicide when the police came near him.
Once the students and professors were allowed to hide behind the lock doors, the authorities were still searching for what Lamb was still trying to do this.
And both of the state's investigations have included the details that students and staff have learned about him, but probably a problem teacher.
The students said they were looking forward to getting into his class.
A police officer at Prince's death in Gautier said that Lamb was not found.
Schmidt even said he was one of the people who shared academic life from Lamb in his book.
Both of them were taught at the Social Sciences and History Division, and many students have studied both of them.
Still, there were signs of spiritual problems.
Well, Brandon Beavers said that he was also worried and worried about what happened.
Another student Mikel Sykes said that Lamb had been under stress during the 2014 /15 study year.
Lamb said there were some health problems before, he asked the University of Delta State.
He was just teaching two from the internet this year.
The university's recent changes in business policies were impossible to guarantee that Lamb was a complete student, despite his long-term efforts to win.
He said that there was a problem between William LaForge, Lamb and Schmidt, but he said, "There are some things in your mind."
These are questions that Lamb can't answer anymore.
After the campus was released, the police took off the road to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Washington County Adulty Research director Metheel Johnson explained that his family had committed suicide before entering a home in Mississippi, a home in Greenville's bank nearly 38 miles away.
Lamb's car was found on the highway.
Although Lamb didn't determine why he was leaving this house immediately, Johnson said he believed that Lamb knew those living in this house.
Lamb grew up in this area.
Lab began working at the 35,000 college in the city of 35,000 in 2009, and gave birth to geography and education.
He took his doctor in the first spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as intelligent, complicated, and fun.
When Carla Hairston met with his partner friends, he said he was 15, Lamb's 20 years old.
Carla and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a very nice person who tried to play guitar for a few years.
He was a man who threw the hearts fast.
Hairston, who is now 40 years old and living in Jackson's banking hall, said, "When he came, all the girls were coming."
Lamb and Prentis were obviously together for a while.
On 911, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there's no official record of their marriage.
In Gautier's house, there were dozens of dogs living with them in Light's name.
The police said the dog was fine.
Princes' ex-husband Shawn O'Steen said they were divorced 15 years ago, but Prentices and now has 19 girls.
O'Steen also said that her daughter was completely ruined.
He and his mother were great friends.
He said he never met O'Steen Lab, but she heard that she was interested in the music from Abigail and stole the tapes.
Lamb and Prentiss met when Lamb and Abigail went to the stage three years ago at a summer festival.
Then Lamb and Abigail stole it in general shows.
O'Steen said she wrote her music itself and said it.
Prentices was a nurse working in various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, who is a member of the Gautier near the Gautier, and sometimes a host of entertainment coordinators, has seen Lamb and Prentiss at least five days after he has finished playing.
There was no sign of the problem.
He said they're such a happy couple.
Sometimes we cut off and we were selling each other a deal.
They both had a wonderful sense of humor.
Don Allen Mitchell, an English professor at the same university, explained that the murder Professor Schmidt was a expert on the first-class seminar program, and the Americans and colonial history.
He was married, and he had three young children.
He was graduated from Emporia State University in Kansas, and was also the president of a student that he established.
On Tuesday night, nearly 900 people in the Delta State University of Cleveland joined the campaign of academics, college workers, students and local visitors.
At the time of the university's "Parlak morning Star" and "Murday Zarafe" songs, Schmidt's wife, Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt, joined his brother Jeff Schmidt.
The class continues on Wednesday.
"We're trying to bring our light back."
The crisis's over.
It's time for the wounds.
Amy and Rosie Solis reported on Cleveland, Mississippi.
>>uzb_Latn<< Associated Press writers Emily Barster Pettus (Greenville, Mississippi) and Rebecca Santana (New Orleans).
This message was corrected in a way that the police called the 911 after the death of Lamb and told Lamb that he was called "head" at 911, even though after he said that he was married to Princes at 911.

Michael J. Fox made Esperlers in the Council of Princes Diana
It's a very important vow for Michael J. Fox.
It was very important for personal reasons.
He said in the documentary Back in the new era of Time: "We waited for the members of the royal family who sat in the seminar room and suddenly realized that the seat was empty, and I was sitting next to me and sitting next to the Prince Diana.
The film began, and I realized that your date with the Galler Prince was a false attempt and a arm walk away.
A documentary documentary about "be return to the future" includes comments made by Robert Zemeckis and the director of Robert Zemeeckis and his director Steven Spielberg.
For the first time to return to the future, he was in a virus 30 years ago.

>>uzb_Latn<< UN Chief Says There Is No Military Solulation in Syria
Concerning Russia's return to Syria, General Secreter Ban Ki-moon said that about five years of age, the problem of Syria will be more violent and more violent for millions of people.
The UN General Council also invited all sides to find a political solution, including the UN Security Council.
Ban announced that five permanent concert members of the United Nations Assembly meeting will meet at the end of Wednesday, China, Russia, England, and France.
He said that the division between members of the Council and the Syrian people has great sorrow about the local powers "to be able to solve it."
Ban invited five permanent members to join him in the Syria crisis, as he was in Iran nuclear agreement.
Donald Trump's 8th Annette Race showing that he's serious.
Some have tried to label him as a burner.
Others asked him like he was a joke.
And some are supporting the internal explosion.
Although some of the Republicans tried to get Donald Trump down on the streets, it did not work.
The last 11 national embassy of the last 11 national ant showed him the leadership of Donald Trump, and some start to ask if he's a chance to be a legal leader.
Of course, it's early in the election cycle.
None of this doesn't mean Trump could win the race race of the Republics.
In 2011, the investors claimed that Rick Perry's rise was also due to the growth of Herman Cain, and both failed to win the tax process in one state.
And in general, there are many reasons why you're going to have trouble.
But, like Jeb Bush's Super PAC band and the economic conflict group, these foreign groups are going to realize the importance of Trump's permanent power to destroy it.
There are some brief consequences that indicate that the emperor's only presence is not temporary:
Trump's choice has changed 180 degrees.
Donald Trump recently declared that he had a positive view of the ten members of the ten members of the United States for the Monmouth University in June.
It was 40 percent in the middle of July.
It was 52% in the early August.
Now six of the 10th members of the Republic have a positive opinion about Donald Trump.
Three of the three of them say they're positive.
And these numbers are seen in high places early.
The last week in Iowa, a ship in Quinniac, showed that 60 percent of the Republicans prefer Donald Trump.
Two of the GOP voters may be pleased with the Trump island.
They said that if 67 percent of the Republicans were on the CNN/ORC calendar last week, Trump's will be "sucked" or "attacked" or "attack."
Only 10 of them say they're going to fall down if he's a candidate.
It's only about 40 percent for Trump, when I say it's going to be the same level with Carson Trump.
The next person to love?
Only 21%, Marco Rubio.
On the other hand, 47 percent of the members of the Republic are said to be "no" or "mys."
Most of the Republics don't see Trump as a problem.
While Donald Trump was criticized for the use of visual language and criticisms, on Monday the United States News/ Washington Post Office, 52 percent of the members of the Republic believe that they have the right to be president of the Embasssy Government.
The same number exists in Iowa, according to Quininnpac, that last week, 52 percent of the Republicans believe that he will be the leader of the Republic.
He thinks he still has 44 percent to serve as an active member, and says that six of his crews are not compatible with the White House, according to the EUC/Phost.
The Republicans are starting to get used to this idea.
When they wear their political expert hats, the Republicans think Trump is serious.
According to a CNN/ORC update last week, when the best candidate was asked who the best candidate was to win the GOP Island, four of whom said that Trump was the best.
It's a change from the end of the July to the end of the month that four of them were sent to Jeb Bush.
Full expression: In the past, the GOP voters weren't very clear.
During the last election, four of the members of the Republic thought that Rick Perry would be a candidate, and only 28 percent of the treaty was selected.
It's still seen that the majority of GOP voters found Trump's election campaign.
Even if the Republicans are gathered around another island, Trump's still renewing everyone.
Some experts point out that Trump's stand on the front line, and that Trump's support is the fact that it is about one dozen islands between the other side of the Trump.
But at the beginning of September, a Monmouth University Institute of Education, Trump and many Republicans have received the support of Trump all the time.
Carly Friina 13 points Marco Rubio to 14 points, Walker's 15 points, 19 points, and finally Rand Paul, John Casich and Christie.
Ted Cruz with you.
The only island you've eaten him?
I'm in trouble with this incident, I'm going to 19 points.
Donald Trump says most of the supporters decided.
A new CBS/NYT socket that supports Trump shows that more than half of the votes that support Trump.
Obviously, there's a lot to do to change it, and nobody can tell you that you really will change your mind.
He said they left the door open to change 46%.
The biggest official of Trump is Ben Carson, but the voters who say they're making decisions will be closer to the vote for Trump.
He says six of the Republicans agree with Trump about immigration.
Two months ago in the campaign, Donald Trump was released at the beginning of 2016 talks and the central center.
Some think that Trump's many conversation would damage the Hispanic elections from the Republican Party and the attempt to restore the market.
However, on Monday, the new EU/Post Act says that six of the Republicans have the same opinion with Trump on immigration.
I mean, it looks like Trump's staying in my day as long as he stays in my life.
The anger of anger in the government climbs up to new degrees.
Donald Trump and Ben Carlson, because of their circumstances out there, they get half of the Republicans out there.
On Monday, the new EU/Pott agency says every 10 members of every 10 Republic of the government asked someone outside instead of the government's experience.
And they're angry with Washington.
Two weeks ago in Iowa, Des Moines Register/Bloomberg alerted all four members of the Republics in Iowa, showing that 54% of the Republicans were "not" and 21 percent were "intent."
The prime minister's questions will be the first time Jeremy Corbyn will go up.
From the day he was selected, Mr. Corbyn was expected to stand on the line at the Prime Minister's Solar Program
Herrmy Corbyn, leader of the New Worker Party, first time David Cameron, will go to the District of Prime Ministers.
Mr. Corbyn will be asking six questions a little later this afternoon, and his performance looks like a closer look at the media and business party.
He called "at least theatre and more real".
He also said that some of his colleagues could jump out to his colleagues.
This encounter will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corbyn's leadership, the shadow ship, and the speech of the TUC annual convention.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister of Business Party was arrested by some Tory Millets in the newspaper, while the annual meeting was held on Tuesday of December 75 B.C.E. to celebrate the anniversary of the International War of England.
Mr. Corbyn's decision to associate with the national March
A word that Mr. Corbyn spoke for her name says she was standing up in a "good silence" and appreciates the heroic hero in England's War.
However, in explaining that Mr. Corbyn's shadow career is one of his members, Owen Smith BiBC suggested that two of the business parties would be "uncertainly" because he believed that he could remove the World Power program.
At least six members of parliamento parties rejected him as a leader when he refused to serve in the upper team of the parliamento parties because of the differences in defense, defense, and external relationships.
BBC political reporter Robin Brant says that political differences began in the Executive Party, and these have been identified as the position of Mr. Corbyn's position on the European Union and the government's responsibilities.
At Mr. Corbyn TCU's conference, he said that the employee Party has made new changes to remove the highest limit.
At hours later, the shadow and retired minister Mr. Smith said that the party was in opposition to the highest limit of the government, and it was "very clear."
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth executive leader of the Ambassador Party in the history of David Cameron.
The manager of the employee Party has promised a different approach in politics, and said Mr. Cameron has received more advice than 30,000 advice.
Ilington noted that the headmaster of North National Court is a multi-technical engineer, and the term "supervised" and that the word "supplies" refers to poverty, poverty, poverty, and suffering that young people face.
Mr. Corbyn said when he wasn't himself, for example, when Mr. Cameron went abroad, for example, he would represent the Prime Minister Angela Eagle in the Shadow Program.
He even suggested that his fellow colleagues would come up with this position, and he said that he would apply to John Bercow, the author of Aram Kamath.
In 2005, Mr. Cameron was often asked to get away from the "Kukla Game" style, associated with the Prime Minister Question program, but a few years later, he admitted he had failed in this situation.
Since the first time published in 1990, Prime Minister Sorus's program was used as a primary measure in determining the rights of leaders in the region of Avam, as well as the national firms in Kamak, asking that some protesters have been forced to justify and require extensive reforms.

Metcatish has launched a public campaign to fight the Islamist.
Metash is trying to protect the IGA stores in South Australia and Western Australia from an Aid attack.
Marketsman Metcatsha, South Australia, and Western Australia started a campaign to defend their perked stores against 700 million dollars.
At the beginning of the next year, two distribution centres and numbers in South Australia were built to strengthen their relationship with local gangsters, including the United States and the IGA.
IGA is also credited with brandsbough-based ice cream manufacturers and faithful customers, such as Dunsboogh, who have received a good test in the IGA store.
It is expected to present more information about the annual investor strategy of the annual investor strategy on June 29, 2010.
Risk represents nearly 30% of the IGA bus stations in Western Australia and Western Australia Metcastes, and produces more than the IGA network in the eastwestern United States.
South Australia and Western Australian store workers have been uncontaminated, and the IGA personnel have been able to produce a more powerful market market in NSW, Victoria and Queensland; see also 30% of the U.S.A.
However, the analysts like Morgan Stanley believe Aldi's first store in the next 12 months will take approximately 5% of the market market market, but the current players will usually take off the pharmaceuticals.
In a report published this week, Morgan Stanley announced that the IGA personnel would lose $250 million in a year, and Metcash's $250 million in the year 2016.
This guess is, Aldi's next year will open up 30 stores in GA and BA, and he's hoping he'll get $500 million in every market, and he'll pay for $600 million.
Mr. Kierath said that the loss of food and market sales and the high-speed quality market can cost Metcash up to $13 million a million dollars ahead of interest.
At the same time, Metash also lost the market market market in the Middle East, although IGA clients are the most loyal clients of the IGA.
According to Morgan Stanley, Mtash's prices and market sales will be reduced in 2016 at 3.8.8.1% in 2017 and 2018, and 20% of the market share will be reduced by 20% in 2015.
Next week, Miguel Fincial Group founder Hamish Douglas, manager of the leader, said that he could be able to remove Metcash's "in the past few years."
Metash refused to give an answer to Mr. Douglas' comment.
However, it seems that a Metach board member has been contacted by Mr. Douglas the following week.
Since 2010, IGA's market price has been returned to 11%, and nearly 1200 IGA's incomes have been reduced since 2012, sales and cost up to 43% of sales and equipment under the market.
However, the balloter reacts, helping the IGA per week to renew their stores by investing more than 150 million dollars each week in colleges and Woolworths each week, adding a higher-coiling greenhouse market.
The Mtach execution director, Ian Morris, said that the salesman started to produce prices and storage programs, and that he was expected to return to the main car for the first time in 2017.
Thansi Cookkinis is supported by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Thanasis deserves much praise for his behavior.
Tennis Australaia president Steve Healy has been in a state of damage to his friend Nick Krygios, who is in the final disaster, and deserves much praise.
Cookkinis, known as "The Girls", found himself under the guidance of Körgios in Montreal Masters, who did not approve of Stan Wawrinka because he was not at all welcome.
During the struggle game that started this afternoon in Cinnati, Kokkinakis and his opponent, Ryan Harrison, and his opponent, Ryan Harrison, said, "Wawrinka, I have to go over that boy."
The last year in the US Open, Richard Gasquet, who was loyal to him when he was able to break up his race, and he remained loyal to Healy.
The young player is now in Glasgow with Sam Groth and his wife, Davis Cup in the final part of Britain, the second of Bernard Tomic's mission.
Healy said, "What I feel so excited about is that I think Tanasi's getting started arguing."
When he was in the U.S. and he broke his opponent in the U.S. and lost, but he's not the first player who broke his opponent's feelings, and I know that Thansi doesn't have to be proud of it.
In reality, however, he has made himself very well under the extreme circumstances of Harrison and others, and I think he deserves a full-scale praise.
He's got a great team, a great family, and I think he's gone a bit too far.
Although she's 19 years old, she's working hard, and she's working so well on her team, and she's having no problem with other players, she's in the dressing room, she's in high respect, she deserves to be judged in her own office.
Healy also supported Kirgios's decision to love him for important association; from Friday to Cuma, he began to explain that what was true for everyone is to "make a good decision" but to return to a long-term iron.
Healy said, "Before all things, we want the team to focus, not on the drawings around [Kyrgios], but on all sides."
And I think it's a child, like Nick, Fererr and Murray, who says that the kid grew up so fast in front of the people, and has done some terrible mistakes, and we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and sometimes when it's not under control, I think it's good for him.
Europe's foreign crisis: Hungary declared an emergency, closed the borders, and captured immigrants.
Hungary has closed the south border on Serbia, while its aim is to cut off the ethnic flow of foreign flow.
Hundreds of immigrants have created chaos on the border, and Serb officials act with rage.
The immigrants who escaped from violence in their own country have moved across the border between the two countries, and moved to these cities.
But their anger increased.
When a police helicopter went upstairs, the immigrants shouted, "Come open!," and Hungary's protested against the violent police.
Some have rejected the amount of water and food that they received.
Serbia's foreign Foreign Minister, Macedonia and Greece, explained that Hungary would not be able to return immigrants.
(Serbia) She wants to be part of the solution rather than damage this process.
"It's gonna have to talk to Brussels and other countries the next time," said Ivica Daicc Pragda.
This tension at the border of Hungary, Serbia, came about a day after a day after the 28 countries did not agree on a common foreign policy at the meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share their responsibility to share with Greece and Italy, and until the next month or after the next year, they had agreed that Hungary would accept 1200,000 immigrant countries.
Germany's Prime Minister Angela Merkel and Austria, on Tuesday, was called to make a next week an EU attack on this foreign crisis.
Hungary doesn't seem to have any hope of taking any social step on Brussels or its neighbors.
In the two South regions, the emergency call is given to the officials to fight against the crisis so that they can shut the way they need, and to speed up the issues of refuge.
On the other hand, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szjjarto said that his country had planned to take over the border to stop the foreign flow from this country.
CBS News reporter Charlie D'Agatta heard that the prisoners in prison were even assigned to prison in prison when they worked with Hungary and Serbia.
Over the last few months, Hungary has come to a significant cross-end point in the European Union, and a large number of these immigrants have escaped from war in Syria and other Middle East countries.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban acknowledged that the majority of immigrants who came to flee to Europe were "economic immigrants" who tried to get away with the views of other EU countries, including Germany.
The laws that entered Hungary in the middle of the night bring greater punishment to human refugee prisoners than they were charged with bringing a long-term complaint against Serbia's border (13 feet) to prevent or damage it.
In a statement to the journalists in the south of Szeged city, the government said, "The Hungarian government declares the reason why the move is moving."
Our idea of something is so clear: it's a crime to pass through illegal ways.
While the military must be approved by the council yet, the Associated Press reporters in the region have been saying they've been seeing dogs and armed with heavy weapons.
The Orban's Department of Security, Gygi Minister, said he caught 15 people in the country who were trying to limit the limits of 45 people.
They've been hurt by foreign wires, now they're accused of being charged with crime for the police and the new laws.
The authorities are repairing wires with speed.
The Hungarian authorities also used a train station to close the seven borders of the seven border between Serbia and Serbia, to close one of them.
In order to accomplish the operations of the Hungarians, people were exposed to a small metal container, which was filled with a small metal container that was filled with the casos Rosske, along with the main border line near the casos Rosske.
If 20 people were in there, there were thousands of out there.
Another group of immigrants said they wouldn't accept gas and water supplies until they shut down Serbia's autonomous highway with Hungary.
>>uzb_Latn<< Choice 2016: Hillary Clinton's superiority to Bernie Sanders has reduced half a million in national choice
Old Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues to take two foreign leadership in the Democratic race, but you, Bernie Sanders.
Clinton is now in my second position with Sanders %27 (%17) when he dropped the Democratic votes (%58).
President Joe Biden, who's not yet explaining it, is taking 15% of the democratic votes.
More than five months before the main race began, most of them said that it was too early for them to decide which island they would support.
But Clinton's supporters have more strong ideas about their choices than those of other islands.
Last month, Clinton has lost his mind between a demographic group since the CBS news, and also has some prizes for Sanders.
Clinton has a big difference between women and girls, but that's the difference.
The support between men grew up, and Sanders just followed him for five points.
Clinton's 50-year-old Democrat voter, and he and Sanders are now in equal position.
But Clinton has a big difference between the old selections.
Last month, Clinton was moving ahead before Sander, between the liberals, but now Sanders are ahead of five points in this group.
At the national level, about half of the Democracy voters would support Clinton with respect to being the island of the party.
A 15% of the other cut will support him only if he's a candidate.
A six-year-old cut doesn't support Clinton.
Maybe in a non-concerned form, Clinton's current supporters are particularly willing to support him with passion.
The differences between those who support Clinton now can be more complicated - only supporting him with passion.
At 48% of the Democrats' conviction that they will support Clinton, less than half of the Republicans are talking about Donald Trump (see page 35.
When Clinton asked his supporters why Clinton wanted to be a candidate, the first answer was that he had the right experience (see 16), the idea that a woman had the right to choose is the best candidate for the job (see verse 13) and that he was the best candidate for work.
Clinton's supporters also ask for his relationship with Bill Clinton (at least 9.
In trouble, it's between the criteria and the selection criteria specified.
As president for the president of the President, 57 percent of Democrat voters may want to see him being in the race, but the three units don't think that way.
When Democratt asks the voters what is the second candidate for the party, the Biden is on top.
More than half of Clinton's supporting points out that Biden may have a second choice.
Biden, if he doesn't go to the Democratic Advantage race, Hillary Clinton's greatness increases to Sanders; the height of 20 points in a race with Biden is up to 30 points in the race.
About 50 percent of Democrat voters are considered to be the best candidate to win Clinton, but this number has been over 78 percent since the last month.
Even though it was second in the brain, there were a number of people who saw him as the most chosen candidate.
Once again, when the most important thing in a island is asked, Democrat voters are kept in front of the voters.
No Democrat voter like the last month does not seem to be accepted as a candidate for the island or the island of the island for the first voters.
Democracy candidates or the island candidates are showing good performances in some aspects of their party's first choices.
Most of them see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as well as those who have strong leadership skills.
Clinton's strong about leadership when he's in the first three of the world's truth.
According to one percent of democracy voters, Clinton is honest and trustworthy, not half of it, but at least 27 percent of it has the same idea for Sanders (at least 15).
Democracy selections also see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden in the same way as their own ideals.
At all levels, the Democratic voters have no idea about Sanders.
During the Ministry's mission, the questions regarding personal e-mail address and server use, most Democrats have found it exciting to explain the relationship between you and him, and their views on him are not affected.
But it's a different story in the American community.
The half of the Americans are not satisfied with his explanations, but only one third finds satisfying.
In March, the views of the people were cut off shortly after the problem was taken under the ladder.
Most American e-mailers say that the general views on Clinton are not affected by the general views on Clinton, and the other is about 36 percent of the negative ideas.
These are usually the Republicans, and more than six people say their views on Clinton.
Even though Clinton was considered honest and trustworthy by his party, he still has a problem with record selections: the only point that when he saw it being honest and trustworthy, the number was reached by eight points from the month of May.
Two percent of the registered voters have dropped him to be honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55% of the registered voters in the whole country are not found honest and trustworthy.
Still, Clinton and Trump are doing well on leadership.
Among the six islands in the test, Biden, Carson, and Bush received the best points about honesty.
More than that, he finds Sanders a lot of time, but most of them don't have any idea about him like he's in Carson.
The error charge from 351 Democrat selected is 6%.
I'm Carlon's back behind Donald Trump on national occasions.
The new CBS News/New York Times offer Ben Carson Donald Trump running near the side of Trump.
The new bill shows that about half of the voters were being tested, and the other candidates have no chance.
The Republicans continue to support Trump in large numbers, with the last CBS of support prior to the dispute in Fox Newss.
But the support for Carson was increased from 6% to23% at the same time.
The company also found that Carson was doing too well in demographic groups, and he found that his college center was higher than Trump among the members of the Republican voters.
Kalans, Carly Forina and Ohio Governor John Cassich, have now fallen to 2% in the last month with the Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker.
The former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubie6.
This was made in September of 376 people chosen from the Presidential elections.
During the last week, the CNN/ORC update showed Trump's support between members of the Republicans in the mid-19% of Trump's 32% support.
The last ant that was made by the EU News/Washington Post was shown in front of Carson.
Trump, who was confronted by Carson's rise last week, apologized for the faith of Carson Trump, but he continued to break up with the medical surgeon.
He said on Saturday on Saturday at a campaign at Iowa, Trump.
Five brothers, Baruch College is accused of the death of the first class
Almost two years after the death of a college student in Pennsylwania, nearly five years after the death of a college student.
New York City Baruch College Pi Delta's sister, September 2013, attacked Chun "Michiel" Deng, and forced him to get to the hospital.
The authorities said that his eyes were closed, a 30-reported backpack, and that he was trying to reach the target in a frozen field.
Mr. Deng complained that his head suffered at time and later lost his knowledge.
Pi Delta Psychiatry members didn't call 911 after the Deng flag and the police waited an hour before they took him to the hospital.
However, by the press conference, the police have changed Deng's clothes, called on Google, and asked for advice to communicate with the international president Andy Meng.
At this point, the members began to hide their personal items and put their brother's favor ahead of Michael Deng.
He couldn't imagine himself and lost his life the next morning.
According to a autopsy report, Deng was derived from the traumas that have been repeated in his head, in his chest, in his chest, and in his hip.
Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer who represented Deng's family, said that a number of families were destroyed as a result of the meeting ceremony, lost at least one student's life since 1970.
Brothers and members must be held responsible for this, and this step is very important.
Monroe's great jury suggested that the first five members of his family were sued by the third degree of murder charges.
Thirty-two brothers, including Mr. Meng, will be charged with the acceptance and punishment against the attack.
He said that if there are not only members involved in a press conference on Tuesday, it's not just those who are involved in it, but it's a matter of official opinion, we will take responsibility for them.
Baruch banned the College brotherhood and ended the relationship with this local community.
What happens when Fed increases his interest rates?
With the rise of the interest rates, the neck market will climb up, and the economy will be able to return.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it's going to take.
In history, especially in economics, very little information about the timing.
It's also about 86 months, just as the initial interest rate took place after 11 months, so it took about 86 months to return.
While the U.S. Central Bank's Fed's lack of interest rates has often been identified in the reaction of economics and financial resources.
That's why the U.S. central bank authorities focus on how much time the investors are going to increase, not on how long they're going to take.
It's a fact that you have different variables.
However, the market participants may think that the damage caused by the interest rate was over.
"It's inevitable that some Fed's initial financial growth of Fed's initial financial growth results in the end of the period of time," says Capital Economics Economics University Julian Jessop.
On the contrary, we don't expect the U.S. interest rates to slow down, but most of the low levels that are still in fear of are extremely high.
But we don't think they're going to have effects.
The response to some areas of the economy that can give rise to the past trains is:
As you can see in the market in the past months, waiting for the increase of the percentage rates can lead to a period of time.
And the effect will not be so significant when it's increased.
In a new study of what will happen after Fed's investment, Deutsche Bank analysts said, "It might be a 12-24 month stop training, which means that the money policy could be maintained."
According to a recent analysis that Bob Dol's Department of Justice in Barron's presence in Barron's, the market has been recorded for more than 35 years, and 14 to 250 days later, the percentage increase (2.50 days later) has increased to approximately 2,50 days later.
Deutsche said that the effect on the parts was increased in the next phase of the activity growth cycle and that it's going to be destroyed.
The regulators are a fact of economic life, but the interest rates help them.
Fed is in a new state, in a number of situations that are not yet existing and can speed up.
The most attention is that it's at the lowest level for the Fed percent increase in quality quality.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 percent of the population that had occurred since 1950, has only been down to four percent of the year's inflammatory properties.
Despite the second quarter of 2015, Atlanta Fed has observed that this situation is very limited to less than 1.5 percent of the population.
According to Deutsche, it may be dangerous to increase the interest rates in such a sensitive economic environment and lead to the question, "Is it different this time?"
The attention of the political participants who wait for the Fed's percentage increase this week is at the Federal Public Commission meeting that will end on Thursday.
While most strategy specialists believe that FOMC can afford a profit at this meeting, the government only refers to 25 percent chance.
In the report, "all the production curves that we've done since1950 have been made up of a super-wheeled climate, which is still going to speed up to the zests before the starting release," he said.
On the contrary, this was an unexplained, unprejudiced, unscrupulously seen during a period of time.
The current cycle has been the longest turn of Fed's long-term cycle that we've been waiting for, and the longest cycle in the area is still in 74.
It's constant in the market, waiting for the interest rate, and it's like a regular ubjection.
The difference is that when the Fed policy changes, it's faster than it's on the boards.
When the first turn comes, they do not change the direction they are given.
At the end of the financial cycle, the crown falls in the moment, Deutsche said.
According to Charles Schwab strategy experts, the increase in interest will improve my pace by making it closer and faster.
Kathy Jones, who said that the high-level boards are usually a better performance in this environment, said that Schwab Anamists often have a better performance, but said, "We're careful to reach the goal."
Interestingly, Jones thinks Fed's political expectations are already on the island.
"In addition to the increase in the power and inflammation expectation of the market, there are various signs that the market has been arranged according to the financial policy," he wrote.
The short-lived percentages increase, the amount of data has increased, increased the amount of credit, and increased the frequency of the FED policy - all the features that will be seen in the market when the FED policy is under attack.
As a result, companies who do most of their jobs in the U.S. will earn more income and local products.
A lot of international companies who owe a lot of money will be worse, the rate of growth will make the products more expensive in the global market and will be even more expensive.
"Tarih, 'kaliteli's part shows that the performance of the sensors can be reduced at the start of such an argument," Goldman Saschs said.
In 1994 and 2004, companies with powered companies have spent five percent of their age compared with those who have grown weak rates.
The companies with low-powered and low-speed sensing sensors have a lower quality cancer (in 4) and 3 averaged.
The debt is going to be a big deal.
According to Goldman, companies who owe high-speed rule are the most harmful.
In addition to the quality money game, the consumers are expected to be able to benefit from the extra dollars.
While experts have different ideas about how fast they can hold, the designers can also come out of high prices.
Andrew Bingham told me a copy of BBC Radio 3 Class FM.
The reporter Andrew Bingham's station has accused the station of "Bingham"
The radio's been a little more than a trader on the way out.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards and accused him of stealing his Brittties
Her cousin Dameen Collins accused The Voice of not being self-defenseed
A member who came back, he sent the message to the BBC Radio 3 to call the class FM to reveal the difference between his other trading stations.
Andrew Bingham also said that the radio channel that gave public service to the BBC boss was "inflammation" and that the trader went off.
He said, "I don't like to use this table, but Radio 3 "he's boozeed," he said, "he's going back to Class FM."
And this also showed the BBC Music Awards for the first time in December.
The BBC Music Awards last year are on another version of the Britt Awards.
"If you're trying to do something different, these are the first two examples I've ever thought about, you're just getting the same thing in the market," Bingham said.
BBC's general manager rejected charges and claimed that the BBC Radio 3 needed a live music was the key to public education in public education.
If I'm learning from radio 3, I'm going to go and learn something about classical music.
And it's devoted to living music, and music can't be compared to anything else.
He also said that radio 3 was a very important thing to discover new music and work effort.
BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davey said that the radio should be more focused on the history of the radio so that the British may have less training at the classic music industry.
However, Radio 3, Culture, Media, and the Sport election meeting wasn't the only one who was assigned to the ball because the BBC's trader went to the east of its trading competition.
National Tory Dameen Collins de O Sound - The Wallada's Wallada company has purchased 22 million sterline skills from Talpa Media.
Can't you see why your program brings so much sound, because it's not self-defense and there's no special difference?
Lord Hall insisted that Paloma Faith and Boy George's jury was "a more member of the BBC"
He said he wanted him to find a hive of his own blood before he could do another fun program.
He did not accept the idea that he would be able to prevent that sound program in the future or that he would spend some other formats on his license fee.
The reason why the Internet sales in August is the worst cost of history?
In the first three months of 2015, there was a seven - percent increase in Internet sales
Since the year 2000 the records began to be broken, the lowest growth has been recorded.
Three years ago mobile devices began to be used in shopping, and there were explosions on the Internet.
The experts say that Black Cuma could be part of the market in November.
The internet has been on the Internet for more than ten years, and England's most liveest shopping streets to the ghost town.
In the first three months of 2015, researchers reported that only seven percent of online sales have shown that online sales have shown that online sales have increased rates.
According to the last year in August, only a fifth increase was recorded, and the record has been considered the lowest growth since the year 2000.
In the first three months of 2015, researchers reported that only seven percent of online sales have shown that online sales have shown greater strength.
"If you look at the growth levels of recent years and particularly 2000, you'll actually see everything is going back to normal."
He added that three years ago, Internet sales were recorded as a large increase in sales marketing.
This means that even more people can get shopping while they're running in the seat.
But now he's going to bed, you'll see the landing.
Black Cuma phanomini from America is considered to be one of the reasons why sales are slow.
Experts say that consumers can expect this effect on the last Friday of November to buy something.
During the last year, five times more expensive products were attacked by companies' web sites to take over.
The researchers argue that Black Cuisines might be "sitating" for the sale of customers
A study published by the British Perakeder Association has shown that every 5 sterline sales from the Internet has been wasted on the goal.
Like TV and laundry machine, one of the three products are now purchased from the Internet stores.
Besides, more than four people buy their clothes and shoes from the Internet instead of buying their expensive shopping streets.
The Muslims who lost their lives in a venomous accident in Mexico with the crime of the Bin Ladin family.
The 29 people who lost their lives in the streets after the first funerals in school were moved by Muslims.
Suudi was responsible for the responsibility of the vinç accident in Arabia.

A vencincies were drawn to hundreds of Muslims who lost their lives because they lost their lives.
Mostly in the whites, the first funerals of whites have opened their way for success in the last trip in the Mujaym Museum in Mexico.
A few days ago, the city of a vencination was a holy place where a prostitute lived on the streets.
At the same time, 394 wounded were also brought to trial after the establishment of the Royal Kingdom of Saudi kingdom to take responsibility, after the deaths of the dead.

Suudi leaders said that Hacca would continue with thousands of inmates on the road to the Lake City.
The King Salman said today should not give up the control of the Indian Holding group while it's out.
In the Arabic version of the interpretended by the State, it was said that the only side to blame for the incident was Bindin Group.
The News Agency's English service didn't go through this, but he reported that the firms were allowed to leave.
At the beginning of the week, Salman swore that at the end of the month, thousands of Muslims would find the Messhi-i Hamm's hunting.
There was no explanation about the bindin group, and its representatives were not allowed to comment.
The royal firm accused not to take new security measures and cooperate with the meteorological authorities.
The Sacred Mosque is located in the Sacred Mosque, where many of these buildings are located are built in the control of the Berlin group.
Bindin's family has been in close ties with Saudi Arabia for over a period of time, and most of the construction projects have been named.
Al Kaide's last organization leader Osama Bin Ladin was a son of the family.
In an accident, severe wind, and rain, every adult Muslim who has only seen a few days ago, has only been able to visit the land of Hac, just a few days ago.
The authorities reported that 158 were still treated in the hospital.
The authorities gave their families and the lives of those who died with a permanent illness to their families and with permanent loss of health.
The other wounded will take half of this amount.
The B&Q boss says there are Eastern European temples working behind this train
Veronicique Laury says that the British have been hired to do more.
In the back of this series, the number of Eastern Europeans is sleeping
As a result, 200 new Screwfix stores are further opened up.
There's also a 60 B&Q sale line in the country.
>>uzb_Latn<< Written by Rupert Steiner, Daley Mail City Chief of the City of Islam
It's said that the British were starting to hire Eastern European congressers to do their jobs instead of putting them in their hands and paint knifes.
If you're capable of using a hammer or a wall paint, it means you're fewer in these days.
Because, according to the company behind B&Q, the British have been working more hard to do the DIYs in their homes.
The new general manager of the house healing chain, Veronique Laury, said that there was a large increase in the number of Eastern European suppliers who served under this train for low prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 new Screwfix store for the viewers while closing the 60 B&Q line point.
Mrs. Lauriy wants more women to be hired at the B&Q store because he said eight women were given by women when he decided to buy ten purchases in the store.
The majority of the personnel are right now, man.
The single woman who made more repairs in the past said that the home of a single woman who was able to recover more often needs to meet the progressal demographics.
Mrs. Lauriy said, "There's still men working in our mines.
We need to set up more balances.
Half of our clients are taken by 80 percent by women and women who have been bought.
Women play a big role in making decisions.
In fact, the British firm's grandfather, Mrs. Lauriy, who was one of the five women in the head of the FTSE100, was able to rebuild the upper team of men and women.
The Kingfisher, including the general manager and the financial manager, is nearly alone in this area with a total of 50 percent of the team's members from women.
"It's a well-known decision -- it's something important here.
It wasn't hard to find good women to get into our board.
After carrying the cost of closed stores, Kingfuser and an enemy in gold and selling.
In the end of the Trend, Screwfix and the owner of B&Q will open 200 new store
The U.S. Central Bank's time for the FED.
The U.S. Central Bank's two days are observed by the world around the world, and ten years later, it is expected that the percentage rate will increase.
They think that this decision will be held between 0.25 and 25 percent of the time when we say that we're about 80 economies are going to make this decision by Reuters.
This is a historical event since FED's exposure to zeros has passed today.
"We'll see the progress of a large central central bank from a zero point of view to the regular rate of activity," Peterson said.
According to the U.S. economies, the U.S. economies are also adding a lot of trilytons to the process of re-engineing and creating a small amount of inflation.
However, FED can't look at the global tab that is less promising.
He warned the market against an increase, but there is evidence that the situation would not be able to reach such a high level.
It'll be heard at 7:00 a.m. on Thursday.
The murder at Delta State University left a financial note.
On Tuesday, the authorities said that Shannon Lamb had left his girlfriend with a gun in Mississippi in the morning and said he was the first "grand" to kill his friend before he died the same day.
The Mississippi Gautier police called at Delta State University, Lamb's training at 10:00 hours.
He said he killed a gun with a gun.
Lamb said he should send the police on the phone.
"I killed my wife last night," Lamb also said that there was a sweet dog who couldn't hurt anyone.
Although the police asked him his name, he didn't call it.
Lamb didn't even explain any details about the murder.
When the police went to the scene, a note written by Amy Prentiss' lifeless body and his 45-year-old Lamb said, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, if I could get back in time."
I loved Amy so much, and she was the only one who ever loved me.
After writing this note, he went to Delta State and killed his history professor Ethan Schmidt, and then the cops killed him.
He said that there was a problem between William LaForge, Lamb and Schmidt, but he said, "There are some things in your mind."
Despite the reports on Tuesday that Lamb's girlfriend was convinced that Prentidtt was having a emotional relationship with Schmidt.
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Princes for about seven years, is known as "one person."
Double divorced 15 years ago, but their friendship took them.
O'Steen told me that a 19-year-old girls were found and the girl was "born."
O'Steen also said she and her daughter were "the best friend of each other."
According to Linsday Kowles, Sun Herald's close friend, he was working on the Internet from the Prentices' home.
He said Prentiss, who had a hunting dog on Light's name, had been with Lamb for about three years.
He said, "He always liked to help others."
The police said, "I won't go in."
The same night, when the police approached him in Highwy near Greenville 1 at his side, he hit the side of Lamb, ran into the forest, and killed himself with a gun.
According to the CV's website on the University site, Lamb was a student at the University of Delta in Delta State University.
Stars that lost their old age
He spent a few years with his son, Redmond, who was seen by his son.
He fought in 2001, and in 2009, his life friend Farrah Fawcett sacrificed his cancer victim.
The actor, said he was involved with drugs, was arrested in 2008.
All of this, of course, hurt him very much.
Luke Shaw is out there for months out of Manchester Union.
Luke Shaw's right leg has suffered from two brokens in the PSV Eindhoven in the Manchester Union's League.
The incident that saved the defense player is hoping that Louis van Gal Shaw could return this season for at least six months.
In 15 minutes, Hécor Moreno and his 20-year-old game fell into a bomb.
During nine minutes, the field was investigated and then needed oxygen to be provided before the hospital was loved.
Van Gala said, "When I'm in the hospital, it's broken and it's now in the hospital."
He'll be loved today or a day later and will be taken to surgery in Manchester.
A young man who's been transferred to Manchester at the age of18 will take a hard time, then get a great game and then come back to it.
He had oxygen mask in his dressing room.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you've broken out of a couple, this means at least six months, and it means you can't play in the group.
I hope you can play this season again.
Moreno was lucky to get his sword off the red card and the salad.
Judge Nicholas Rizzoli didn't punish Mexico.
Van Galal led the Italian authorities to make a mistake.
You can judge yourself when I say that it's a refuge and a red card.
He was a terrible fight with two legs.
And Shaw said to me, "Thank you for all of you, I'm not enough to tell you what I'm going through, I'm going to start, and I'm going to get up."
He's living in the hospital of Luke Shaw, who's doing Manchester United Nations PSV.
The Champions who will be held in France next July will be forced to heal the League English defense player.
PSV's technical director Phillip Cocu said, "It's a terrible mistake."
If any player's dealt with such a injury, everybody feels sad.
The aim of our players is never to hurt his opponent.
Moreno also had a leg attack against Van Gala in 2014 against Holland.
Cocu finds it hard, because his purpose was never to hurt his opponent, and after hearing that it was too bad, it wasn't good, it wasn't good.
I couldn't see that moment in my mind.
The only thing I can see was a ball in a different direction, like Moreno touched him, but I couldn't see Luke's play.
"I know what feeling you're feeling, I know how hard it's going to be.
I feel so bad about that, and I'm so sorry.
The battle with Chris Smalling in PSV was lifted up in the hospital with Chris Smalling.
Of course, does David know more about Cameron The Lorax?
It's one thing that every parent knows that when you love a book, you know that it will not take much time for you to learn about it.
Looks like if you're not David Cameron.
When a child was asked what his favorite child book was, the Prime Minister, Dr. Seauss, chose Dr. Seaus's own environmental table in 1971 when he asked what he loved to do with the child care.
"I like to read the book that's a hard decision on the SuperCamps website, which says it's a difficult decision, encouraging, creative, and powerful message, since I always have a sign or a message in it, I'm going to read to my children."
It's all going so well, so it's just that Cameron wrote something about the memory book, but in fact, the new characters and details added to the 2012 presentation version of the book that was added to the 2012 production version.
"A child who wants to see a real tree in his dream to win the heart of Audrey, who died in 1991, and died in 1991.
If this wasn't enough of you, it's very similar to the text you received by Cameron's short description of the film The Lora film in The Lora film, saying, "All things are going to take place in the city of Thneed-Ville, which is a wall of the city named Tede-Ville."
According to the claims that all of her work is a parent, Cameron is a child's name in the local environment, the name of Lorax, which gives her the name of a young child, and the book that says "the name of the dragons" and "the trees," it doesn't seem to wonder how she was destroyed by those trees.
It's probably about 20 times the work of a weak people with this sort of weak nation has been moved to an order, and it has been reported that The Lorax has not read to a child more than 20 times.
A lady of the president's talks said that the text came from Cameron's election office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was confirmed by Cameron's staff, but there was no comment.
Adam Lyth was in a position to get out of England, but he's still unsatisfactory.
It's a difficult task to play with Pakistan in the United Arab Empire, but once you saw the British team for a tour, I think again the 3rd-0-0 test series has been in the cards.
I'm still not leaving a deployment.
Alastair Cook's team may be more inexperienced than three years ago, but there are players who are better at the shooting line, and they're strong, and they're just a few young people who don't get better results.
In the game game, Moeen Ali is growing as a playflower, and Adil Rasid represents a father's son-in-law, even though his quality is not known.
It's interesting: Adam Lyth got out of the British Navy team, and Alex Halles was taken instead
It's a difficult decision to analyze Adam Lyth as the chief engineer in Newshire.
The seven measures were against two good horses in hard conditions, but the inevitable reality is that the crickets are being judged according to the end.
For example, Joe Root didn't have any questions about Root, because as I said earlier, the players were the best choices.
After a few fifty seconds, Lyth could've seen the career disappear, but he appointed his destiny.
I hope you'll get another chance for the New Yorkshire.
Even though the British chief Trevor Baylis didn't show his best performance, he didn't surprise me; he was a team man before everything.
It's hard to answer the question of how long a tryer takes his note.
Lyth - Like Sam Robson before him, he took seven pups, and on the other hand, Nick Compton received nine.
Only Compton got a chance to win the interview.
The only one you can feel is that Jonathan Trott could first go to the Caribbean -- when Lyth's form was in the ground -- but it's still in history.
Alex Halles is coming, and I think it's a high-level shot.
A cricketer in X-factership, and this was at the beginning of this season, when we saw 236 times on the Trent Bridge area at Newshire.
At least it has to be taken for the same opportunity before it, but of course it depends on the team of the United Arab Emirates.
The idea that Moeen would have made Cook's opening up to play a lot of games while holding four quicks, and I'm not against it.
I don't know why a hitman didn't shoot here, so this left-hand holdinger has already shown how good it is as a cricket.
Moeen could not do his job for the city of Worcestershire, but he saw a number three for them, and there's no difference.
My former team friend Justin Langer played his first 38 Denge in 2001.
Three hundred rings shut down, and he didn't look behind.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup player, and surprises me as an impressive young man in the intense talks I have done with him.
People can also see the statistics - 31 mediums and 35 averages in the ball, and they can think it's an aggravat, but there's no too many games that lift their hands, and the player choices are made by young people.
He'll learn a lot about this tour.
It looks like England has made a few correlations in his own anti-training team.
The Sri Lanka shot may have been a great priority for Mahelaha Jayawardene as a consultant for the Deneme Games.
He's one of the favorite men of that game; he will bring a full-float experience in every direction and all the horses.
Paul Collingwood is coming for the white ball, and he's making a brutal fortune for the game.
I always thought he was born for the international crisis, as he was a player or an artist, and there's a sense of understanding that can be taken by Mahela.
Sometimes new sounds in the dressing room, even if the messages mentioned before, can bring a new innovation to my team.
Colly's team friend, Ben Stokes, has been listening to a day-to-day games, and I have no problem with this.
Without the same opinion, not everyone is doing the same by the plans, actors, and players.
And you must not forget that, like players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions will never be easily taken.
By 2017, the economy can win the Brexit camp
David Cameron's plan to keep Britain in the United States is getting worse every day, and the situation goes worse every day, and that's "Yes?" Hermy "Yes?" or "No," or "The Corbyn's Business Party went off to Europe on Tuesday.
The strangers have Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
Recently, a European diploma said that some members of the State, who didn't really want to be involved in the crisis, most of them didn't want to, Britain's simply self-explanation, and their actions are all over the day.
The TUC decided that he didn't want to protect the social protection during the annual meeting in Brighton.
We can even call it Dave and George's own day.
Prime Minister and Chancellor, they take their own pictures in front of foreign countries or in front of the famous cities, and then send them back to their countries for reform.
That's all about me.

"No talks again," and "Britan had nothing to do with the discussion."
The Europeans knew how devastating Fleet Street was from the previous experience, and they didn't have the EU at the time of the Oligic press barons, and they were inspired by the 1975 revision of our release in 1973.
At the beginning of the mid-90s, the British reporter named "Aberration," the head Euro-portinist Bois Johnson, is the same thing.
He knew about the enemies of Ed Milband once again.
There were taxpayers, illegal phone calls, and many of our large newspaperers were foreign officials.
Tony Blair often thought about these things, and she and her husband had to pay attention to it when they stayed in a gorville cage with a little gorge, and she realized that she and her lunch hour didn't have to pay attention to her lunch and tea.
In fact, Milinband was also the Blacker from the Blacker who gave him an exit card from the French and Dutch voters who had been canceled in 2005.
The press didn't forgive him at all.

He says he wants us to stay in a former EU.
Many other people who are outside Wikipedia's hostile climate say yes.
It's what Hiryry Bennte said that this week, when he was called on radio and television, he forced himself to admit that Corbyn was a bad idea to claim John McDonnell to be a shadow.
This reminds me of her father's struggle to be unfaithful to his colleagues at the TV show, often going too far, and losing his office.
Hirin's fight was even more attractive.
But it was the same thing that McDonnell said to the people at the special meeting that he said to the people at the special meeting on Monday night.
And if we see that she touched me, she continues to keep her message in the world of 7/24 TV, despite the fact that Corbyn was trying to share.
As McDonnell says, it is vital to make trouble with Europeans to ensure that Cameron's support of the employee party in my conference.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks that.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture E-sigaa Research
Researchers reported that there were 12 people who had been associated with a government agency that had been associated with the industrialism of tobacco, and 95 percent less harmful than smoking.
Researchers at the British Medical Laboratory (BMJ) joined Lancet on evidence he used in his report about the British Government Health (PHE).
The PHE published the report on the "floor point of study" of "the parents" last month.
But some researchers questioned the health of the data and focused on the connection between experts and tobacco.
Lancet's previous headline was the target of the PHE's main objective.
The other two researchers who wrote in BMJ have questioned whether the claim is "the person or the rock was built on it."
In London, European health professor Martin McKee and Liverpool University, Simon Campwell said, "The effect of public health is on the effect of public health."
Kammin's PHE said that "mevutt is about 95% less harmful than smoking" would expect evidence and modeling to continue to be a significant study of evidence and modeling.
In fact, it is a 12-dimensional study of a series of 12 men gathered together to develop the model model (MCDA).
McKee and Capewell said one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company named EuroSwiss Healco, who had previously received an independent research.
They also said that BAT approved the public health document in the report of a transfer.
He added that one of the 12 people in the meeting had received a fund from an e-gara producer, but he said he had already received a report from Philip Morris International Investigation company.
The panel members did not know how to be elected, but some of them are included in some of the most known countries in the article.
Some of the other people who were present at the meeting are unaware of the benefits of tobacco control.
The PHE's responsibility for the meeting was taken.
McKee and Campewell wrote that the search article "in the proper way" of research has expressed a lack of evidence about the damage of many species.
But none of these connections or exceptions are discussed in the PHE report.
"There's no evidence for smoking for those who don't smoke with children or cigarettes," MCKee and Capew said.
Prof Kevin Fenton, professor of health and reform at PHE, said he was already responding to claims in BMJ.
He said, "E-sigators are less harmful than smoking."
One of the two people who have been smoking for a lifetime die of this addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks caused by e-sigarates are small, but we must continue to examine long-valve effects.
The PHE has a clear case: in a time when people are overwhelmed with tobacco, and in a period where evidence shows and doesn't show up.
Almost 80,000 people die from a disease related to smoking in the year, and smoking is cost 2 billion dollars a year to NHS.
The clear evidence is that even if e-scigaran isn't a risk, we're going to make it clear that the harm caused by smoking is only a small part of our national responsibility.
He said the previous four chiefs should leave the BBC EastEnders.
Previous Channel 4 president Luke Johnson said BBC should stop programs such as EstEnders and The Voice and The Voice, and he said that his advertising opponents can give their "right arms" for the Albert Square series.
Johnson said that the license fee should be used to make programs that are not only used by the other English publishers.
BBC was criticized for moving the public service programs that could be observed by a small audience group, in contrast to the most recent retailed programs in the precious series.
About six years later, BBC's general director Tony Hall said that the organization wants to cooperate more with other organizations; Johnson said that it was in his time of four years in order to build a relationship with the United States.
"I'm trying to order and publish programs that can be shown directly by the BBC's communications company in connection with the future," Johnson said in an interview with the UNC.
If you're not sure that you're a good idea or a long time, I'm not sure if you're doing a license fee, the exit should be sent to the programs that no one else has done or ordered.
It's published between The Voice's primtime, because they want to provide as much support as I can in the future.
The main idea here is that it's ridiculous and ridiculous.
"I don't know why programs that can't be useful should be dealt with with with an average tax.
There's one of the Voices, EastEnders, and the other in real company.
To be honest, the other channels have their right arms for this.
I'm trying to see how public service works.
I don't think it's going to be the same as BBC.
Johnson, who runs 4 from 2004 to 2010, was accused of trying to secure this close approach for the long-term support of the BBC."
The descriptions of BBC's most popular programs are repeated by the Sky Director Tony Ball in 2003 using the MacTaggart class in order to sell their programs such as the BBC EstEnders.
Johnson said that BBC's more appropriate public service programs are going to BBC4 and that the monitor will not be able to do this here, but he will argue that he agreed to pay the tax price, and that four billion sterline workers are able to continue the dysfunctional tasks, and said, "We're doing all these things to do."
They're putting these in empty spaces that no one ever saw.
Concerning the license fee, Johnson said to the committee: "I invite you to find a more critical system than those who benefit from it.
Of course, you all think of us, we all think of 150 pounds a big value a year, but I wonder if there's a lot of reasons why 150steries do not have to do this because they're so big.
David Elstein, former directors of the Soviet and Chancellor on Tuesday, said he should reiterated the Reithian mission to "responsion, training, and fun"
He said that some of the BBC's exit training is now being held as public education - and that the radio output is 0.1%, and that the public service in Australia and Canada should be legislatured, and should be replaced with "planning, recognition, and training."
He said Elstein should be involved with the commercial broadcasters to do something on the TV but only a few of the proms shown on TV, and to make sure all of them appear online.
'Soogenetics' enables brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how the rope methods are being replaced by sound waves.
Science people have the ability to develop cortisol systems that have been controlled by sound waves.
The small silk wolves quickly change when they're being shot by sound waves that people can't hear.
Traffics are used as genetically modified motor nerve cells that respond to sound waves.
Important: Students read the brain activity with light
Researchers said they confirmed the power of a new process called Sonogenetic, so ultrasound can be used to activate the brain, heart and muscle cells from the body.
He told Sreecanth Chaladian, who was in California at La Jolla, that once a day, he could take the position of a phosphorylation of the human brain to cure the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
They don't often react to noises, but when Chalasaini is surrounded by a microscopic shell, they have found that they react to the reaction.
The sound that you find is powered over the waves, so they're able to pass through the wolf.
The powered sound is affected by the structures called TRP-4 ion channels.
According to a report published in Natural Communications, sound waves are able to activate the opening of these ion channels and their binding cells.
In order to create the silk tools controlled by the audio, Chalasani has changed the methods of some motor neurons to carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When the sound is applied to the creatures, the sound waves were used by micro-carblowers, and the engines were added to the micro-carbacts, and used here.
This process is a process that is similar to an optogenetic that enables scientists to run neurons with light waves and close them.
But Chalasani says you can have some advantage in this technical way.
Unlike the light that should be sent within the brain, the lower frequency waves can pass through the tissue and thus be sent to the brain.
Shesani said, "We believe that the human neurons who are targeted for specific neurons for specific neurosciences are able to react effectively to sound signals," she said.
Other applications added that the muscle cells and insulin can be attached to the cells.

According to the National Institute of Technology and Essex University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioned every day and seek ways to move to churches outside of political goods.
Most artists are moving in their actions with activeists, and they start to realize that their arts need to come into the real world so that they can have an effect on society.
Another weapon deals with the posters who travels in the metro.
In 24 hours, the International Af Agency's video has been conducted by more than 100,000 users of Facebook, and has been created by the VCCP advertising agent, and the audio designer has also prepared as free.
The VCCP creator Matt Lever was so surprised by the noise of weapons against the advertising - and he thought, "Let's give them a campaign that they're trying to escape."
The truth is, they played with the idea of making a traditional institutional advertising, but "they've been so careful with the colors and animating, and they're more attractive."
"They have helped us to create concerns about illegal torture teams," said Tom Davis, from Af Journal of Agriculture.
Now that we need the England government to move, stop torture teams from selling illegally outside our door.

He's the eighth rule of living in a student's offices.
I'm still 11 years old when I'm 19 years old, and I'm still interested in giving gifts and morality, but now I understand the long-term stories of what I'm doing and what I've done about others.

This will lead you to the discussion, and if it's your clippings, it will help you to separate people from other people's interests.
Give people some space.
People's rooms often turn to alcohol receptors, movie night, and public chat rooms, but they're also where people are dressed and put their underwears.
Interest: Don't even think about starting with a relationship to college.
They'll go back to college, and they'll see a bad deal.
Your room may be injective, but many soft corridor rooms develop culture, and this friendship is open to social and life.
It could be hell for someone who tried to store this energy.
In culture, I like you, and I want you to continue our friendship, but I need you to leave a little while, so I can put the energy I spend on you when I communicate with you.
Try to see if a friend of yours is tired of socialization and maybe texting instead of playing the door.
It's like playing the door: do it.
A friend at the student's house, if it wasn't locked, he would have made a policy like he was invited to the door.

Since you started going to college at the top of the dairy season, people's doors were less strange and less strange than those of the 1950s, and I'd like to make you laugh when you're asked for personal questions.
It's a great way to give people homemade equipment.

He's in jail now.
Don't make too loud to keep people sleeping or to study.
It doesn't mean being a good person, but it's because you're the Indians in the glass house.
A girl in my hallway said that she had a little part of the night because she said it was 3 o'clock and that she was her own test in the morning.
It's more likely to answer the answers.
When they finally shut down at 5:00, the girl finally opened her music and locked it up for two hours before she went to the door for her own three hours.
Wouldn't your future wife's moved to the hallway with you be too romantic?
Wouldn't it be weird to think you have a corridor friend wrong, to think you have a future partner, to hang out and see him every day, and to watch your partners get saved?
Of course it's sincere, but if your hot corridor neighbor is definitely not your future husband, at least talk to him for a little while.
When you realize that someone's leaving the key inside the door, it's better to know that the line between the joke and the joke is more thin than the one who's locked up the keys.
It's a good joke, but it'll take time to get back.
You can give someone a valuable and fun lesson about security... but never go into someone's room with a hat and a toothpaste.
Lock your doors and keys in a glass of water, but don't put your stuff in more than twice.

From 2014 to 2014, almost 400 billion dollars spent the end of the year coming to the end of the year, the most deep seawater search projects were released.
According to Wood Mackenzie's research, low oil prices, oil oil prices, oil and gas-market have caused a 380 billion dollars project from Mexico to Africa in a wide range of countries.
The report says that in 2014, 70 percent of the cost of income rates were reduced by $1.5 per cent of 12 years, showing the average amount of oil prices of 12 years.
400 LANDS AND PEOPLES
By making all the oil prices every day, every day, every day, new surprises, the last 12 years, returned to $30 per year to see the lowest level of the 12 years.
"Petroll will fall into 15 dollars," "Petroll now has been released from the water supply company Wood Mackezie's printing of energy advice company, explains how it affects the industry.
In July, the report was published, it was announced that the average oil prices of 200 billion dollars of 200 billion energy investment would be reduced by Wood Mackazie, who said that the new study would reveal where this number was reached by 2015.
Thus, during the last six months of 2015, 22 major projects were registered in the year 2014, with the release of the oill collapse.
The value of these projects is about 400 billion dollars.
LATER 2.9 MILLION VARIE
In research on the impact of low oil prices, the most effective projects are sea development projects.
While the project's project is being held in a collection of 27 billionaires, every day, 29 million oil production of 29 million carrots are being delayed.
According to research, most projects of the project were registered between 2017 and after 2017, and then the first production goals of 2020 to 2023.
Among the 68 projects mentioned in the preceding five years, 170,000 billion postal investors reported the position of sea dollars. "The vast majority of about 1,70 billion dollars of marine dollars."
And that's why it's too high for the economy.
"The 70% of the marine wastes" is said to have been built on oil production in Nigeria, Angola, and the United States."
According to research, countries with the most unexpected oil project include Canada, Angola, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Norway, and the United States.
This six countries have 90 percent of their current heat supply.
The largest amount of gas receptors, including Mozambique, Australia, Malezia, and Indonesia, are creating 85 percent of the population.
While the large part of the natural part that is waiting for out here is the deep sea, it requires complex and expensive development, such as the formation of a zero.
Indicating that the most dangerous companies, deep seawater, Canadian oil firm, and Hazar region, it is also said that companies are more vulnerable to heavy heavy oil prices.

It was four years ago: the United States and Europe brought the gold oil to the city's nuclear program, and the oil price was about 110 dollars, and the Iraqi oil industry was discussing how to prevent a sudden damage in prices.
When we get back this week, we see a different script.
For the first time in 2004, Petrol prices saw $30 for the first time, and this was the initial cause of production in the United States, and the ambargos that applied to Iran.
So the eyes are on Iran.
In the case of Iran's oil export, there will be a greater oil market, which means he's very full of oil.
This could also cause the prices to get under the pressure of us today.
Some analysts say that Saudi Arabia who doesn't want to close the market would have a lot of oil, and it would be a war between Iran and S. Arabia.
The investors will not rise, and Iran's main goal is to record the oil market that grew rapidly by India and the former partners in Europe.
In the first report, the Iranian authorities said that they intended to increase 5000,000 per day and then take up the amount of marketing.
According to Reuters' map information, 22 advisors waiting for heavy oil transporters (VLCC), at least 13" are completely full or large.
Iran is in the country with the four most convincing oil receptors in the world.
According to my research, Iran is still making almost 1 million oil exports in some countries, including Turkey.
Prior to the revolution, Iran's daily oil went from 3 millionaires a day to 3 million.
"When the central global growth continues to increase the risk of loss in oil prices in oil prices, oil prices cause loss in oil prices."
We see that in China, the largest oil dealer in China, the economic slowing of the world's economies, resulting in the loss of oil demand, from the year 20% of the losss.
We can also witness to $30 in the next few days under the oil prices in the global scale and the global cost of global goods.
As long as we don't see permanent prices on a 32-3-33 level, the oil can be limited, and the pressure can increase.
At this point, it's said that there's a key role in the presence of the intuitions under a crystal 30 dollars level.
In such a situation, there should not be a surprise to see the effects of a wave of 2330-25.60 support zone.
My workam Sardouk: 'Melek' is over!'
Why did you turn the course into Turkey when Victoria's secretary and the world determines its natural actors?
- I'm always wrong.
I was born in Paris, living in London, then went to New York.
I've got important positions there, too.
At this time, I've been a consultant for Coton for the past two years.
And then I saw the potential in this neighborhood and at the Coton Center.
I realized that there was anything necessary to become a store chain in the world.
Now I'm here to do this.
Can you make it for a short while?
- Exactly.
Although it's still a young market, it's still sold in 50 countries.
We're taking 50 collections a year, 15 separate parts.
So there's everything you have to have a store chain.
From Cuba, we can give Moscow to the needs of consumers in different geographical areas.
Now we're opening a store in Paris in March, and it's the beginning of a new and exciting period...
You want to go to the store in Paris?
- Yeah.
It's not because Europe's economic situation is fantastic.
But you'll open some stores for an image.
Paris, like London, you'll have a shop in fashion, get money from Middle East.
One is a presite cat, the other is the money, and both are necessary for a market that plays a position.
Well, let's talk about the train...
- There's a lot of romantic music in front of us.
The flying syllables, soft tones, pinks, whites, red.
Tell me...
We're going through a lot of hard times, and the fashion world is always trying to make a sense of happiness in my social life.
That's what we did.
That's why the new season comes back in the new season.
Let's go back to your years in Victoria's Secret.
>>uzb_Latn<< Who was the most legendary angel?
I'm not just talking about the awesome physics: that's so positive, she's such a good girl!
When I was working, they sat with me, saying, "Man, you're hungry," they fed me with apples.
That was so sweet.
And you know what I've been talking about and I've been interviewing all Victoria's Secret models.
Isn't Carolina beautiful?
But Adriana Lima was very impressed with her beauty.
- Yeah, that sound!
That's the conversation, that's...
You'll be back in a while, you're saying, "Take a seat and look good and don't do anything else."
He's getting angry.
True, that's how shocks are happening.
I was interviewing Candice Swanepoel.
She was the best girl I ever saw in my life, but I fell in awe of divorce.
- That's what most are.
The new angels don't look like...
I remember Gisele's period...
It's hard to work with him, though.
The club came, smoked like a bet.
It's not about Tirana.
No one can't drink it, he can drink one!
Let's make the masat 'diva.
Victoria's Secret defile, published two months ago.
Why do you think?
- As I said, it's over, that legend is the time of the beautiful angels.
I'm sorry, who's going to do Gigid?
What's good?
Kendall Jenner, like...
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Kate Moss has been called the biggest name of the fashion industry.
- Yeah, but his face was beautiful.
I'd like to use my challenge right here.
I interviewed last year, and the face was a shock...
- That's all cigarettes, drink, it's ugly now.
But there was such a beautiful face in the tissues.
His lips were like Brigitte Bardot.
He reached the end of that supermodern period.
Linda Evalibista's era of Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington.
Christy was my next neighbor, and I saw it every morning.
It can't be such a thing as beauty.
What about Cara Delvingne?
- He's hurting himself.
There's no place in any camp.
It's people who're tired.
There's no food for the famous models like the past.
People like themselves want to see real faces in campaigns.
That's what we're going to do.
Because that's the train.
From the 25th to Turkey letter
According to BBC Turkish, the U.S. Department of Justice (P.E.) also wrote that the presidents of England, Galler and Scotland, were involved in the conflict between their colleagues, journalists, and journalists in Turkey.
Two attacks in Turkey, with the pressure of the coza group, were held in custody of journalists, and arrests were also counted among the journalists.

She had to respect me and my family, Charlie Hebdo, but it was exactly the opposite.
This magazine should show respect for the people who have died.
The Prophet has published unrestricted cartoons about your lord.
And they have taken over him a great deal (of punishment).
It is only a small thing for me to say about God and His Messenger.
The Kurdi, who lives in Erban, has made this call: "I call to the world and the literature of medicine, everyone who has died should respect."
They should not feel sorry for their families.
The salvation of Aylan Kurdi, who lives in Canada, was also from the career.

What are the benefits of cooking in the spring?
A technical technique that doesn't kill vitamins and minerals in the brains.
For centuries, the most popular cooking technique in the Far East has made it harder to cook, make metabolism easier.
The bacteria and germs that have completely removed the problems that have taken them all away from the middle.
The protein, like lysine, is complete with this technique, which makes the food softer.
It's done in the morning in the cold pressure, with the boobs, or through the boob of the boom machine.
In high pressure, the amount of water used in cooking and cooking is short.
The best example of this can be made with cooking in the shop.
Especially in the diet menus, the vegetables should wash the vegetables well, and then put them in the milk inside.
A deep wave will fill with water at three o'clock in the morning and will be placed inside the boom booze tube.
As soon as Tencen's mouth is closed, it's left out.
That way the boom's going to get out of the train.
The fire first produces the highest level of water, and then the fire is then taken to a low level of heat.
It's about 10 to 15 minutes of cooking vegetables and vegetables, after a good time of cooking.
The vegetables that are cooked are removed from the fire and served on the tables.
This method is healthy for the body's appearance, color, and smell in the spring.
Eating is the same thing as eating.
So the quality of the food and the taste of it will not break.
At the same time, one of the most economical cooking methods of cooking is at least the loss of food.
In the spring, the vegetables eat fresh water with alive and living things.
Especially this method of use in diets is often preferred because it is relatively light.
David Bowie - Blackstar: "son" album of space
Knowing that you're going to die, it's the last album to do it, the death bed, the quality of the clipte that you're taking...
It's like this, we can look too much for world goods.
I'm saying the world's phosphate because I'm among those who do this because I believe that the man who did it is both immortal and alien.
He came back to our world from another corner of the universe, now he's back to his mother's mother, and that's what happened.
It came because I had an inspiration to the whole world artists, not just Kiss, Marilyn Manson or Lady Gaga.
He's completed his mission.
>>uzb_Latn<< David Bowie, Blackstar, iTunes price: 9.99TL 5/5.
He probably fed him from Warhol from the same planet, Kubrick.
When Apollo 11 went to the moon, he decided to say, "I'm an alien, and he's stuck with us by saying "I'm a Space Oddy."
Actually, it didn't get confused; it's always a couple of steps ahead.
A lot of people found ways that she lost because of him.
And the musicians who listen...
If we're going to take care of plastic arts, letting her play off, it's also wrong for music.
The character of the song and the song that he wrote, sent, sentness, Tabernacle, and discography for me is an articulation.
I can understand what glam rock's father is, not himself, nor the cousin of punk.
What if I understand that antagonist's electronic movements, what about the scene he's been hiding in love since he was a child?
David Bowie reminds us of what the word means by which we've kept the word for those years.
It wasn't a man, she wasn't a woman; it wasn't "san."
It was a body.
It's been a while since we had a mission.
That body; 26" studio album "Blackstar" left the world two days after he was published.
Before the album was published, the "Blackstar" and "Lazarus" tried to introduce us to him.
We thought that he would never die, and then die, and that he would know.
One more game...
My album's message and emotions have been published a lot earlier than "Backstar" and "Lazarus" but was rewritten by "Sue" for this album, "Sue" (Ore A Seasson For Crime", "Tis A Faces With A Water A Wea".
The rest of them, so I'd like to say, "Girl Loves Me", "I'd like to say they've got a great song of Give Everying Away," and "The Days" too.
When we look at it all, it's built a very powerful music structure, but it's just a kind of inner feeling, like "Blackstar"...
There's no death nor a "holder" album...
It's just a real "son" album.
It's "The End" of a music life from the beginning.

How should you measure a half-year holiday?
How the students should evaluate their half-year vacation?
It should not be thought of as time spent on recreation, entertainment, television, and computer use.
Half-day holiday is an important opportunity for preparing for new training and keeping in mind the history of the past.
It's also an important opportunity to be creative, knowledge, experience, and hobby called free time.
Make a list of half-cost evaluations.
You do, write everything you plan, and try to apply it.
You're going to enjoy this, and you're going to enjoy a happy time.
First of all, let's talk about how to have a meaningful presentation for students who are prepared to make YGS-YYS.
Because the most common questions that we have to ask our friends who are preparing for YGS-YYS trials are in this way: "How we should evaluate this period, we should figure out a lot of questions, or do we have to solve them?"
And to answer these questions, let us write down the suggestions for those who are prepared to take the lead in a practical way.
While the testing process begins under normal circumstances, we're trying to finish it in the last 1 years, which is more effective, more efficient, and more accurate for us.
The last grade student has to work together with the school students at the same time.
The student who has completed the school has entered at least 1 tests (YGS-YYYS), and has been experimented with the same year as the teacher.
Because most graduate students and their family see 'O' as the last chance, and this brings a greater stress.
It's a study; it's always the work that the student does because he's not interested, and it's always the last thing he's always doing, but it's always a whole task for the students who've been trained, and when he's going to do it, and when he's going to do it.
Now there's a half-year holiday ahead, and we have to consider it the best way.
There must be a plan for us to run our time well.
>>uzb_Latn<< Following classes in the Third Year:
Everyone has to make a good plan for himself.
The 1.D. has to plan on what's done, what's missing; the day, the week, the week, and the 15 days.
In this period there must be repeated and the question must be analyzed.
At the same time, students who don't have much to do can solve the average 1-2 tests.
Your Excellency: Research shows that 75 percent of the people you learned were forgotten in one week, 66 percent a day, 54 per hour.
The best way to forget it is to do it again.
Students who have made a lot of mistakes in the past often need to be heavy upon their work.
Prepare a realistic budget, and schedule a day each day for daily living.
This plan will make you feel comfortable as academic and psychological.
And be careful that you make the most mistakes when you're putting them into your plan.
Because you're not going to have such a long vacation during the progress.
>>uzb_Latn<< Draw Questions:
It's very important to resolve the question until it's over again.
Because we can only see how much we're doing what we're doing, but we can see that we're getting our way through the question tool we've taken.
Don't forget to put a number of issues every day.
The number of questions you're going to make that day can change, and you can solve a lot of questions in a day, but at least when we see how much we have learned about that day, we need to do a solution.
>>uzb_Latn<< Try the tests:
Another study you're going to have to solve trials you'll have to do on your third year.
You can at least make a class trial analysis, even if you're not completely finished.
Let's say you've handled the Turkish class in a big place; 40's questions can be solved.
And, of course, keep working while you do this.
If you can solve the 40 Turkish question in the first 60 minutes, then the next goal is to solve it for less than a few minutes.
>>uzb_Latn<< Theatil and Hobi Plan:
Of course, it's not just a teaching work; you need to get a taste for a few days, get some rest and enjoy your rooms.
It will only prevent you from spending a vacation to study and your rest.
That's why you're going to have some special time in your plans.

He said these words to the sword board:
We'd like him to play games here, to be told.
But the point is not that we're coming.
There's a Turkey's the truth.
It's all shadowing all of this.
It's because of the snowmarket, it's the leader of the country.
As CHPs, wherever the terrorist comes from, we're welcome.
The terrorist is a crime of humanity and terrorists should never be forgiven.
It's done with terrorism, it's being made with information, it's made with a rhetoric.
Of course, we want to fight, we want no one's nose.
What's the difference between the pictures in Syria, Lübnan?
When they were sitting on the table, they made serious mistakes.
The blood of the blood, the tears, the whole responsibility of the dead.

CHP is the party that brings the biggest changes to this country.
We're always preparing for the fourth major revolution.
Whatever the price, we're going to bring this country to this country of freedom.
They can arrest us, take us in custody, do whatever they want, bring the freedom to this country no matter how heavy it may be.
I'm making clear to you, Davidut.
Don't hide behind the Darbe government, the man who hides his head off his head.
You gave the man who gave you a superior service medal.
What are you talking about?
It's all back to deceive the people.
Participants have another three revolutions: the establishment of the Republic of the Great Revolution; the establishment of the Great Revolution; and the end of the second revolution of the second revolution is over the first party period; 3.

At the boarding hall, members of the Peoples of the Party (PM), the central Council (MYK), and the elected members of the United States, were interested in living in the trials of the former CHP Federal Bayal.
And the Stanbul congresser went to the place where he came to settle for the Peoples, where he arrived early and went to the President's Kilicroglu.
There was also one of the discussions discussed by Yalowa International Moshem Ince's dealing with Kilichdoglu.
He explained he didn't accept himself as part of the PM.
However, the general center source came from the Ince, which was not proposed for PM membership.
"Who share this general central source of communication, that can be learned from the Italian National al al al al al al al al.can."
And you say, "How can I know what I know about two people's meeting?"
It's enough to say, "He's seen."
The sword was often used to ba-ba.
"Democracy, Diversity, and Brother Kuultata" took over the first day of the party council (PM).
He started working for the PM list after his sword speech.
While preparing a 100-dimensional key list, the current MYK members found out that he didn't want to take a place in the government, Jacob Akkaya, Sancer Ayar, who never applied to the PM, was called on by Seyhan Erdogu, who once again called the 13 MYK teams outside the PM.
A 100-digit key list with a PM key list is indicated by another one-level list.
The 21 financial consequences of the intervention of the CHP Board of Education in CHP have been determined to remove the cities on the European State Court of Human Rights and the increase of the State.

Which money you have to pay is what you have to pay for, which is the most used part of the speech.
By now, he gathered 52 quarts of 52 quarts to be an extraordinary 18-century, 53th major establishment at Ankara Arena last night.
It was high.
There were more than 15 thousand CHPs in the 12 grand hall.
But there wasn't a shock to the crowd's rights.
The most exciting moment, the daughter of Kilichdoglu's husband, Selvi sword, came into the congregation with his wife.
It's a pleasure to say, "I'm going to say good-bye," and he continued to say good-bye.
There wasn't any evidence of the AK Party meeting.
Even when the sword was spoken, there was a big move in the field of Arena.
Clearly, the CHPs who wanted to enter the Party Council chose to seek help with the party managers and journalists.
"It's better for the party parties like the Core or the Soviet Union to say, "It's better for the party to sit down like the rope and not sit."
There's another difference between the CHP board, the AK Party or the MHP board.
It's just the general presidents talking at these parties.
The CHP will turn into a platform where the party's problems are discussed.
The number of parties who wanted to talk in the United Kingdom last night had a lot of difficulty in setting up the Divan Murat Caraallic period.
In the faces and languages, there was a distance between the descriptions of the "Melekelete" and "You're going to get out of this room."
All the CHPs said "to do something" but they didn't have a strong and powerful answer to the question "what to do."
There was a big effect that there would have been no choice in the next four years.
When we were on the sword line, we'd expect journalists to answer the question "What to do."
The sword man answered his question first.
The arrest journalists paid attention to the matter of the report, for those who live in the South, who live in a foreign policy.
He has a long time-term response to the "neutral effects" of the party with CHP.
And when he came to "what he should do," he tried to show "straj" instead of talking about cold steps.
He pointed out that all these problems could come with more justice than a powerful democracy.
He made a promise to CHP and said, "No matter what happens to the democracy, we're going to work for whatever price.
He said, "We'll fight for death for democracy."
One last note is to remind you that CHP has been able to deal with the issue of "organization" by the 53th institution of CHP, and now it's possible to be able to gather without problems.
By the way, there was a card for 900 journalists who said they were gonna follow the board, but the newspaper was not at that level.
He wasn't as eager to follow the AK Party Board of Media Councils.

FedEx's income is complicated in 2016
FedEx reported the results for three months, and the demand for carbohydrates, increased demand for carbohydrates, and reduced the cost of the demand for land services.
The company also said you planned to get about 555,000 season workers for the holidays.
Last year, FedEx was told that he would have a 500,000 season workers for the vacation.
On Wednesday morning, the opening opening was nearly 2.5% in the previous operations.
FedEx Corp said he was expected to pay $1040 in the next May, $10.90 in the next month, and the previous estimate was 20 cents.
Analists were expected to pay $10.84 for research by FactSet.
The average rate of averages in January 4 is likely to be equal to 4.9% high speeds in the snowship of large packages or large packages.
According to the company's claim that the prices are higher and higher than the growth of the economy are still expected to be higher than the previous year.
President and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "has shown a strong performance despite the poor economic conditions waiting for the global trade and the global economy."
Tatil intelligence plans were announced one day after the cancer firm UPS, so the UPS decided to take 900,000 extra workers in the same year.
At the end of August 31th, FedEEx increased its income by 6% as a year ago.
The amount of money was estimated by Zacks Yatrim Research was estimated to be $2.442 per cent of the 12 mainlist's estimates.
It's up to $123 billion.
The six analytics that were seen by Zacks were waiting for $1.23 billion.
FedEx took over the recent year, which led to the rise of the Express unit.
However, the explosion in the field increased the results of the FedEx Earth's services.
In the last quarter, the local services increased 229%, but the production cost was based on the high cost of large packages and the high cost of insurance.
While the high-economies were coming in high-speed jobs, the extraress went high because of their high pressure rates.
About an hour before the opening was opened, the FedEx shares were returned to $1,5%, or $15.5 per hour.
On Tuesday, 11% and 11% of the record level in June were shut down by 17%.
During the most unexpected meetings, the Federal Rezerv politicians decided that this week, spending 27 percent of his days around a H chat table, almost 10 years with interest rates.
The two double-party meeting room in a central bank will be held by the United States' wall.
The map manager Janet L. Yellen and colleagues have been in contact with the economic interests of the nation.
There are two tasks that the Central Bank has taken from Congress: to take the U.S. economy to the highest level, and to support the prices here.
But since the Great Buhran, Fed has admitted that there is a third case that has been not written: Mali equation.
And the third case may be an X factor that will be heard on Thursday, that the United States economy will be able to be able to determine if it has been ready to end the relatively short period of time from the end of 2008 to the end of the short-term financial period.
Although most data economy grew in a good way, the final game in global financial markets can now be said to be a threat to adding attention to Fed officers, reference fundings, less than one percent of the population.
"The opening is going to be the first and most important thing they watch, and the most important thing they'll ever do" was Steve Nikolaus & Co's chief economist Lindsay M. Piegza said.
He said, "But if they're looking for an excuse to increase the area, I think they're going to have enough to wait for the global market for a little longer."
There's no ideas about what Fed will do, and it allows them to make fun of their financial markets.
About half of Bloomberg's economists had been waiting for a percentage of interest this week.
However, financing companies expect Fed to stay with a mother who is only about 30 percent of an increase in progress.
In the case of this situation, when Fed's increase rates, political producers may not be able to reduce the effect that they can have on another step.
On Tuesday, Dow Jones' indexed 228.89 points or 1.599.85.
Moody's Capital Markets Research Group economist John Lonski said, "The Fed policy makers were expected to hold their position this week."
He said, "It would be surprising that Fed's increase rates now."
If the Fed managers were to decide this way, they would have to take a long year to calm the financial markets so they can't.
The other experts suggested that Fed could keep the financial markets from getting out of the way he's going to move.
Just a month ago, Fed seemed to be on the way to increase this month, which was a small step to slow the money conditions, which strengthened the United States' growth.
Yellen said that despite complaints about the need for a more economic process, the liberals expect this year's average rate in spring months and summer.
Despite the speed of production in August, the growth in the business market has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate last month has dropped to 5.1% of the lowest level since seven years, and Fed has reached the level of total consumption.
The pay rate has shown to be improved.
And despite the annual average banking rate of 2%, Fed politicians said it was an important reason to reduce oil prices.
Pantheon Macroeconomics chief economists Ian Shepherdson said that economics can deal with high rates and may need this in the business market."
But last month of the world's financial markets began to undermine China's money unit.
Dow Jones' indexed the art of art, fearing that investors could slow down the global growth of a Chinese economy.
When Dow was nearly 10% of the highest level in May, he suddenly jumped back.
Fed's marketing for political producers is more complicated than the time when the interest rate will increase.
The UCLA Ziman Center for the Real Estate and former Fed officer Stephen D. Oliver said that for a few weeks, there may be some controversy regarding the financial markets of China and the lack of information about economic corruption."
Now they're going to expect at least one month to manage these effects better.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about the effects of the U.S. economy, and there are almost no data in China to rely on the future of progress" Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the primary concerns of Fed, so technically technically it should not be the same.
However, Fed actually became the paradox of the world.
The effect of the Central Bank has been great in recent years.
Until then, President Ben S. Bernanke was called "the paradigm of Fed's worldwide political movements" in 2013.
In a world where markets and economies come together, Fed may not only follow the progresss in other areas but also speak to other central bank managers and students to read the global economy better.
The executive firm of the government said that Envestnet Inc.'s global strategy process is "a lot of talent" for the decision maker Zachary Karabell.
The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va. Jeffrey Lacker said this month, "Fed's reaction to financial movements that are not connected to economic basiss."
The political producer was a member of the Federal Open Policy Committee and a member of the vote, for example, making 1998-99 decisions.
"In spite of limited definitions for the U.S. growth of the United States," said Lacker, "the financial crisis in Asia has led to an increase of 0.5% on three meetings in Asia."
One year later, the Fed officers took these cuts back.
Adam S. Pose, a former member of the British Central Bank, said, "Fed, 2008 marketing concerns should be put in front of the big crisis."
The last player said he couldn't reach this level.
You don't really want to be afraid of going to a restaurant because the market was low, and Peterson said that the International Economics Institute was President Psen.
The Central Bank is still having two officials and not talking about the financial balance, and I don't think it's supposed to be a move until it's changed.

The wedding is closing up with Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, the Today Center for Sunrice's 33,000 numbers was 318.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000.
It's a total of 349,000 against Today's 34,000 numbers in September.
This is the most interesting thing that happens in the whole morning.
The change of the winds affect the air from the parliament this morning!

They think they're Bekar Sam Wood's perfect man -- but who's that?
Did the secret come in?
Lana Jevons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Marcoski may have found out who would win the Bekar without knowing who.
The woman who picked up Sam Wood at the end of the Bekar program was in a big secret.
And the other three girls are doing their best to tell who the last rose area is.
But the day before the three of them hit two, Lana Jevons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markkosky, they may have given a clue without knowing who the winner was.
Sam Wood has sealed his mouth on Thursday.

They feel very good and comfortable when they're close to each other.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood's gonna be a couple who are very well aware of him.
Mackay said last week's visit date would make him think Wood was a "right person."
"When I saw him with my friends and my family, I realized that this wasn't exactly a game - I'm completely connected to him."
If it wasn't for him, it was mysterious when Wood was asked who could choose.
He said, "I don't know if I can say that."
"I love the girls in equal terms - Snezana and Lana are equal."
The Bachelor is broadcasting Wednesday, Wednesday, 19.30.
First edition: Is Sam Wood the best option for Sarah?
There's been different options from where Jarryd Hayne started the NFL career.
After Detroit and Seattle moved to the United States, they took a lot of interest in him, and after the most of the other teams were drawn to him last year.
However, Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and it seems like a wise decision.
Some soldiers sat on Hayne because he lost his lose in Australia's ragbian performance on Tuesday, as on Tuesday, against Minnesota.
But Tomsula believed this man and gave him another opportunity to get to Hayne, and he was given a game after Reggie Bush's recovery.
After Tomsula's play, he continued to show the real color in his dressing room.
Instead of lowering the flowers in front of the whole team, he encouraged them.
Tomsu was also supporting Hayne at the next press conference.
Cam Inman, a member of the 49ers team, said that he was also encouraged by Hayne's special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey and was advised to forget the next game thinking.
Jarryd Hayne, the first quarter of Minesoa Vikings, and the ball broke.
It wasn't what Hayne and his large Australian fan film was dreaming for the first game in NFL.
Hayne was seen on the scene when she was released from the field, and then the Australian radio doubles Hamish and Andy told her that 2DayFM 10.1 would not be a bad start for the NFL career.
Hayne said, "It's just one of those things, you're sorry for the next game, and that's it."
Hayne also reminded me of the 2007 Origin first game of the game, with the back of Queensland.
Still, this has been a great experience for the 27-year-old player.
Hayne was released in Instagram, while the game was held on the board after the game.

In Nepal, Police' Prostoxists have died 4 dead
On Wednesday, a officer reported that the police who had taken action against the new constitution in the country had killed four men, including a 4-year-old boy.
The scene was in the city of Rupaldehi, the capital of Katmandu, 175 miles west of Katmandu.
The district officials said that Bishop Prasad Dhakal had gathered outside a police station from 1000, and some of them threw stones and fire bombers.
Mr. Dhakal said before using plastic bullets, the police used a biscuit gas and fire fire.
He said twenty police and five civilians were wounded.
It's known that he was killed, but it is not clear why plastic bulletes are often used to produce such a high-breast case.
The conflict has often been the last of the violent Protestants who have been working on the South level for weeks, and it has suggested that the members of the Madhesian ethnic group will see their political effects.
The ethnic Tharus group who wanted to set up their own countries is also making protests in West Nepal.
On August 10, 10th, he killed 11 at least 40 people to be the police officer.
In this period, four major political parties agreed to divide the country into regions—and it is also considered an important step to prepare a new constitution in Nepal for the centuries.
The research on a new constitution has been continuing since 2008, but lawmakers have been able to speed up this period after a devastating earthquake that caused thousands of people to die in April.
The law makers worked on the constitutional authorities this week in Katmandu and the authorities said that the new text will be organized on Sunday.

Google launched a campaign for collecting 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc (GOGOL.O) heard a combination of $1 million who wanted to gather a total of thousands of refugees who had been injured from war and had to flee to Europe.
Google announced an unsatisfactory connection to an unsatisfactory private approach in his blog.
Rather than making this explanation; when he was seven years old, Rita Masouud, who was a Google employee who escaped from Cain, wrote his personal experience.
"In our age, hunger, thirst, cold, and fear have many dark buss and train passengers."
I was lucky.
However, since the existence of the refugees and ethnic crisis in Europe grew up, many families, like my family, are in need of help.
The victims will go to the four-five organizations that have no support for refugees and refugees: the United Kingdom Committee, the rescue of the children, and the United Nations.
Google said the first $11 million is going to match the google.com/refugeerief's address.
Europe, confronts the worst crisis since World War 2. This is the most important reason why it's been the four-year-old, the four-year-old Suriya war.
Many of the wars have escaped Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, and Libya.

In high-bobiasc disease, weight loss may help surgery
A new research suggests that the benefits of obesity surgery in 2 diabetes are at least five years ago.
But it's early to tell the patients who have a high obesity obesity in the middle of obesity that they don't live longer than they do.
According to Dr. Robin Blackstone, who wrote on the JAMA surgery, and had written an article on the obesity surgery.
The weight loss surgery, with the other name, uses a barbaric surgeon to reduce the size of the stomach.
This reduces the hunger and reduces the ability of the body's blood vessels.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been confirmed that 2 diabetes has been affected by 2 diabetes, but many studies have been done on body mass index (VKI), 35 or higher obese individuals.
The BMI, which is measured by the size of the weight rate, will be adopted between 18.5 and 24.9.
25 or 2 BMI shows that there are a lot of weights, and 30 BMI is considered to be equal to obesity.
>>uzb_Latn<< You can count from this link: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In the new research, Taiwan's full-five Min-Sheng hospital, has been using two different barbaric surgeons - gastric Christs and bacteria - compared to the treatment of patients since 2007.
By the end of the study, the average surgery was back from the end of the fifth century BMI to 24.5.
It's possible that the BMI's on the 29th of those who have experienced surgery from surgery.
Diabetes, 36 percent of the surgery was completely solved by 28 percent.
In a group of medical ways, it has been resolved only to be complete in %1 and only 2 percent.
Also, according to writers, blood pressure control, triglyserids, and "facted" LDL corteosterol was usually better at the "crehy treatment group".
Researchers have also seen the blood levels of A1c hemoglobin from the side of blood sugar in patients.
According to researchers, A1c hemoglobin is best held under 7%.
The post-operative A1c hemoglobin is approximately 6 percent.
In the group of medical treatment, about 8% remain constant.
However, with the levels of A1c hemoglobin, this is a better "glysemic control", Dr. Chih-Chang Hsu and team members of the study did not limit the mortality rate for five years.
The research team compared the findings with these two operations.
A1c hemoglobin (7.5 kg) was discovered in the fifth century (7.4 kg) and the A1c hemoglobin (7.51 kg) was discovered to be higher than any of its teeth.
Although the study did not say that surgery will continue after the end of the five years, Arizona explained that medical College-Phoenix was the same as Dr. Blackstone, who spent the life of surgery in a larger population in Sweden.
In this study, another group of obesity patients who have seen bariatric surgeon have experienced a greater risk of death in 15 years.
This situation is a safe discovery for people under Blackstone and BMI 35.
This is the most effective part of the article, because in a BMI low, there is no increase in death or cancer disorders.
Blackstone added that people and doctors should take seriously the issue of getting weights under the BMI's BMI at the bottom of the 27th.
I think we've waited enough for people to take this matter seriously.
I think it's really hard to change this genetic change in the tissues that are associated with obesity and diabetes.
"They're impossible to come to Europe" - Daai Lama - RT News
Dalai Lama, who says he can't have the house to all refugees, added that the real solution was in the Middle East.
Tibet Buddhist leader has been called to end violence in the countries of the refugees.

In his speech, he said, "Every man is impossible to come to Europe."
Dalai Lama just asked for a temporary analysis of all Germany and Austria's efforts to cope with crisis.
"It's great to take care of a few thousand refugees, but you also have to think about long-term solutions; you must understand how you can bring a lasting peace and permanent peace of mind in the countries, based on the basis of their education."
We need to think about how we're gonna reduce the deaths in our country.
We have to reduce power use.
Power use has never been a solution to problems."
During the war, Dalai Lama said that George Bush was doing what they were doing on 11 September, and that the United States began to start the chain of events that could not be controlled by violence.
In my letter to President Bush, on September 11, I sent my head to the President Bush, and I explained that this problem is not a violent way to solve violence.
I know your dreams are good, but he used power and caused unexpected results," Dalei Lama said.

He could have been killed for my kid.
Lopez urged parents and teachers to use alcoholless products or take off the contact with the antiseptic medieval maladies with their children who could not reach their children’s contact with them.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some antiseptics have been associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario were killed because of swallowing an antiseptic that was not explained in its name.
The health authorities suggested that the matter is not as meat alcohol as it is listed in the list, but it is possible to have a medicinal effect that can have a fatal effect.
In January, the fourth grade student in New York, three of the former students, according to the police report, was designed to "supervise" students into poisoning them with anti bacterial products.
The teacher prohibited the use of alcohol because he was extremely allergic to the antiseptic.
The police suggested that this plan would be "a disaster of the bomb."

Putin, he's ingesting you.
Russia has told Turkey that while Turkey can't deal with Turkey's turkey's services, Russia has not given the State status "Russia with Russia" and the Russian Commissions have not given up to Turkey."
Russia's Economic Development Department, a new "Susnai conditions" on Russia's government, hoping that the entire economy will bring itself to Russia.
While Russia's Federal Administration's service is being published in the federal directory, Turkish companies and firms are expected to be allowed to work with Russia.
In spite of the lack of access to other sources from Turkey or the local production in Russia, Turkish companies and firms can benefit from their products and services.
This category will determine which Turkish property and service will be included in Russia's Economic Development Committee, which will be established by the Ministry of Economics.
Thus, the Turkish company can be bound by the bureaucrats that can work with Russia.
At the same time, private companies in Russia will need to prove that they're not responsible for what they're gonna do with Turkish partners.
It will also be created in Russia by the Russian government to be approved by the Russian government.
The Russian Tur Operators announced last night that Russian citizens didn't give up Turkey.
"There was an order of the State of Transportation and the Russian Foreign Minister's advice to go to Turkey, but our citizens began to search for the form of order to organize their holidays alone."
On the Internet, social networks grow up as the most practical and cheapest way to make vacation in Turkey.
The most popular suggestion is to make a hotel reservation online and fly with THY.
Russia Prime Minister Dmitrity Medvevev identified the oil prices under 30 dollars as "dramatic" in Russia.
"No one thought that the oil would fall into $30, but it was a very bad surprise for our government.
He said, "It seems that the budget would not be able to carry out the current situation."
Last month we left behind, 2015.
Following the flight crisis, the Russian government President Vladimir Putin announced that the economy will be more deeply affected.
During those days, our staff who tried to get used to Russia have been driving on the streets of THY.
Turk's property is being driven in the winds, of course it's bound to be unsatisfactory.
It's over a month, and last month it's announced by Nerdin Hacikou.
That's what I'm doing.
But why?
It's very simple.
You're no longer trying to close the political gates of the economy with such a globalization of the economy.
Look, we're still going to write news about how the economy's already applied for Iran and for years.
It seems like a friend of Russia and Turkey, but the two neighbor countries who don't have a lot of neighbors, really need each other.
It's not possible for you to get away with these two countries with a tourist who interacts with his client in such a night.
If you close the doors, the people of these two countries get into each other's country.
It's the best thing to do without creating the new Reza Zarrabs (Rza Sarraf) and count there.
Before we get the economy back...

During the battle of the hearts, the SFA's punishment and the presentation of his team to Neilson, against Warburton's self-conceited signing.

Now we want to show ourselves as soon as possible.
I know that the situation is very sad and that many people are angry or sad.
We're in the same situation - but we have to keep going.
We really really need Celitic's support because it makes them feel better.
Now it's important to stay together.
The shyness of Warburton's January transfer
Just a few weeks ago, some January-translation goals have been identified, but the boss of Rangers is afraid of Mark Warburton's signing, when Ibrox refuses to break the team.
The old Brentford teacher said, "It's very different from the window of the ocean."
For the players who write, there's a season you're going to buy them, and we've seen this season in our own group.
The team's really good.
Sometimes it's more harmful to add unnecessary players to what you really need.
He's targeting Celitic Michelu in his retirement
The Swansea bonded with Michu transfer in the window, and his agreement with Celitic was in vain when he finished his agreement with the Knews.

Why I'm a Witness in Oklahoma?
I'm going to watch a man's murder because of a late legal case today.
I hope not, but I'm going to sit down with Richard Glossypic in watching the death room at the Oklahoma State Hospital.
He wanted me to be one of four official Witnesses of his death.
The invitation was first made in January with his best friend, and I was shocked, no matter how shocked I was.
I'm afraid of that.
So why am I doing this?
I accepted because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story about a death sentence.
He'll offer a unique perpendicular perspective.
True, journalists are allowed to watch the executions in America, and since they are more likely to apply than they are, it seems a horrible piano.
Oklahoma dropped the media seats at 12.
Whoever's chosen, he'll be watching his feelings.
I can't do that.
I'm sitting next to Richard Glosspi's best friends, and for the past two and a half hours, I developed a relationship with him.
I love that man.
We often laugh when we talk.
The authorities in prison said I'm not going to be a witness and a journalist, so I'm not going to be a pen and paper to record what I've seen.
I'll try to remember all the details.
A newspaper in Oklahoma accused me of showing my independence from me.
Here's class.
Tell the prisoner's story as he likes, win.
I complained about him.
He also admitted that he could make it a better wish, but he thinks I'm still wrong.
Richard Glosspi, I'm saying, and some things I'm writing don't agree with me.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't have accepted it if he did.
I told him he could get me out of the witness list.
But a international reporter wants to be there and write it down.
If he dies, he thinks it will help the public to act against the death penalty.
A reporter from Huffington Post, Kim Bellware will be with me.
If you want to know more about this, please listen to the podcasts I've prepared.
I'm not going to tell you all the details here.
I have no idea what Richard Glosspi is innocent.
Barry Van Treese's death is enough to make him a partner.
But I still believe he's not guilty of murder.
I believe there's no proof that there's no proof of a death sentence.
I think his execution was wrong.
And I'm going to watch her death with this perspective.
I can't really claim I'm going to be a observatory.
You can look at the other reporters there.
You're going to be taken from me, watching you watch the death of a man who loved death without reason.
After the Soviet police chase, the man was convinced of Canin's River
The Canning Vale police officer is dead while he's convinced the man of Canin's River.
The claim to escape from a police car behind Perth ended up with an effort to convince a police officer "to convince him to come back to the shore slowly.
The Canning Vale police was called because of the lack of access to Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, the man tried to get into the River of Caning.
But he didn't get too far.
"Grandell Castleney is staying in her water, and I'm not going out, I'm going to get me."
The police didn't want to miss the Lachlan Perhavec uniform and used a more safe tactic -- "The police interview."
"People sometimes call it funny to try to escape."
The champ player Ben Cousins provides a permanent example of survival in mind.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid alcohol control and tried to swim up Swan River.
He failed his efforts, but he was inspired by the fact that the local people had planned a joke Ben Cousins biotechnology.
Peter Moody claimed that the heroes were defeated and threatened to leave the race.
Peter Moody argued that Ricing Victoria was trying to build a place in his own cave last year and threatened to leave her.
Ricing reached Victoria's heroes and units, and their final meal, they said they took up a personal campaign against Lady Tatai to abandon Lady Tatai on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax that he was always trying to do the best for Media, and told Lidari that he could not explain himself in the circumstances where he could not explain himself.
He said he didn't want to look like a drunk grapes for 18 months.
"I wasn't going to say these things, and I've been going through a long time, but sometimes you're very angry and everything's going to happen." Moody said.
They know it's going on.
Sometimes you're reacting, and you're going to have his results, and I'm going to get the results of what I'm saying.
When I go home tonight, I'm gonna sleep.
I want to walk up and my boss know that I'm trying to do the best I can for them.
When they start thinking that I didn't do this, I shouldn't be an engineer anymore.
I'd think I'd do what I'd do with my license.
Before, Moody launched a bomb that accused the union department in his report to be in his own hands.
"On eight months ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown, and Dr Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man who asked me if I had told them what I was doing in my dreams," said Moody, Racing.com.
They're clearly convinced that I'm a rival.
If that's the case, they've got to return all of them because they weren't capable enough to catch me.
Robert Rouston, former president of RVL's new president, David Moodie and RVL, they knew that now.
Does that make me think it's starting to become a personal person?
RVL's got a series of balls, and maybe anyone else wants to be responsible for what's going on in the industrial?
Am I bad for industrial?
Am I so bad for the industrial?
Maybe the people outside think I'm them.
Maybe they need to buy my license and throw me out, but I'm not sure what I'm saying.
But at the point of my coming, I don't want anything, and it hurts me.
That really hurts me.
I will make them under pressure, and I will carry responsibility for them to make decisions.
I have my family's support and I'll walk.
The disappointment that the Runer had taken Lidari into him for a long time, and the disappointment that he had lived in the drawing scene, led him to say, "Put my license behind the table."
The unsatisfactory champion, who won the Moody race, said he was "grandy" the rules of the village or locker to the horse's feet.
That's against the race rules.
I must take all responsibility for this."
One of my men took the mud into his feet by mistake.
He could have taken it last night.
He could have taken it yesterday, so did.
He took a race day.
Moody, because of the investigation that the managers have opened, they may be able to face the punishment for taking three months for a race day.
It's a joke.
Those who follow these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We know we need rules, but it's gone too far." Moody said.
In Cebram, the driver was arrested.
The police arrested the guy who hit a bicycle at Cobram last weekend.
Bicycle was removed from the Royal Melbourne Hospital after a car hit him on Saturday morning in Murray Valley.

Melbourne Stormator Craig Bellamy answered his claims about the noise
Melbourne Storm trainer Craig Bellamy's efforts to "play" for two percent of NRL's team teams.
Sydney Roosters trainer Trent Robinson Friday night said that he would allow the two finals in Sydney to "go" with his own team of judges.
Brisbane Brancos artist Wayne Bennett won a half-five match against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, and he said he was a "respiratory" game, which was not too large for two o'clock.
Bellamy defends the team and said they were just focusing on "the Thomas" while fighting.
Bellamy said that it's because he's worried that Storm's worried that he'd get power from the two pre-government teams who came to the two pre-century wards.
It's moving -- I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about the noise on Saturday.
I guarantee we've never changed anything in our defense systems or technology, but in the last six weeks, we've just done a real shot of our contact with our contacts, and it's a step forward for us.
There's been a great team that has been doing for three years, and it's not unusual for him to lose a small shock.
It's also funny this year's time.
Bellamy's opinion against Bennett's "heavy football", reminds Bennett of Bennett's 2010 St. George-Illawarra Dragons's role as a football player.
Wayne's talking about the exciting football.
On Saturday night with his own games, Bellamy told us how exciting their game was and their game was."
I remember St George's being a boring team in 2010, and Wayne said he wouldn't even give a rat ass.
But now there's a team that we can say exciting football and, especially young companions.
This is a football you'd like to play when you have these kind of players.
In 2010, everyone wants to play this point, and now everyone wants to play football - no teams such as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they don't have half (i.e.
This gives me more confidence, because they're talking because they're afraid they're playing.
When they went to the big games, they probably wouldn't bring us into their minds six weeks ago.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game of Storm and Roosters had a higher score than Brocos and Cowboys.
The broncos game was probably a good game, but what was the scour? 16-12?
Our game's 20 to 18, but that's exciting football?
Or would it be exciting to cut off the horses, but don't do the scorings?
That's my day.
If they're talking about us, it means we'll meet them here in the next stage.
Storm, North Queensland Cowboys, or Cronulla Sharks, won the first final game on Saturday night because they won the AAMI Park in the first game for sale.
The Serbian man was released for a drug charge.

Arsenal Captain Michel Artata says that Willshere was having problems with his teams before his game of Diamo Zagreb
Wenger suggested that Willshere's illness was in September and that his treatment was planned, and he didn't play in Christmas.
The best scenario already means that Willshere is going to be the most complete match in England, and it is clear that he will not join the European Champion in the next summer.
The most embarrassing part of the last problem is that Wishere has finished a separate leg, and then she's looking for the oldness of the season before the season.
This kind of disease career isn't threatening, Wenger.
It's a complete bone.
It's nothing big.
It was just an accident.
This has no connection to the known or previous diseases.
According to a medical perspective, these could be true, but there is also the danger of being more careful to prevent a player who will be accepted in the middle of the season.
There's also a disturbing state of development.
According to research by Principal Creator Ltd, Wishere's loss has been 23 different cases since the beginning six years ago.
In the last five season, Arsenal's 157 lig match game only played 65.
In the big picture, Arsenal is one of the two first League teams that most often lost from eight seasonals.
Wengger accepts a fellow-in-law, but Arsenal believes he's going to recover during the recovery season last season.
He said, "It's a period of a time when you're going back from a disease, you're going to have a chance of getting your body strong and fighting," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get out of this.
I don't hope that the body is capable, I trust it, and I believe you'll make the career that he deserves.
He's got the Tottenham Hotpur games that will play in front of the Armoo Zagreb on Wednesday night, which will start in front of Dinamo Zagreb.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey are not going to Croatia.
Wenger can start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivia Giroduud instead of Nacho Monreal.
"I'm trying to protect the world and give the players what they need," he said.
Despite Arsenal's open favorites of the F Group, the maximum stadium in Zagreb is located among Europe's most shyest stadiums.
The dinamo season is not new after creating its own "Namagulp" campaign.
Stadium Tuesday night was covered with a earthquake of 3.2 violent earthquake, according to Richter scale.
This was the 10th earthquake in Zagreb this year.
Wenger Arsenal's recent season believes that he has received the essential lesson for defeating Monaco on the League of League, and the club continues to be moteled with the goal of bringing the first European Cup victory.
"It's a motivation case," he says.
It never happened in Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but I have enough experience from the other side.
We're jealous, but we're not a ghost.
FriendsFest: a comedy program that teaches us a lot about friendship.
The lack of similar ports in programs is remarkable, especially in the case of young men, and in the age of 15 years of suicide rates.
In 2013 this was the biggest cause of the deaths of men between 20-45 years of age, and more than three times compared to women.
To focus on this problem, Seffil Life Review announced 2015 as a male Year and encouraged the country to oppose the country that men want help when they need it.
There's a friendship in the center of the struggle to fulfill this difficult mission.
A study between more than 22,000 high school students showed this difficulty showed that if a person who had a high-level "in" friend was in high fashion, he had a chance to improve his chances of recovery.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, a plant that can produce mental health problems that can produce mental health problems.
Of course, friendship must be met first.
In this area of social media, it is more likely to respond to an emergency rather than an incorporating conversation.
Our digital lives double the need to look like strong, strong, happy, and successful people; even if everything's adhesive.
The concepts that come to the level of phosphorylation psychologists called external value; money, immunization, social status; these are under the influence of internal, mental health, and the amount of alcohol that affects our physical health.
As millions of video games recently explained, money will not buy more happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was to turn this focus down.
The characters were not known by their actions, but they were familiar with their personality, and they put it in conversation with their friends.
Joy and Chandler's frequent hugs, many minutes they're watching football in the convergence chairs, and they've all come back to Rachel, even though they know that they can communicate with them in a way that they can communicate with them.
A help worker told me, "I've seen how your little companion can make the difference between friends."
Most of the men we've been talking to can't talk to their friends.
It's a feeling like "go and go," and it's the idea that it's a weakness to open up to others.
It's one of the programs I've come to think of as a long-term development mechanism.
He's been struck by little moments of your boyfriend's friendship.
My goal is to help people when they're in trouble with a foreign status on the phone, but long-term support comes from family and friends with long-term support.
And if you're going to join the FriendsFest at Comedy Center this weekend, why don't you take your friends to Central Park for a drink at this beautiful setting of scenes?
Or better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You don't know what a difference your friendship will make.
Friends, comedy Central -- all 236 chapters are published for FriendsFest
Di Maria made it easier for the PSG to defeat Malmö
Angel Di Maria, after his golf to Malmö, Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani.
Angel Di Maria made it easier for the Swedish team to fight for Malmö at the beginning of the Olympics League.
Here's the game report and the match.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani began a very comfortable and comfortable victory on Tuesday of the Paris Saint-Germain against the Olympics League.
Di Maria became a PSG player who helped keep the French champion on the way to the League, but at 61 minutes, Cavani was unable to count the opportunities to take advantage of Cavani's hair.
He needed a powerful start in Paris with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, not only to get rid of the Swedish bands, but to improve in the final three champions.
But the game they played wasn't the best game for Laurent Blanc's team, and Zlatan spent a lot of position in the area of the crime scene, and then was taken away by the company that began with him in 1999.
"It's not easy to get out of the classroom in Ligis, it's not easy to get out of this care for our opponents, and it's a good start to get better in the season, even if we need to get better." Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win, even though we didn't have any more hands, and we won.
After Abrahamic illness, he returned to Paris team with one of the three players who had been playing for the last week with Bordeaux last week, but in the fourth minute, he was in the shadow of Dia Maria.
When the Argentine Canal player was transferred from Manchester Uniteded last month, PSG was considered to be a player in Europe who ran back to the Malmötti's capital, and showed John Wandland that it was not right to take part of him.
But everybody was disappointed that PSG would win a great victory.
To get to this tour, Malmö, who got Celtilic's nine international players on the beach, had two players, a five men's grandfather and a middle-ager.
In the 34th minute, Nicholas Djjurdjic's scar of the corner protected by Kevin Trep made a little few.
Without the other side, PSG allowed them to slow down the game with unsatisfactory lines, and in the first half, Abrahamovic couldn't do at least five steps, and then the second half started to make a dream of Canoni's game.
However, when he came to organize his business associates, he showed that he was more master, and in 52 minutes, he gave Abraham the son of Abraham who sent him to Willand's castle in 52 minutes.
After the second match was filled with Cavani, the Uruuyian player recorded the sixth hand from Abrahammokovic's left wing.
With Malmö's plans to return, and after the defeat of Ezequiel Lavezzi, who later went into the game, has been released in the empty position of David Louise, and won't let the scoring change.
The Malmö trainer admitted that he was superior to a classic team of Age Haride PSG, and Norwegian said, "Our last champions were on the December of the year."
From that time on, we only played a ball in Swedish League where there was not only the same level.
The teams aren't enough.
It's a hat to Paris.
It was a great game for them.
Two billion dollars of glencore sales were paid for
Swiss-based mining department Glencore has paid $2.5 billion on Wednesday to sell their shares on Saturday, including the work prices left behind.

Matt Damon seems to have no importance on the film.
Matt Damon said it wasn't necessary to be behind the camera during a variety of discussions, and African-American film producer Effie Brown was opposed to her.
In HBO, the Project Greenlight Monday night, Brown cut off the experimenter's alternative approach to the political character in the selection of the project.
Damon, when we're talking about various kinds of things, you're doing this at the player's player's car, not the player's.
"All of us," said Brown, the actor of the Martian film, who continued to say, "All of us, yes, yes."
To discuss the finalists of Damon and Brown, partners were brought together by the Affleck and Farrelly brothers.
"I wanted to think about how to treat everyone who is the director of the government," Brown said.
The only black character is a woman who shot by a white chattel.
The men of our dear white people insisted that Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio, who were willing to run the film, would have responded to the terms of "if we didn't want it."
After the discussion was published, there was a lack of joy in social media to Damon's comment.
"When Matt Damon spoke to the only black person in the room, he said he was angry that he could explain his differences to this person," he said.
After the Tweet was sent, he received 5,000 reweets and 400,000 approvals.
Damon's comments came from the front of social debate in the media.
After Michael Brown was killed by a young white police officer named Michael Brown in 2014, the political life is important.
During February, singer Principal Prince spoke on the move while Grammy Awards were recognized by the New Year's album Island.
The albums are still important.
The albums, like books and blacks, are still important.
Soon, the leaders of the Black Life announced that it was not necessary for Elizabeth Hassebeck to be considered an important witness in Fox News.
Leaders said it is important to live a black life, a love group.
Earlier, Damon had been reported to have received an invitation to visit the Catholic Church in West, including artists, artists, and media bosss.
It's not clear that he hasn't accepted the invitation or met the Pope yet.
'The American Ninja warrior wore his first champion.'
Professor Daac Caldierro, who won the American Ninja Warman program on Monday night.
This contest that entered the 7th season has not seen a raceman who can finish all the obstacles in the park.
In the Greek final, Caladierro and Geoff managed to stay in the final round of Britten.
The last mission was about 20 meters away in 30 seconds.
Brittten was the first person to finish this park, and so he managed to finish the American Ninja War, which was hardly easy, but Catilero finished this park three seconds ago.
After this hard victory, Catalero spoke to E!
"I think I've won more than $10,000 a year, or more than $0,000 a year," he said.
I mean, I don't think it's gonna be... I can't imagine how it's going to be.
He met with Kent Weed de The Hollywood Reporter and explained why he would not receive any reward even if he was the first contester who finished Britten.
According to the rules, the money will be given to the fastest.
Weed said, "If anyone finishs more than one, he'll win the fastest reward."
Although money was a great reward and changed life, he won a great career.
I don't think that's a bad idea about it.
He's so happy he did what he did.
She's got a lot of praise from her fans.
He's a great man and a family father.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff told me, "If someone's going to beat me, I'm glad that it's Isaac."
I think Isaac would have thought the same thing if they had changed.
The American Ninja Warman renews a contract for the eighth season, and the shootings will start in Bahar in 2016.

This was the first three shots that Martinez won against Seattle Mariners on the 6th.

Well, it looked good (in the case of a BP) and it was much better to look at BP than it was still in play.
He finally got the best chance to get back to the game of Twins, who finally got three neighbors at the end of the seventh battle.

The minyat bag is now a very fashion-Zaman Gazette E.
There's a way around the fashion world, and it's going back to the bags.
In recent years, the light of the world has been...
It's possible to tell you that the small bags that are attached to adults are too careful.
They say it's nice that everything's small.
I think that's true for the bags.
At least the wind began to rise in the opposite direction, and the bags were almost no longer filled with bags of bags.
There were little bags already, but this time the big arm bags were in our way against us.
Your phone, your credit card, and your key can be broken.
The white brother who started with Céline and Hermès was spreading with Prada.
It's also influenced by the new models of the bag's admirer's curiosity.
Loweewe offered the fun bags that he had prepared for this season.
In Panda, the box bear, and the fleet of the fleets from the fleets.
It seems that the large bags of laxes are filled with fenomen names again with the most red-brown names.
Hermes' "one man" who's ready to accuse Jane Birkkin is one of the most preferable ones.
But Jane Birkin said she didn't want her name to remember with a briefcase, but she's taking it in her memory now.
The modal weeks have made me feel that the van flows.
The podiums are going ahead of mediums.
You can't wear them because they're quite tiny.
They can be used as a wide range of bits.
But in the politicians, we've seen those long legs, the fingers of the models.
Fundy is those who carry the mini bags to a point.
There's a suggestion of those who don't fall in the van, but they don't give up.
Friends to the big bags.
How?
Turn the Mini bags into an extra bag with their sizes.
This presentation that comes up in the Podyums has found the price for speed in the street.
Let's see what else we'll see!
The skin change in my skin
Turkey is about the world marketing for me.
He's now making this experience rich with design.
Loft is one of them.
We can see that there are just a few of these black models now that start taking place around every season.
In the season that the blacks are so high, he found his best friend.
The skin pieces and skin-driven structures are coming forward as a friend of seaweeds.
Usually, short models called "motorobic" are on my daily basis.
When the deep air is completed again, the syllables are long blus, the slugless cereal cereals, the spores of the spores.
Young people used to wear iron and disappear in the crowd.
She thought she'd save the day.
Now the kids want to carry a piece of a piece that is as comfortable as it is.
In this way, we can tell you that Loft's collections that he's prepared and the targeted parts can be correctly understood.
It's a big step for banksy, big step for "global".
"The Art of Bank" collection was performed in Istanbul, a collection of mystery street artist's works together.
The first exhibition of the art's 15 years of work and 85 original work was the first stage of the series of exhibition of the Global Caribbean building.
The first stage of the mystery street artist Bansky's first show was released in the Global Khakay (Rahm Street).
There is no doubt that the world's famous artist who is hiding his identity and who has no knowledge of the art.
We don't know he's not coming to Istanbul.
But according to Steve Lazdas's statement, Bansky is not aware of this exhibition.
He doesn't have to be allowed to get permission from him.
Because the old friend Bansky and Lazarusdas left after 12 years.
Some of Lazaridas' workshops are also found from the collections.
But Bansky's followers have things to worry about.
Banksy, what would he think of the "The Art of Bank" exhibit that he was brought together for 85 works?
For example, how would they deal with the price of 500 meters [35TL]?
Would the Red Balonlu Girl, Girl, Gül, could make a sound of the works of the world that are interested in things that are happening today?
It's a disappointment for Banksy Christians who hide their identity.
It's not Banksy's style.
But still before you're off the limited number of tickets!
For the small, global world for Banksy, it can be seen as the "The Art of Bank" according to November.
Such are the wrong-doers.
If you go, they'll dig.
President Recep Tayip Erdogan continued his reaction to the academics who signed the report.
They have indeed been Zalimun (polytheists and wrong-doers, etc.).
And indeed, the wrongdoers are wrongdoers.
He said, "They have committed [all] the same sin."
Recep Tayip Erdogan, who left his career in Sultanahtham, said, "In this state of peace in the city of Sultanahmet Mey, we need 10 of our German friends to be killed in this same country, because of the death of our German friend.
I'd like to report to the families of those who died first."
He said, "Our fight against terrorism will continue with determination."
Erdogan, who's willing to react to the agent's reaction to the academics, said: "In all these terrorists, I've been able to say that I've been able to stand up in front of all of those terrorists, especially if they have signed up under those regiments," he said.
It doesn't make anyone know who our people are, in front of you, who's in front of you?
These are the people who are infuriated.
Such are the Zalimun (polytheists and wrong-doers, etc.).
They have committed the same crime because they're with the killer.
And where are those boys in the city of unar, who are the three-year-olds with their father, who's going to go to this coverhouse?
How do they fit in their conscience with his killers?
I invite all the judges, the Senates of colleges, our constitution and our laws against these actions.
Last night, I told you that the steps he should have to be wiped out.
They'll do whatever they want to do.
Those who want to make politics will make politics in parliament.
But if they can't do it at the parliament, they'll go go on and they'll just go, or the mountain.
I'm so clear and clear.

Ten-11-year-old fighter Mete Gumerhan, who's going to live in Samsun, who lives in the family.
The father of the children won't let him take a check for the documentary.
Gümran explains how this is going on: "I thought I've been thinking about what I could do all day.
Because it could be a relief from the Ministry of Culture."
Dad was talking about a bed school in Alaska where the kids would go.
I've come to think about it.
When I was looking for two kids, I met 26 kids who were interested in the fight at school.
We started drawing preparation in a week, and we finished the tracks.
We didn't even have a place to stay.
"We covered it in the bedroom of the sugar factory."
It was the most difficult language that the documentary completed in three weeks.
Gumrhan, who said that the foreign image manager was talking to three different languages that the speaker worked on, said, "I didn't know what to meet when I was shooting."
He said, "They didn't know Turkish."

Mete Gumerhan says to work with the kids, "I've left them all natural."
I just tried to use Muhammad everywhere.
I took a shot at the first half weeks of practice.
They were supposed to act like the kids didn't have a camera.
"No, they get used to it quickly."
Getting picked up to Berlin has become a surprise.
"We had a surprise when young Pehlivans didn't expect the Berlin Film Festival to be elected to Berlin."
Young Pehlivans are not a sports document, but I'm a building that makes children's fight and cut off their lives.
"I wanted to plan for the stories of the children with family problems to get ID and deal with problems."

Don't let him get you into your feelings.
Show him that you respect his beauty to encourage his innocence.
Instead of teaching with a good example, discuss the names of the model.

Dr. Fövzi has answers to questions on the corner of Maydan Gazette.
I've got a salaries on my salaries and every morning I get up, after dinner, I'm going to the bathroom with my wife's pain two or more times a day.
Could that stop me from giving me a weight?
I'm starting to use it right now, but I don't want to eat, I can't get weight.
It's been like this since I was a kid.
What should I do?
Do you think I'm supposed to have surgery?
>>uzb_Latn<< CEVAP: Most times a infection is associated with the transfer of Safra.
This is a sign of what comes after dinner when you eat jokes and pour out a salad on the salad of a salad that you eat.
Dissolves who are at odds with a sedentary sediment, often try to throw it out.
That's why you often go to the bathroom.
And because you're going out in the hot bathroom, you're throwing your weight down and your weight is slower.
I think you need to treat this situation.
If you go to a Gastro internologist expert and I say you can get rid of this by antibiotics.
But at the end of all, you'll have to have surgery.
Alkalen probiotic can reduce your complaints a little, but it won't.

How can I handle this?
CEVAP: The desire of food is actually not fully accepted.
It could be why you eat less, or you can jump at lunch and lunch.
Another reason is that I can't break the food you eat.
For that, your test system needs to be healthy.
If you don't have a ulser, a favor or a similar problem, or the best way to use a better probiotic medicine.
You'll see it too much.

There's often information on how to slow down.
It makes sense to me, but it's a little different.
I can't get a weight.
I don't know why.
He doesn't say anything in the doctors.
CEVAP: The techniques that we apply are not only to weakness but to return the physical activity of the body to an ideal measure.
Inflammation is the same kind of disorder as fatness.
It's also treated by the same technique when I can't weigh weight in fatty.
You are the ones who eat sweet things and are very weak.
I think you understand that until now.
You can also take weights with your carbohydrate and your healthy diet.
I mean, you're far away from your ideal body.
And the other patients are far away from their ideal bodies.
You're going to reach your ideal body by weight, and they'll get a weight.
If the system issues rise up, you get weight, they'll get weight.
But first, the system needs to work properly.

"The child who feels worthless" feels like a child
There are some emotions born in the human world.
Fear, sorrow, joy, joy, anger, anger, anxiety...
But the feelings of hatred, resentment, and revenge are reflected in the children with time and some wrong attitude.
Every man needs to be an individual to be a child's age.
So, your parents or the social environment should respect your decisions, ask questions about matters that concern him, and feel valuable.
Their well - being contributes to the development of a healthy human structure.
For example, behaviors such as child care about the child’s needs and needs are not to respect his wishes (e.g., a child who wants to be sent to the school) rather than to be sent to a child’s institution.
A child who has no respect for his existence and the existence of his existence will reveal his anger and hatred to protect him.
"Because it's actually the opposite of anger and hatred," psychologist Hill Arslan says that the child doesn't accept what he hates, he tries to tell himself and himself.
"I mean, I mean, that the child's ability to accept and react in such a way that he reacts is a positive development, "I mean, I'm "I'm here to protect the child's respect for his own."
He says, "If the boy's a person, he's going to get out of the middle."
He's trying to protect himself by putting on anger and hatred
Arslan, who said that the loss of children in childhood and in so - called spiritual and spiritual times can cause emotional and emotional pain to occur in the child's youth, says that it would be invisible to the child.
"It may not always meet the needs of their emotional needs (e.g. don't smile, kiss, school, or other needs), and sometimes they may not take physical needs (e.g., drinking, drinking, school needs, etc.).
That's what the anger is and what a door to hate is.
Insulting and abusive speech, there are actions such as acts of violence, abuse, abuse, abuse, abuse, and serious punishment, no cause, no value, or no value.
Such behavior is deeply affecting the child’s personality.
"A child or a child who accepts these things and loses his self-concepts and makes his life self-conceited, useless and inflammable, or struggling to protect himself by anger and hatred."
