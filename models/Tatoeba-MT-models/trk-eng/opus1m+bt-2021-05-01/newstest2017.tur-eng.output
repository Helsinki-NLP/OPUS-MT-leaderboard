28 She was killed at the San Francisco Alliance Center
The 28 - year - old cook, who moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the center of a local shopping center this week.
But his brother said that he might not be able to hurt him, and he said: "In his mouth there was a good job for him."
San Francisco Admiral Medical Curry announced that the body in the Westfield University Center of Westfield revealed that it belonged to Frank Galcia, 28 years old.
San Francisco Department reported that the death penalty was determined and continued research.
Louis Galcia, brother Louis Galia, revealed that the EU station in San Francisco had started working as a member of the United States office in Boston, working as an kitchen department in the same dream six months ago in Boston, San Francisco Sons and Daughers began working as a team.
Sons & Daughers, the authorities of this death, said that the death was "rescuing them and being very sad."
"We're a small team working here, and he's going to be very self-existent."
We'd like to say that Frank was not alone in Frank's family at this difficult time and that our prayers are with them.
Louis Galcia said Frank was staying at the hotels in the beginning and said, "It's going well for him."
Louis Galcia said to the KGO, "He took a apartment and went out with a girl."
Louis Galcia said you didn't think you could be someone who might want to hurt your little brother.
He was a kind man with a big heart.
The way to communicate with the family has always been to prepare a plate for us to eat food," Louis Galicia said.
He wouldn't like to get into the conference.
My brother, he was able to fit in any situation.
He said, "As I go all the other things in the world, it's not that

>>uzb_Latn<< Asian doctors are in gravy: New business calls for slowing down calls
Asian doctors wanted to let the union slow down business by slowing down the business.
The British Tabernacler Union (BMA) was called upon to support the General Council of Doctors (JDC) to slow down work operations from the beginning of September.
JDC said the guards couldn't get any concerns about the contract.
The Asian doctors and medical students used a rehearsal contract with the UNA.
This has been rejected by the voters of the month.
On Thursday night, JDC president Ellen McCourt said that the government had been "satisfactory" with the problems that caused the government to reject the agreement.
He said, "In this light, the JDC governing body has used votes to reject the proposed new agreement, and has been called to re-engine again about the concerns," he said.
In response to the silentness of the government, the UNA board has made an official request to allow the U.S. government to slow down a program.
The agreement caused the assistant doctors to join the six greves in the history of NHS this year.
Dr. Johann Malawana, the assistant leader in the UNA, was released after giving up the agreement that UNA was offered.
At the meetings of 540,000 assistants and medical students, the UNMA members said that it was a good deal to accept this.
Following the vote, health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the contract would be appropriate for doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: One's an alliance?
That's a jestler that ends the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey came together to hear that eight months of war had been officially interrupted by eight months of war in order to break up on Tuesday and Tuesday, with words and economies.
However, while Vladimir Putin greets his Turkish officer at St. Petersburg's show, I've been caught in the barber's presence, and I've been in the presence of a lot of people who wanted to take this peace.
Hand's stuck, yeah.
But Mr. Puttin's smile was pretty weak, and he couldn't say there was no heat against his limited standards.
On the contrary, Recep Thai and Erdozan mentioned "good friend" in the number five times, according to one report.
I'm surprised the number.
He also promised that relationships with Russia will not go back to the level of crisis, and he would reach higher levels.
The next day, in a newspaper, Mr. Erdogan was acting as though there was nothing wrong.
I think his excitement was showing the opposite of it.
However, the cold intuition that Mr. Putin gave it shows that the Russian leader did not forget anything.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned in the opening was the cause of the crisis: the Russian plane at the border of Syria.
Then the reaction from Russia was full of threats.
Your Honor Putin has accused Ankara of stealing from the back of Moscow.
The tension was bigger, he thought he was a friend of the other side.
Trust will be difficult to rebuild in real sense, maybe not impossible.
The idea of Russia has changed since November.
The media in the state control has been targeted to Ukraine for months and months.
Suddenly, everything's guilty of Turkishs.
The most serious of these were that the chief officials of the Supreme Court of Erdogan's family refused the illegal oil trade under the control of the Islamic State.
He totally refused it.
But the picture message from St. Petersburg was about the time when it came to the road.
Finally, because of this meeting, Mr. Puttin had agreed to request Erdogan from President Erdogan.
Russia can see this as a form of victory.
The benefits of the fire call for the village are very clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs friends after the failure of the last month and nearly the end of his defeat.
The terrorist attacks in Turkey have been very effective.
Also impressed with economic reasons.
Russia's implementations have been repeatedly shot; especially the bans that hold several millions of Russian tourisms each year in Turkey's coastal regions.
This number is almost 90%.
In Russia, different operators and rental companies were absolutely relieved that flights would continue.
They're bound to the end of the season in the mind.
And this week, the state television was re-induced that the Turkish products would be reduced in fruit and season prices.
If we're going to get a report from the Vedemosti newspaper, "The visitors are there, the tomatoes are here."
However, the visit was also a separate political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry that he doesn't have enough response to the fire entrance.
In addition to the violence that has taken on the U.S. to the U.S., the violence that has been on the rise of Turkey's ties with the West and its ties between the Cold War, Mr. Putin goes on.
The Russian leader was definitely collecting the symposium from Ankara because of his call to the Council of Representatives after the execution of the Russian leader.
We must remember that he also had this inevitable attitude for Moscow, who had a strong fear of the regime change.
This summaries on this display on the seaside palace, which explains to me that Russia and Turkey have told me that "the evil forces of the West have rejected and united the powers of the two countries.
Still, despite the image of this discovery, they're very different from each other.
One of these is the most important thing about Syria: Russia and Turkey support different parts of Russia and Turkey.
At least three hours later, at the beginning of the first meeting of the two presidents, he also supports that.
As Turkey's President, he chose to draw the gold out of the way when he was trying to answer a question about these differences.
There's no clear idea how the partnership will be formed in Syria.
But it's been a good idea for two leaders to start talking at least once after a few months, and every member of the Nato member and member of Turkey has been seen to shoot the Russian war flight.
The Republic Bank of Scotland is destroyed for clients outside Scotland
According to the director of the bank, the RBS market will go to the back office position.
The Republic of Scotland will be destroyed for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told the FBI that the RBC market was associated with global goals.
It was almost eight years ago that it was almost impossible to quit and give up.
In this time, the market strategy experts used 'RBS' to protect other consumer financial markets.
This has been supported by millions of sportsmen from the six U.S. champion Wimbledon Andy Murray champion.
Now, however, more national markets have been determined to be true.
The International Bank will be used by the Scottish clients, but the new beginnings will not be made.
In England and Galler, all of the attributes that have been transferred to RBS will be replaced as NatWest.
It's currently being used by the Wallster Bank in Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and the clients in North Ireland.
There's a lot more pressure for a national bank, and there's a little more pressure to take over; Cots, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEwan has interviewed in the Invernes-shire for clients and staff.
"From now on, we're going to be a bank that will become a bank that will be more likely to be a banker than this."
As the bank turned into a global market, the RBS became a global market.
I'm telling you we have local goals now, not global.
Each of these markers is going to be a little different in the community, and our staff will work under the name of these customers.
RBS explained that the six U.S. champion won't carry the sponsorship and raise the profile of different brands regarding sports.
"We've come to understand the financial bank because we've asked our customers how we can make a better bank for the customers."
Three years ago, we'd be a great bank for our clients, and if we said we'd offer these brands, I'd find this trick.
But I think you will see a lot of changes in our work and not our own needs, but by focusing on the needs of the customers.
We can get these markers back, so I think it's the right time.
Frankie Dettori won 3000 with the victory she gave in Newmarket.
After he reached the 2500 victory in Newmarket, he exploded.
Jokey Frankie Dettori won 3000 in Newmarket on Friday.
At the local site, John Gosden's train took the second victory of the night by winning the second victory of the night.
He's 45-year-old Italian, Engelless, is a golden jockey that reached this mile.
He's following Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Edredey, and Willie Carson.
He said, "It's a special situation.
I've been so touched by my family here.
I'm really happy that this is in Newmarket I started 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not just a Royal Ascot -- it's just a Friday night with 200,000 people.
I feel relieved and refreshed.
Theattor accepted the announcements by bringing Predlecation next to victory
Two jockeys that reached this mile: the champion was a champion, Richard Johnson, and 20 times a champion, found at 4300 on his career with full records.
We've got 4493 victory at Lester Piggott's career nine times.
Frankie's one of our best jocks, and it's not surprising that just a few people reach a mile before him.
He is a man of power and strength, but he has a moral sense that he has the power to carry heavy pressure from others.
He represents his horse race in remarkable ways, with his enthusiasm and his career, he's been targeting people for years.
A couple of weeks ago, I told Frankie that if it wasn't just for weeks and for the big competition, there's only 6000.
It's serious, Frankie has spent 30 years fighting in the United Kingdom with victory, so it's wonderful to see it.
He has a very exciting character, and it's very good for the English contests, but it's a wonderful jockey beyond that.
Frankie Dettori blessed the horse with an injection of the horse to the symbol.
He's been in the symbol of the British independence neighbors for 20 years from the race he's been running through the jump.
It was a way full of progress.
In 1996, winning a large race of famous winning the famous "Birk Sevenli" victory in Ascot, he remained alive in a plane accident and was banned because he did not follow medical law.
Three years ago, during the period of the six months, the beginning of this six - month rescue process had a strong character in order to expose the people who were suspicious of themselves and return to the best.
And he said he wanted to continue for a while; he said he wanted to continue at least 50 years old.
Russia president Putin, special castle sent Sergei Ivanov.
Russia president Vladimir Putin received a special pen from Sergei Ivanov as an unexpected mission.
Mr. Ivanov was part of the close area Mr. Putin's trust for many years.
At the age of 63, he is now a special representative for the environment and transport problems.
In a statement made by Kremlin, Mr. Putin's "Ivanov's decision to end the Russian commission" was stated, but no reason was given.
For this position, it was announced by Anton Vaino, a representative of Mr. Ivanov from 2012.
Vaino, 44 years old, is an old diplomat.
In 1972, Estonia's capital was born, born in Tallinn, the United Nations Association (MGIMO) and served as a member of the United States Department of Justice (MGIMO).
Later, the presidential protocol and the government's manager was interested in the government's administration; the expressions on the Kremlin web site (Russan).
After the appointment, Mr. Putin said to him, "Thank you for trusting me."
I believe the most important mission of the management is to support your activities as head of the state as a way of supporting the law and the implementation of the instructions.
Mr Putin explained that he wanted the Russian television channel to be taken away from the U.S.
The smiles are convincing?
It's a move to hate Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov had been working as one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies for a long time, and the Soviet security forces, like him, served KGB.
As a private pen, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, and in a public television, both said that the private pen was carried out by its own desire.
But, despite the smiles that have been given to the cameras, very few people here are convinced of it; especially during this time of parliament's election.
Is it a conflict with some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
However, a person who might be president was suddenly faced with big doubts about the idea of attempting to direct Russia's environmental policy.
According to the Kremlin website, Mr. Ivanov said to Mr. Putin, "In the early 2012, I want you to trust me for four years if you can talk to me about this problem -- even if you can talk to me for four years.
Well, four years later, I've served as the presidential Council for eight months.
Your Honor Ivanov took this mission in December 2011.
He had been assigned to the Prime Minister and the Department of Defense.
He himself is the member of the Russian Security Council and the President of the United States, as well as the President Putin.
At the end of the 1990s, Mr. Ivanov agreed with the President of the Federal Security Board (FSB).
When Mr. Putin went into exile, he was showing Ivanov as one of the five most trusted people he trusted.
Since Mr. Puttin's leadership was on the third round, Mr. Ivanov thought that Mr. Putin would be President after the second time.
But this mission was transferred to Dmitry Medvev, another close ally of Puttin.
Mr. Puttin became Prime Minister after three and a half years.
Thomas Gibson, the star of the Criminal Minds series, was fired after he hit the producer.
Gibson was involved in a physical fight in Los Angeles's set of the month we passed.
The EUC Studios and the CBS Television Studios, who were involved in the design of the directory, heard that it was removed from the common public.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Hotchner, announced on Tuesday before the feasibility of the feasibility.
There are differences and differences about creative matters.
He said, "I'm sorry about something happening."
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios' brain tells us how Gibson's character will be removed from the FBI agent.
A 54 - year - old actor, who was just 54 years old at the State Council of Dharma & Greg, was on the show in 2005.
Gibson said, "I love the Criminal Minds, and for the past ten years, I've tried to give him my heart and soul."
I'd like to stay until the end, but it's not possible anymore.
I just want to thank the writers, producers, actors, great teams, and most importantly, to those who have the best support they can have.
The show is expected to return to screens on 28 September.

Queensferry passed: The bridge has now been connected to Fife
The project worth 1,35 billion should be completed until May 2017.
The engineer united the north and violet of the Queensferry District, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of the four exceptions between the "tabliian falcons" that each of the bridge is about to complete.
The height from the bridge is 600 meters long and 300,000 tons.
Ten thousand tons of steel and around 20,000 tons are made of 46 support cables.
The project worth 1,35 billion should be completed until May 2017.
Prime Minister Keith Brown was one of the first men to visit the facility today and travel to the bridge.
He said, "This is a history and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry.
We all bear witness to this project in real detail, in order to build this section of the bridge.
It's a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot, but it's a lot of a lot of fun.
Usually, nearly 77% of the total bridge has been moved to close, and this means that the first quarter of the chart will be set up on Rossyth today, which means that the whole building will be ready to be removed over the bridge.
"In all bridge projects, the first closed door is always a major journey.
In this extraordinary project, this opening represents the pioneership in construction engineering.
We were supposed to close the empty space on the north side after the last square of the final calorie tab and the expansion of the North and the north.
This was performed by the south of the country to the south until 700 miles [700 km].
It's a big one, but it's also a very sensitive process.
It's big because the virus was 222 meters long, about 6,000 tons of weight, and it was supposed to be about 3%.
The reason he was Hasass was that the team was too low to follow, and only a few milligrams.
Anyway, everything went well.
Moelfre Corporal rescue team: three men are lucky to be in life.
Three men were lucky to fall off the fishing boat in England after they fell off the fishing boat.
Moelfre announced the RNLI lifecraft station on Friday, after seeing the case at Molfre Corfez, on Friday, with the English summer watch.
Three men tried to swim to a safe area while their boat was on their way.
Moelfre's life-threatening manager said, "We've seen that he's drawing the proper apartments, and we've been worried."
And he said, "Oh, we have been led away from them [so far] as they were guided."
While two men were saved by a local fishing boat, the 60-year-old man was arrested in a
They're all taken to a liferandian philosophy, and they're brought to the lifecarration station.
Mr. Jones said, "The three men who left the country are lucky they were alive and they never got any benefits.
There was an emergency cable in the boat, but when the boat was a boat, it must have disappeared from the person who used the boat.
He was watching these three men today.
A valuable blessing for health and happiness, Pokémon Go
It's really exciting to see how the world changes.
For the past ten years, many of us have felt sad.
Pokemon Go encourages people to move away from the couch.
When he spent on screens, he was at first connected to video games and finally made available to smart phones.
So it's wonderful to see that technology and open air are not the elements that separate each other.
Of course, I'm talking about Pokémon Go, who was originally created for the first video game game in the '90s (and later, later, game cards, and other products) that are based on characters.
Like many countries of the Popular culture, this new game has joined each other when it was presented in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
Later, in the servers, the presentation was delayed in other countries because of the intense interest that caused them to be loaded.
Over the days, Pokémon Go Tender has reached the same number as the same number as Twitter.
So how's he working?
In short, players take their smart phones and go to Pokémon with the GPS to look for them and take 'fograph' (telephoning the screen picture) or 'to take them'.
It's crazy to get out of the couch for a generation of young people who play in their younger years.
The game in the United States has made a significant increase in the number of times a person has taken every day.
Cardiogram, who was a developed application for Apple Watch, and who watched 350,000 users in the first two days ago, reported that 30 percent of those who attended Washington Post in two days were up to 53 per day.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go; only he can see data at the exercise level.
Most public health campaigns that encourage "30 minutes of time" and "supervised" are being active every day, most people have been looked forward to sharing the message of public health and being sent by those who appeared.
But no matter how much exercise is involved.
It reduces the risk of depressive exercise, cancer, or depression.
Without an exercise, weight control, high pressure, and diabetes, he has a long-term advantage list of long-term agents to be listed here.
But Pokémon Go's beauty is to do something that people enjoy.
In this way, there are three basic elements of health: move, clean air, and sunlight.
Some people can even get a new friend during the hunting.
As usual, there's also some dumb gamebodies looking for something to complain.
And of course someone can hit the door while walking.
What does it matter?
It's a big innovation.
Even though the smart phone applications like Fitbit did not offer us a reason to act like this game.
The effect of the news is going to be over and the use will be slowing down.
But because of Pokémon's success, applications and virtual reality will be made a lot of games that help people to be more active and healthy in the real world.

Simone Billes closed the gold medal on the dymnastic general evaluation
Forget the pressure.
Forget about your excitement.
Simone Billes has a connection to all of this.
It's dynamic about shooting.
It's safe on the degenerative device.
When the earth is shaken with want
It's perfect at first.
And he's a Olympic champion now.
The 19-year-old American journalist, who completed the general evaluation on Thursday, made the difference between him and the rest of the world.
He got 62,198 points, with a gold medal, and a friend of Aly Rasman and Russian bronze bronze, the owner of the Italian Mustafina.
Simone Belles from the United States on Thursday, 2016 Rio de Janeiro summer Olympics in Brazil showed an increase in the articulation of articulation.
Billes became the fourth and most American woman in the background, and maybe the best of all time.
When the last gathering was broadcasted, the long journey to reach the mother was finally over.
This success led to the same level as Michael Phelps that could be seen once every generation of new levels, including Michael Phelps:
Billes spent the last three years as a 15 World Champion and the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Louis Retton, who called himself the best journalist I've ever seen.
One last test in Brazil was waiting for him, and this contest was between him and the other people in the race with Billes.
Texas was going to be seen as a disappointment when he returned to his family in Spring with less than a gold medal.
After receiving gold and silver gold and silver medals at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro summer Olympics in the United States, which was held in the United States, at the left, Aly Raisman, Brazil.
Biles won Tuesday on Tuesday, the national team director of the national team, Martha Karolyi, who was serving as a famous sign in his home party.
Even if Belles never looked forward to this long runway, it's not exactly true.
The part of the Earth's magnetic receptor is also prepared with Latin music that will fit the outside of Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
She was discovered by Boorman's mother, who had been married by her grandmother, who had been adopted by her grandmother, who had been adopted by her grandmother, Amee Boorman's mother.
It has not lost any of the general assessments since 2013; it's a financial series that Bills needs to continue until he wants to.
It was temporary if Mustafina took the lead in two courses.
It's not yet accomplished the balance of the world's champions and the Earth's spirits.
He went ahead with 15,433 points in the Denge Act, and he was crowned by 15,933 at the ground heat.
Raisman was very upset with him while he was waiting for the final puun, and once he was writing a blue, white, blue, blue, and blue.
Raisman's performance was like four years ago that he lost the bronze medal in Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the United States named "Nine."
In time, he sent a kiss to the crowd after an unexpected return, which appeared to be a suspect.
For the 19-year-old Billes, it's said that Tweet's very sharing in this week is now a completely new concept:
Police: Three victims in the serial killer were shot in the car
For the past ten years, two women and a 12-year-old girl in Phoenix's first serial killer and a 12-year-old girl were shot in the car while they were talking on Thursday.
The authorities said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Ellis were shot on a garage road on June 12th.
In the report, the gunman was standing on the side of the car with eight shots on his car and ran away with another car.
The police say these three murders didn't appear to be a crime, because they didn't get the old victims' purses or $2,9000 money.
Phonix police officer Jonathan Howard said that the armed attackers were trying to determine whether it was connected to the previous four assaults.
During a period of four months, the Spanish population died in nine attacks, and two were injured.
Howard, at the beginning of this month, explained to the CBS staff KPHO: "This is the place in which it is in front of a house.
The suspect is thought to have been using a number of tools, such as black BMW and white paper or Lincoln, to the end of the 1990s.
The researchers refused to explain the evidence that the attack was related to the same killer and that the same killer was performed by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was removed to the hospital because of the injuries, and then he lost his life.
Liner (31) and Ellis' daughter of Maleah lost her life at the scene.
A witness to him told the police that these people did not have to listen to music by sitting in a parking lot.
The authorities also reported a police report on a firefighting event about three and a half hours before the death of three murders.
The researchers found the bullet guests, removed a bullet from a chair, and discovered the bullets in the engine section.
The mother of a 6-year-old microfaly patient says, "He's getting a good job."
Like most six-year-old boy, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, playing games, and sure he loves his mother.
In contrast, Edmund has a microcephatic disorder, which is not known to his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto's pregnancy.
When I first came home, my first thought was I couldn't do it.
I can't do that.
I didn't want it.
Of course it's not true, of course you want it.
He and his wife told Vincent that Edmund could never know them and even survive.
Some doctors have gone too far to offer him to get in the nurse house.
Picciuto said, "My first reaction is that people don't think I'm doing it anymore."
Edmund can walk with a walker.
Edmund couldn't sit down until he's three years old, or he can't go to bed and still can't talk.
But he has gradually reached some of the steps he needs to take.
He can walk with help and get on a bike.
Besides, he likes to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign that Edmund used to say "please sing to me."
Picciuto said to CBS News, "We teach him sign language."
But that's not the sign language we know, but Edmund invented his own signs.
The microcephali may appear because of a different situation; a genetic situation, like Edmund, may exist, and may be derived from the infections that occur during pregnancy and Zika.
The symptoms and disease can be very different.
It's more early to tell those who have a Zika infection how their lives will be affected by this situation.
Picciuto remembers the emotional burden that the future has produced.
I was always asking what would happen.
What's going to happen?
And he still doesn't know that.
Actually, I've been asking a question about the condition of disease for a long time since I didn't really expect anyone to tell me.
Picciuto, however, is able to offer hope for the mothers of babies who have been born with Zika.
It's getting better.
You know it'll be better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.

It's like something like this.
In Mississippi, Harrison's emergency emergency manager Rupert Lacy Körfez said the rain kept steady in the Red Sea.
On Tuesday, he said that he had been told that he had been sued in several homes, but he had no word for Friday.

"The body was torn apart by bullets," 6-year-old Mahj Brown survived the attack by Philadelphia.
The police explained that the six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, which is the second event that a six-year-old child was shot in this city this week.
CBS identified Mahj Brown's grandmother and grandfather for Philadelphia.
In Brown's body, his grandfather and grandfather, Brown, said that there are more than one fire gun wound in the areas inside his leg, arm, and snow, but only when he was brought to the hospital, he was brought to the hospital.
Her grandmother, Delores Melendez, said to the station, "It's a lot of pain, a little
I can't believe this.
He was listed among those who protected his son's crisis in the hospital and passed some surgery.
The family told the station that he was expected to heal.

Brown was among the four who were shot in the German region.
They were both 29 and 32 years old men were shot.
CBS Philadelphia said one of the 29-year-old men was critical, and the other two victims were stable.
The station reported that one of the 29 - year - old men with a crisis had been shot in the front seat of a car with a car.
The other two victims weren't in the car, and the police investigated if one of them was attacked.
The detectives said that CBS might have shot more than one armed attack against Philadelphia.
The crime scene was full of mercenaries in the form of the attack of various attackers.
Looks like it's definitely been a long fight.
In the street and on both sides of the board, there were guests.
This means that there are more than one armed attackers and both of them are active," Philadelphia Lieutenant Anthony Ginadi said.
There were more than one house and a vehicle in the area.
Any arrest wasn't possible, and the police were reported to check security cameras.
A six-year-old boy, six-year-old, was shot at his arm in front of the West Oak, playing in front of his house on Tuesday.
He's still looking for a suspect during his recovery and the police are still looking for him.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie are the reasons we need
I put this name on the Olympic Jimnastic Team this year, and there's more than one reason.
First, I joined all summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. never had so much pressure before.
And second, this team has three jinxes that inspire many different ethnic roots: Simone Billes, Gabby Douglas, and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez.
The structure of this team that was brought together by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian is proud of.
The team is finally showing a similar appearance to America.
It also strengthens the presence of black and Latin-born women on high levels of this sport.
In the last four years, the first woman became an African-born American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were on 1 and 2.
That's a strong thing.
In the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise champion, and America supported him.
Now, the whole world's three world champions, Simone Billes, Douglas, and Laurie Hernandez, can be seen as an unexpected performance from the great jinx.
On Thursday, Simone was four Americans who won gold medals in women's general assessment.
And his team friend, Aly Raisman, won silver medals.
We recognize the best times of this sport, but it doesn't look like this in the history of the country.
Simone, Gabby, and Laurie watched the same way as Aly and Madison to get a place on Olympic teams.
The reason why they're "Son Five" is that the next Olympic jinx will be only four journalists, and that's the last year that Martha Karoly will do an experiment.
However, journalists and journalists are primarily working on special jincision clubs that support education, travel, sports, sports, hotels, sports, and family.
Most of these jinx clubs are located at the local bank sites where they can deploy these works.
These clubs require a rich and long-term care for the families of the journalists who can be trained.
Simone Billes' trainer Amee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez's coach Magie Haey since they started their jinx.
We don't offer public education for many young girls who have been affected by Simone, Gabby, and Lauriie.
I built my own jinx page 20 years ago.
In my colleges, Harlem was offered a free and low-powered jinxed jinx education on the 150,000s in the city of Harlem.
In September, we're going to expand to Detroit (i.e., who deserves this great Olympic sports and who deserves the opportunity to benefit from it.
Jimnastic develops the strength of the body and the coordinator and improves the quality of self-efficacy, discipline, and determination.
This combination, health, school, and a long-term advantage of success.
Thousands of young girls are going to be inspired by this team, and it's amazing.
I'm involved in sports activities, especially for girls.
We're really going through exciting times.
Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby, and Madison brought gold medals to the Olympic team and said that many young girls have developed a healthy, strong, successful young woman.
Following Jeremy Hunt's suggestion, assistant doctors decided to continue the strike.
The Ministers hoped that the agreement would end up with the British Tabernacle members, but the 370,000 assistants who participated in the vote would give up 58 percent of the vote.
In July of July, Mr. Hunt explained his plans to ensure that NHS's "no property" and that the life of more delay would harm both staff and patients.
The first assistant doctor participated in a new contract to improve the health of a doctor group, outside normal hours of care, including nights and weeks of work.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, president of the U.S. President of the U.S.A., said: "Assia still has serious concerns about the acceptance of doctors, especially if it triggers the current work crisis, and is not the same as all doctors."
The first doctor has to make progress in this process only eight weeks after the new contract, and it's about to be up to time.
The efforts of UNA to resolve conflict have been answered in some cases, and in some cases the government's lack of motivation for the development of the government.
This is an event that appears despite the fact that Jeremy Hunt's last month's door was always open.
"Jermy Hunt's move immediately, he needs to keep my work and listen to assistant doctors' concerns."
Asian doctors sincerely ask them how they are prepared to slow down their actions, even if they don't do this.
At the end of April, nearly 130,000 rubin operations and 100,000 dates were delayed, nurses and consultants had to pay attention to the doctor's letter.
The Ministers hoped that there would be an agreement between the British Tabernacles and the United Kingdom.
BMA wants to improve the weekend's fees for 540,000 assistants.
The NHS workers manager Daniel Mortimer, the assistant doctor, urged doctors to apply any gervity.
"Gerv is not going to solve anything, but is now under pressure on the team and the services, the guards and the families, the anxiety and anxiety of their families," said Mr. Mortimer.
For the past two months, we've kept our conversations with the Republican Doctors Committee, and with the Department of Health and the other officials, we've been very concerned about the Ministry of Education and the IQulluma.
Workers have been aware of the extent to which they agreed to have a positive relationship with secular education, education, education, education, education, education, and sexual relations between students in the community, as well as the relationship between them and BMA.
A drug that can remove the risk of heart crisis on a day, 2 1⁄2 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Thousands of heart disease can benefit from 2 quarts a day - to - day medical medicine.
The trader, trying to prevent treatment, reduces the risk of resiliency for those who are having a heart disease.
The medicine was about to reduce the risk of felic or another crisis for 12 months following the heart crisis.
The NHS monitor suggested that it would be given to people for four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NHS monitor suggested that it would take four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Every year, 14,000 people spend their heart attack every year in England and one of them spend another crisis or other strokes.
The cause of heart attacks and strokes is the production of plastics in the arteries.
If the plastic is broken, it can cause the heart of the heart by preventing blood from causing it to the heart disease.
And if the phosphorylation is removed from the ground, the blood flows into the brain's brain to stop blood flow.
It's a risk of spending another crisis before.
Tcatagrelor, who is created by the United Kingdom of the United Kingdom, reduces the risk of the risk.
Today, the NICE director recommended that people receive 90 mg traderellor for 12 months and then use 60 mg per day with aspirin for three years.
"Even though there are some four other heart crisiss that exist in the heart attack, and usually the results are devastating."
The fear of reenacting again can have a very positive effect on the quality of life.
Delimss show that the use of commercial aspirin is effective in reducing the heart crisis and the risk of stroke.
We're glad to be able to increase thousands of people who are expected to take advantage of this.
Since there are three years of knowledge about the growth and security of the Ticarrelor, the lawsuit is limited to the risk of blood risk, the law enforcement plan is not issued during this period.
PC culture increased the moon corruption in Muslim territories
The former Tover Hamlets mayor Lutfur, who was charged with corruption last year after the government report
Today, as the corrupt government reports show, political injustice has led to an increase in the culture of Muslim society.
The former Kabaine Minister Sir Eric Pickles accused the police, election officers, election officers, and the Mayor House of Representatives, because of the fact that "inexplicability of the ethnic background and high level of religion."
The old community secretary and our day-consumption call for corruption is so bad that the voters should be allowed to vote without voters in order to protect the fearers.
The voters suggested they found their identity in order to prove their identity at the time they voted.
In the case, the choice's name and address is enough.
The report also suggests that during the operation of votes for votes twice, the party has a permanent contractor.
Sir Eric said those in the report should be protected in a better way.
He was called to have a better understanding of the decisions of the boards and non-substituted committees or teams.
He said, "It's not just the only way to protect ourselves against fraud, but also the local government intended to protect from corruption and financial corruption."
The report was prepared by Dowing Street after the moon scandal in the East London.
During the past year, a special election court decided to take the commission of the mayor of Lutfur, President of the Governing Body, after repeated violations and illegal applications.
The government recognized the feelings of the Muslim people as "supervised" and suicidal charges against Islam and Islam.
"The Most Beneficent (Allah) has made it a matter of worship for the believers."
By 300, the game was suspicious, or you used fake ID, so it was the end of playing like someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud in the country.
He warned about the corruptions of the people of the Muslim community, especially those who had been forced to vote on the basis of their own choice.
Sir Eric has also provided some suggestions to ensure that the system of votes is included in order to prove who people are.
The report says: “It is found that ethnic ethnic groups have been forced to vote in the right direction for elderly members of Pakistan and Bangladesh to be women and young.
"There are concerns that the government has been concerned that the economic growth of the ethnic background and the "consumption of religion" is the reason for this kind of conduct."
Sir Eric was also offered 50 suggestions to prevent political activists from using their post-to-sale papers in order to prevent the use of "sale" purposes.
The report from Theresa May also has been called upon to reduce records of records to prevent the move and social failure of the election.
The option of identifying identity before the voters are voted.
If anyone votes twice to vote for two votes of votes, then a permanent check of the person's fingers.
A system checks on how to determine the right to vote.
The demand for a three-year limit to using automatic mail.
The bans of political campaigns and activities that have been sent to the post-operative post-operative posts and post-operative votes that have been sent out.
To the police, voters are given the authority to take the throne around them.
The law was changed to make it easier for people to avoid fear.
It's illegal to take pictures in votes.
In their votes (but not in the Dutch), it's the conditions for speaking English.
Personelin is the strength of the training he has received to make his decision to get into the camp alone.
Sir Eric, saying that there was no crime in the Tover Hamlets case, the police accused the police.
"The Court has decided that there is no place to blame for corruption and illegal activity," he said.
For a series of reasons, he was found guilty of evidence beyond the reasonable doubt.
He also criticized the "culture checks" of the mayor's election departments.
Sir Eric said: "Tower Hamlets was a warning of the last year's sentence.
While our nation has the proud ability to create the mother of Parliaments, this concern may cause anxiety and disintegration of confidentialities and rejection by some institutions.
Like Kate's biker and the Rio Olympic players are crazy for other famous characters
During this week, Rio 2016 Olympics arrested, the French bishop, who proved to be very impressed by Cambridge Duline Ferrand-Prevolt.
However, 24-year-old Olympic athlete, this summer is not the only sport that compares the famouss with the gold medal; at least the social media.
Therefore, Rio set up a list of Olympic sports sports that we've seen in games and screens, F.EMAIL, Hollywood.

In addition to Kate's silicon, many around the globe have shown that one of his arrows can look like Leonardo DiCario.
The U.S. male team member Brady Ellison then attacked Twitter after showing up pictures of the appearance of the money hunter's star.
And he admitted that he had been saying that he was like Leo since he was a child in social media.
Brady said to the Huffington Post: "I don't think it's a big difference in hair and beard.
'Cause that's why I think it's a compliment.'
There's another similarity between London 2012's most popular and no doubt that this year, there's a similar comparison to that of Greg Ruforford's popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian journalist Algeria Mustafina's eyes, large and well-known American artist Gloria Estefan, who was the same.
And in the pool, South African explorer Cameron der Burgh, the star of Glee has been compared to Matthew Morrison for years.
>>uzb_Latn<< Change: This user means Nathan's initial movie star is a 'static version'
The tennis star Rafael and actor Josh Hartnett have been compared with each other for a long time because of the similarity of noises and lips.

Strong women: Fotball star Hope Soo (left) and Dexter's star, Jennifer Carpenter, has a face similar to that.
Not only: a Twitter user is very happy to see the difference.
A theory that is left in air: this user thinks it can be a reason behind this couple's appearance
One Twitter user added the joy of seeing "the rest of the crew think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are like twins."
They actually have hundreds of shapes and eyes, similar to the American football star and the actor who plays in Dexter.
In contrast with other popular differences, the actor Kerri Walsh-Jennnings is also present with Laura Linney's same smile as another gold journalist, Gabby Douglas, who is the star of youth with Gabrielle Unon.
The CBC Olympic athlete apologized for saying that the Chinese smile died like a pig.
Byron MacDonald's 14-year-old analysis of Ai Yanhan's 4x200 m free competition has greatly provoked the CBC's life Olympics on Wednesday.
One of the 14-year-olds of Canada's broadcasters, a 14-year-old woman, was forced to apologize for the comment that she died in the race as a 'dom'.
Spiker Bron MacDonald thought the microphone was closed when women started to explain their ideas in the 4x200 free flag race.
MacDonald, who's involved in the CBC's athlete team, said, "14-year-old Chinese soup, my baby."
He was so excited, he broke up like a bad smell and died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese ring Ai Yanhan (14), completed the second leg of the flag race by 1:57.79, the Canadian Taylor Rack was able to close the difference between China and China.
Canadian audiences moved quickly after they became confused with the tone and language
Emmett Macfarlane said, "Did your 14-year-old guy just die like a pig?
The idiot wasn't aware you're still in the field.
Chinese Ai Yanhan, 4 x 200 mm in free Bayrak region, described it this way: '14-year-old Chinese-year-old has broken down, baby.'
In Twitter very hard and fast, Briron MacDonald reported himself.
Twitter users didn't hold themselves when Bron Macdonald heard of how hateful he was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote these: "Way #Byron MacDonald.
You represent the CCC and Canada and why you all look like a dancer?
In a short time, Scott Russel, who drives the broadcast of the CBC, apologized for MacDonald's comment, said, "We apologize for the comment that we've published on the publication about the new race."
These were really unfortunately chosen words, sorry for having such a incident happened.
CBC has been forced to apologize for at least 90 times more than those who have been trained to comment.
Scott Russell, another sport, had to apologize for MacDonald.
CBC later published the Twitter user on the 90th of MacDonald's comments on MacDonald's comment.
The network made an explanation, rapidly.
We would like to express our sincere regret of being published and published.
Last night, last night, on the broadcast, in our audience, and in the social media, we'd always apologize to our followers.
We'd like to explain, Byron's comment was about his performance, not his face.
However, these were very unfamiliar and unfortunately chosen words, and Byron is very sad about what they said.
On Thursday, Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in the magazine and said he didn't want to be involved in a personal attack.
He said, "I want to apologize for a comment I made by women's flag race last night.
'I was putting on the performance, not the person's personality.'
'No, I didn't want to be disrespectful, and I'm so sorry.'
The primark client was angry with the woman who tried to make a drink in the middle of the store.
The clients didn't know what to do when a woman pulled her clothes on a store in Prmark's store.
Even worse, the woman looked at what it looked like to herself, took it off, put it back in a refill.
He continued looking, and then he tried four pairs of underwears in the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestonone.
Before the woman was recaptured, she was a Primark store in the Bouvierie Place shopping center in Folkestone.
Her mother, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at that time, said that after trying the mystery woman's underwear, she was dressed out of a store and went out of nothing.
He said, "The people were unable to believe in him."
He stood up in the middle of the store, and he took a piece of it from his vintage, put it on his keyboard soup and pants.
'He didn't try to look for a special place to do this, he was standing in the middle of all his disrespect.'
'And everyone was looking at him when he was out, and all he didn't like the paper, 'cause he'd put it back again.'
He tried three more laundry until he decided he didn't like anything, and then he got out of the store again.
"The people who saw his body didn't really care, and he didn't think he was going to buy the person he was trying to buy them later."
Ms. Davidson (33) said, "How disgusting it is to think someone's wearing a paper that's not dressed, unsatisfactory and going home."
This happened at Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added, "I think Peersonelin took out his clothes after he got out of the way, which is a good situation."
'And when I went home and went home, it would be really bad to think that someone else got dressed and washed up, and it was really bad.'
"Primark, 'Primark's news about what happened in our store on Tuesday, August 9, 2008."

How can you protect yourself against the armed attacks of Krav Maga?
The outside world is very dangerous, but the water of Dailymail.com can help you to be more secure.
To find out how to deal with armed robbery near the nearest distance, we met Rhon Mizrachi, the head of New York central Krav Maga Federation.
This video will show you how you can turn the robbery back or close to the back.
Mizrachi says that when you are near the back, the first thing you have to do is go back to your face, and you're saying you're going to get rid of the attack.
And then you're gonna shoot the gun between your front arm and your shoulder.
Then, when you fall into their shells, the attacker's pain comes in twice, and he takes the weapon into his hand, and then he's going back to his face.
As the gunman comes forward, the same technique is applied to your body, and you can't turn your body out of the fire line, and you can't make a gun and shoot the attacker.
At the same time, by putting your weight in a gun, you're going to turn a punch from the chest field and get the gun back to him and get the gun back to him.
Does that sound familiar?
Take a look at the video to see how Mizrachi did this.
But remember, if you're not a Krav Maga, you're going to have your safe way to get away from every robbery.
The Ian Wright guide has moved the language to the worst places in Europe.
The English travel took a serious test of connection system and correlation between Europe's worst and disgusting places.
The server and travel writer, Sufolklu Ian Wright (51), who was able to prove the power of the immune system, was a Euroban banknotu, a Picidary Sirki tree, a syllable of a train tube, and an acoustic phone in Russia.
He used a luminometry to show him what he was doing before he spread each object and what kind of work he did to us.
However, The Lickhiker's Guide To Inner Stringth had some amazing results.
While the idea of spreading a magic button used by thousands of people is extremely gross, there's actually a lot of worse bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical experts about the increase of brain bacteria throughout Europe.
Luckily, nothing he was lying on his mouth did not have any effect on the bad taste he left.
Mr. Wright was well known to keep his brain stable by traveling the world and eating strange and amazing things.
This mission, which has certainly tested the connection system of communication in the train stations.
"I've never been a good person since I was a child, and I've put a lot of things in my mouth until the soil, the worm, and the icy water."
And during the movie period, he gave clear evidence of the reason for this title.
The only thing she rejected was a dirty toilet in Russia.
The seed sample has shown me the number of aminoethymetry over the 4,000 members.
If you have to deal with it, the newly washed hands should be under the 60s of this number.
But in the new-born hands of 60, a Russian general who refused to burn over 4,000 members.
Mr. Wright and Fin milk products suggested that the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom, was replaced by The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Stungth.
He said in a movie, "It's about being one of the worst things I smell in this bathroom."
There can't be any worse than that!
I'm not gonna lie about it because it's disgusting.
The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Stungth, Fin milk products are prepared with Valio.
The company provided Valio Gephilus, who helped Mr. Wright to strengthen the lactic acid bacteria and the immune system.
"We really wanted to present something new to the audience."
It's impressive, and it's also something to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We've finally made a lot of crazy brain storms in the idea that we're finally looking for Ian.
They claim that the interest in brain health is global.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put products in a larger context; daily, the good and bad bacteria in our environment are connected to the immune system.
It's a global event about the brain health, and we've been able to give doctors more interesting information about this situation.
I'm also thinking that we have a wonderful sense of humor!
Tom Hala, director of the film, added: "I'll tell you, Ian, if I wanted to spread something like a gross Russian toilet, I'd lose my respect for him."
Granted, it was easy for Ian to spread things, but some were very difficult.
I'm glad we've got some of these bad news operations.
In a survey by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of participants were associated with the lactic acid bacteria, and 58% of the Lactic acid bacteria used at least as a measure of lactic acid bacteria.
Maganda's family, before the board, destroyed the Cornwall social site.
His family left the damage in the social site for their fear of their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and his wife, Shaun Trebbock, were thrown out of the hall in Cornwall.
When they were forced to leave the property, they were surprised to see that the property of the government was not available.
There were big holes on the walls, and the walls were covered with stone tablets, and the trash were laid down, and the walls were filled with walls.
The family is now isolated from the roof, and they think they're benefiting from private cosmetics.
Cornwall Housing's estate manager Donna McEvoy expressed fear that the situation could not be saved.
He said, "This is a real nightmare for people here, and I think people don't have to live like this.
There's a lot to do with the crash, because this property is now known as Cornwall's most inappropriate part.
This family has a bad reputation and has a bad reputation.
The family had three sons who lived together, and the police said that it was all too dangerous to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight close relatives, drug abuse, to abuse, to shout, and to fight, to fight, to fight, and to defend.
In June, the Treaty of Skeldon (47) was decreed for the Kira covenant.
Many rooms of the house thought to be loaded have been found in many rooms
In the past, drug sales were removed from the ground
The neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street, and the police were often looking for it.
After 11 weeks of meeting him and his wife, Cornwall Housing, who were engaged in their moving activities, were forced to pay off their property this week.
It was welcomed by the peaceful neighbors who said their lives were returned to prison.
One person said, "No one cares."
For 20 years we've been with them, and the situation was always bad.
You can't believe if we tell you how many times we see the police here.
'We couldn't sleep this morning.'
We wake up because it's too quiet, we're not used to.
They finally left, it'll be great now.
Cornwall's co-operation commissioner, Adam Fitzpatrick, says he didn't cooperate with the family's local policy.
The family was living in this house for 20 years and was often called police.
It was thrown to the side of the Social House with plants and old toys.
He added: "No responsibility for the director and his family is really embarrassing; he has always been adopted as Cornwall Housing's final decision.
It was a very difficult case because the actions were too low and the actions of neighbors weren't as scary to bear witness.
I really appreciate the efforts of members of the community who are courageous to give us information about my team, Devon, and Cornwall Police Forces and to give us information.
I'm hoping that this development will bring peace of mind to the neighbors and that you will not be attracted to antisocial behaviors.
Mr. Fitzpatrick said they had three sons in the property at different times, but they were 20 years old.
A dirty bedroom left in one of the bedrooms after vacation.
The contract workers will have to clean the garbage piles around the house.
In 2014, by pressing the police property, he found 70 grams of tars, private items, and 1700 cash.
Skeldon was sentenced to imprisonment after he admitted his crime of selling a class B drug.
The money was said to be used to bring a tomb for Lee Skeldon, his son, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After she was homeless, Tanya and her wife are now in a private room in Pollmouth.
Most of the house was to find walls on the walls of the room.
The police said they'd be working on the way to ruin the rentals.
Angela Crow, from Devon and Cornwall Police Police Department, said that there is a warning for the other churches who continue to break the rules of the board.
He said, "It's a message for those who think they can act like they want to act like they would not meet any accusations, and that they'll get out of their conduct."
The Devon and Cornwall police will never be pleased with crime and antisocial behaviors, to protect my community.
The tourists in Portugal were terrified by flying out of the air, flying from the north to the north.
Portuguese, the leading tourists in Aveiro, lived in shock of their lives
Portuguese Air Forces P-3C Orion has been flying very low.
Air Forces claimed it was a training flight, but there was no security risk.
That's when the tourists started to panic when they walked across the sand full of flying jet.
In the dramatic visions, there is a military plane near the coast of Aveiro on the north of Portugal.
Tatilists were worried about what was happening between them and what was true. They were worried about the noise that jet engines created.
This thing happened last afternoon at Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the few amateurs who share the video of the Dramatic approach in social media, said: "The two times were really low, and it looked like a bit like a hit.
Nono Arroja added: 'I'm making 'Surf' and I swear I'd feel like the plane was going to fall on me.'
On the beach in Aveiro, the plane from the beach to the very low pressure of the darkness fell.
Portuguese Air Forces said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a train flight to identify the fish boats on the beach and that the only way to control them is to go away.
As soon as it's close to the fire, it's said that it's too weak, but the air forces have insisted that no one is in danger.
This summer, the power to be shut down, the power fires have made a lot of details on the Portuguese mainland, and caused four people to die on the island of Madrid.
Portuguese air force means that today the pilot's view of the pilot needs to fly away from the heat and smoke.
The plane was on the flight, and as part of the study, the pilot was willing to identify the fish boats.
The London girl who joined the U.S. was murdered in Syria.
It was reported that Kadza Sulltana died in Syria, one of the three English students who left London last year.
The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said his family received information about his death a few weeks ago.
On Thursday, ITV News reports that his group was killed in a Russian weather attack that was strong in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and his family died while planning to flee from the country that had been damaged by war and to return to Britain.
"We hope that this situation is really risky for others to move to a grave and to the war zones of war and destroy people's decision," Akunjee says.
In February 2015, two young students from Sulltana and East London took a bus to Turkey and later to Syria's border.
She told Sultana's family that she married a US warrior in Syria and remained widow for months.
Reid said Clinton would not give up Garland as the Supreme Court's election.
Harry Reid, director of Democrats at Senate, believed that the president of the Democratic Republic would be a candidate for the Supreme Court of Hillary Clinton.
The Republicans in the Senate were trying to prevent Garland's approval from being approved by President Baack Obama in March.
Mitch McConnell, former Supreme Court Judge Antonin Slalia, said he would choose the new president.
Reid expressed his confidence in Clinton's choice of Garland on Thursday.
Later, a speaker who spoke to Reid said he didn't speak directly to Clinton about whether he would show Garland or not.
He commended Garland and said that Clinton's team didn't want to make a new choice.
Garland, Columbia State is the chief judge of the U.S. Temyiz court.
Reid said the Republicans who prevented Garland's island, the President of the Republic, would say that Donald Trump was the "distors" and "men."
Trump said it wasn't appropriate for the mission.
Treats said, "For women as much as they can, it's only because of a naked calendar."
The Treats magazine is working with the photographer David Belmare, David Belleyre, who was prepared for an inspiration from the 1970s.
However, instead of famous and naked people, 2017 UN Elijah Peries are trying to find new generations for the calendar.
Steve Shaw, president of Treats, said that this magazine was different from the old Playboys in the early year because "The Playboy is for men."
I'm doing this for women.
Clearly, I believe my calendar is like that.
Shaw said, "We need to go back to the classic naked in order that women can look at these images as a source of inspiration."
Women want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful art.
Models can send pictures as an online, or move them to open up to open talks in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinil target: who really is buying the plate?
The middle-aged men love the vini.
Let us explain that this brain is on the basis of truth before we go under the wonderful circumstances under the government of the United States.
According to YouGov, one of the many things that have happened is the return of the plaques of a physical object, not the Y bird that creates a physical object. It's the end of the middle-year-old nostalgia.
Almost recently, it's mostly between 45 and 54 years of age.
In fact, the 18-24-year-old group is the least.
It is also not just a way of bringing in curiosity; it's an emotional step; it's usually a feeling of the elderly who likes to keep their emotions (56% (56%) and (6%) who likes to keep their feelings alone.
And is it true of YouGov's results?
If this blog had been reported on TV, the camera would have been in a public street, walking with a gray suit of gray clothes, and when he was standing, he would watch a lot of jests, and then he would say, "Let's take a look."
Then let's take a look.
There are still a few famous record stores, such as Soho's central magic and unsatisfactory weather (sometimes found in hotels, Eats, Pretts, and Pperchases).
I'd probably want to stop from the camera for the next section, and I'd try to get information about the age and emotional circumstances of some of these stores.
The number of young women, two-year-old women (and three-year-old women) is the number that I followed in Glasgowu Stut (5) after a meeting in London for eight-year-olds.
I'm asking if he's a collectioner.
He says, "I think I am."
I've got about 3,000 or 4000 plaques.
The official was sent to me (respoiling me with e-mails) which I didn't follow him.
It's a result of so many albums and sluggings; now when they first arrive, they can buy their money and buy it back in young and unethical times.
"A lot of the things I've learned from the end of the 70s, I'm only 11 or 12 years old, and I'm too young to get."
She agrees with the idea of being a single person who likes to be alone, who likes to stay alone, who's got a high chance of being an idiot, and she added, "I don't drink, I don't drink too much alcohol.
That's my bad personality.
He thinks most of the clients he met in Sister Ray (225) were listening to YouTube profile.
However, he realized that a new wave that affects medicinal advertising has been found to be a new wave of people who heard this fashion came back.
In the talks I made, I realized that in 1998 or 1999, people took out their collections.
The clients who sell their venom to buy the CD first."
This may explain the rise of people in a certain age - old age.
What about the emotional importance of the record?
It takes a few seconds to realize that the photon store stores are a refreshing society that provides people with the same kind of security.
According to Wez, some older clients, especially the unsatisfactory payment system.
Some venial prisoners may want to be able to protect the stability of the loyal plaque caps from the digital world, and the memory of the live youth memories that we know.
Wez says, "I think this might be a reason why it's a waste or a material stuff can be seen as a kind of concert."
I've got this as a collection myself, and I think that's what most people do.
This is a easy way to fill your head.
He says that we're like a working friend who stole from a plate.
It was an annual event in April, which made it clear that 50 percent of the venill albums haven't listened to my album yet.
The market also found that 4% had no psych and 7% of the 7 percent of the record was bought.
At this stage of news, I'd probably show a very worried look at a series of bassa nova diet.
This return is an element that is identified by Johnny (42) who works for three middle age.
He said, "I don't have a plate, but I want to get a Radiohead plate to put it around."
Although it does not represent a large percentage, it definitely reflects the current situation.
More products, less music.
I don't have any money.
These aren't old people, young people, at the end of their ten-year-olds, are new entrance to this subject.
Now when I get to the Fopp, who's close to the venill, I see it's very different.
At the age of 70 there are couples, tourists, young boys, and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is nearly a little bit more intense than the previous store (the last part of Wild Beast's), it's good to see the different types of pop among clients.
None of them seem alone, but it's hard to define psychological traumas that bother them for over 30 seconds.
Elanora (27), he's been walking for a few minutes, and he's looking at the platforms in the drawer.
He just went out to take care of the veterinary.
He says he doesn't have the choice to make a record collection that he doesn't earn too much.
He's very valuable.
It's easier to listen to music in the above or other forms, but the Vininin beauty is far away from drinking like a loving person.
I don't know how to explain it, it's really not like it.
My last stop is a store of encouragement to the new generation prisoners: Urban Outuits.
I've been watching a group of young girls around the Polaroid cameras around a couple of young girls who've been working like Cot pants looking like they've been looking at.
On the left, Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse, and Flewwood Mac's empty space, without a middle-class link; a
No one's looking; maybe that's because they're just a record, and some are too high to touch.
It's completely a "senseal venill".
But the curious curiosity of these things can mean that the sector can earn more money and that less customers will be sent to Soho's deeps.
It's not surprising that a demographic group who has more money and time, like a venial, spend much more of their money on more expensive things.
But my findings show that the results of YouGov were at least true in Soho plaque stores; in fact, many women in the platform store, or in the inside of them, do not pay attention to the collids and venill holdings.
These people are probably very busy at school or in the office.
These people definitely don't escape from the eyes of a 30-year-old television server, who's always on Thursday nights, studying the record at Berwick Street, looking at the platforms of the middle-year-old boys who don't know anything about it.
Greenland shark, the longest forest in the world, is a video news
Science has explained that the Greenland shark has the longest life in the planet's orbitals.
Julius Nielsen, who worked on sharks, claimed that the record was between 272 and 512 years of age.
The French court rejected the offer to destroy stores in the Jungle refugee camp.
A court in France rejected the offer of Calais officials to eliminate thousands of refugees in Jungle camp and destroy the restaurant.
During the trial this week, the Calais authorities argued that the government had sold many products, made hair cuts, or sold 50 cents (40p) from food supplies for tea or 50 cents (40p).
Calais's authority was to eliminate these lands because they were risking their financial economy and fueling fire and fire.
Helpful groups said that the lives of the court and restaurants are important to the lives of government agencies and other groups and that the water of food is not enough for the campus.
They've made sure that the store store and restaurants often provide food for their owners and unpaid supplies.
A court in Lille said that there is no legal case to prevent people from entering a limited store, but the anxieties of Calais Valley can also be understood.
Judge Jean-French Mola said that doctors and restaurants were more likely to play a role than feeding only those who live in "very dangerous conditions".
He said these areas have made a comfortable meeting for refugees, refugees, and volunteers.
The book Kafe for Children who are in danger of being in danger gives them 200 lunch every day, giving English and French lessons, and counseling here about non-violent trade.
The person over 1700,000 signed a petition to protect this cage for children.
In a letter sent to Guadian, it was said that this closed operation would be a disaster for children who were about eight years old.
The two charitys, and L'Auberge des Migrants, on Friday, have concluded that the highest number in the Jungle camp is about 9.000 (from today's date of the year).
After six years in Fiji, British, rubgby, made silver medals in the seventh champion.
The effect of Great Britain's influence on the Rugby 7th Olympics, ended at the final final, Rio Deodoro Stadium in Thursday.
Fiji taught a great lesson about getting gold medals from the first Olympic medals from every color.
Next, Britain took the third silver medal of the day as a terrible relief prize, and the New Zealand, Argentina, and South Africa were proud of their efforts to show the Olymployment of the Olympic 7th opening.
At the beginning of the day, the half percent of the finals of the day may have found them after the South African October.
But it's still in this form, it could have won a 15-person team.
Even if it's not true, perhaps we can find comfort in knowing that the Great Britain will be at least a gold medal tomorrow: Fiji's chief artist, Ben Ryan, from Wimbledon, is an Englishman from Wimbledon.
It was a very difficult journey for Great Britain.
Eight days ago, when they worked with Ryan, they lost every game in the seventh Olympics at Adelaide.
This time, they just lost someone.
It's really a surprise to progress, even if it's painful.
Fiji has made a fascinating start, the players have gone through the attempts of Great Britain to capture the ball.
It was like running between a series of moving buss for Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, and the World Sersi champions moved from the corner to Osea Colinsao.
In the fourth minute, Jerry Tuwai was confronted with another number from the right wing.
The game was 12-0, and the Great Britain couldn't touch any more balls.
Mitchell's great intervention suggested that Leone Nakarawa take the prices of the mountain, such as the mountain.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua made a count of the right corner, and the Great Britain fell back 17-0.
When only a minute left for the first half, Nakarawa did another number from the beginning.
Later, Vatemo Ravouu left the line for a number of difficult British interventions.
With this number, the score reached 29-0.
While a team was established to play in Fiji 7, Great Britain was trying to find out the basics of work.
It's like this.
Great Britain has made big changes between circuits and closed the Fiji bar, and for the first four minutes, it was a good development until Joshua Tuisova went on the stage with the perfect Fiji game.
Dan Norton was tried a test for Great Britain, and he tried to make a show of 36-7, but he had the South Sea Island, who sang and danced.
It was really hard not to be pleased with Fiji's joy coming from the beginning.
Maa Viliame also found the final additions on the fuji game that doesn't need to appear in the last few minutes.
When the shop began, the Fijians began to celebrate, and the Great Britain was on its way to keep a dressing room.
At the beginning of the day, Fiji won Japan 20-5 at a half-five final, and Great Britain came against South Africa, with one count.
Kyle Brown, in the first half of the South African team, went ahead with the numbers that Dan Norton took in the second half of the lead movement.
Anthony's brother Marcus Watson's great intervention and gold was held in the first 15th of England.
Helen Glovers and Heather Staning, taking inspiration from the cancer of the terrorists,
There will be no more emotional gold medals in these games, and that's an important meaning.
Helen Glover and Heather Stannning, Estaciao, in Lagoa, in the early 220 cases, realized that they could be more aware of the fact that they won gold in Lagoa.
There were three voices on the boat, and the women had three voices in the boat, the first in the race for this year, as the first women in the race for that level, they were at the back of the second gold Olympic medals.
The rights were very clear; they were not as similar; they were 39 of the regulatory series.
And if we see two great athletes on the surface of the river, it doesn't reflect the unity of the victory.
In the back of every gold medal, there is a tabulture that makes this difference, and none of the hands that makes this difference, and no one can live until 30 months ago when the cancer was discovered that he could not live until he was able to see it.
As he said, they touched and they went.
I've been caught in some kind of medicinal cancer, and they did it.
If they don't do this, she's going everywhere.
That would be a very bad situation.
This changes your view of life.
He was introduced to Williams on December 2013.
He was very lucky to be treated for treatment in the early 2014 season, but in such situations, there's no doubt that it's a good statement, but it can't be at least obvious.
I had to pay, so I had to get better with it.
That was a encouragement for me.
I was in the hospital, and I was walking about six feet [6,9,15 m] in the garden despite telling me that it was enough.
That's how it started.
It's a journey by itself, but it's getting him a little bigger.
He was in Williams, who had been in a nervous morning to make his mind over his own concerns.
Stann, who is President of the United Kingdom, and earlier went to Afghanistan, said, "This week I've been emotionally crushed this week, maybe it's a little too much to say, but it's really big."
This is what it means to me, and Helen, and me and Robin are being shot again.
I've had a great three years with Helen and Robin.
If it wasn't Robin, I'd like to show her my greatest appreciation for the world's best practice.
I couldn't find a better person or a better practice to work.
Helen Glover and Heather Stan have not lost a race for five years.
Two, he's got a hard rhythm that his opponents can't reach.
The power of Stannning and Glover, the power of New Zealand and Denmark teams were closed at the last 500 meters.
We're the main one.
Helen was calling 's watching, watching, watching'.
It's really important not to go door and go.
We did a good start, and we couldn't do anything amazing.
We didn't expect the airport explosion today, we just wanted to win the race for a good shovel, so we did it.
The two will take a year before you decide what to do in the future.
There's a wedding next month that Glover has to join; he and his television adventurer Steve Bucksall's wedding.
He just wants to enjoy this moment.
I didn't want to tell you this was my last race.
That would be a lot of pressure.
She took me six months to notice that I was a Olympic champion in London.
That was so new and I was very stressed.
Here, it took about four minutes.
It's a better feeling."
It's a chance to watch the impact of the Los Angeles Central Library.
Find out the history of the Central Library at the center of the city; author of the book Arnold Schwartzman and Stephen Gee and Stephen Gee and the Mimy University of the University of California: "Los Angels Central Library: Art and Military History."
Gee and Schwartzman's 1926 Bertram Goodhue were planning to discuss and share their views and share the descriptions of the 1993 restaurant and Hardy Holzman Pfaviates.
The Salon will be revealed between the 21st and 1700 hours in the 21st century in the Art Deco South (the name of the Bullocks Wildshire) in the 21st century.
Participants can travel to the Middle Hall, the Regulatory rooms, the Kakutus Room and the Tea Room.
The tickets need to be taken before: loans will pay $25 for the SAH/SC members and those not members.
An open date in DTLA is going through a hot turn.
What else could the 90th anniversary of Los Angeles's Central Library be celebrated in another book?
Bulgaria has opened the First Ten Tenth Infectants for 8 months
According to national statistical statistics, the monthly rate in Bulgaria was 1%.
This is the highest value (from June 2012 to 2012) that we've spent a year with positive %0.2 per year from October to October.
The average annual annual rate (as of July 12, 2015) was compared to the previous 12 months (Aquaests) of July 2015 (UTC) compared to the previous 12 months (after July 2014).
It was 101.0% in July 2016 compared to June 2016.
From the beginning of the year to 2015, it was a difference between 0.2 and July 2016, and the average average of July 2015 was equal to 0.2.2.
In July 2016, compared to the previous month of 2016, prices were observed in the groups of consumers: food and alcohol (1.7,8), fun, restaurants, and hotels (%6,2).
The clothes and shoes (22), the furniture, the house crew, and the rubric (05,1) have fallen in their groups.
Alcohol drinks and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels; and prices in education groups are at the same level.
>>uzb_Latn<< Snapchat "Anne" Efficiency, the Asian Caricate
Although Snapchat says he's been taken from the anemiss for this filter, some observers say that it's a racial corruption.
Snapchat makes it possible for a 150 million users to play with abistr level of IDs every day with their lacek engine.
If you are a parent, you can turn yourself into a character from a dog or a Roy Lichtenstein.
Mercurys are an independent, specialized tool designed by 30 million people every day.
Wrong names are quickly copied into the memory of the camp.
The Snapchat mercurys faced charges that supported the use of an application in the past, or that the white-blowned cilts were called for beauty.
So, because of the fact that they offered their users this week, they were attracted by the lens that was a "Associal mask" of the Asians.
And they were wondering if the conflict again did not indicate a bigger problem with the company's diversity.
News and anger spread on Wednesday with the news of The Verge and Motherboard, and the day later, the Snapchat got out.
The company has been announced: Merck was prepared not to be confused with the Asians, but to anemi characters.
But for the viewers who have a race experience, this stereopathy reminds us of the painful pain.
The other people generally refused to compare my anima.
Grace Sarapani, who wrote about a Korean American art student and wrote about pictures of pictures, said that in one e-mail, there's a sense of pain and anxiety.
"It was hard to argue when the effects of the Flinter with the United States co-foundation cardiac congestion had been compared to the side effects of the fleet.
This means that the fleet is not just the Asian mask, but also an Asian mask at the same time.
Snapchat is not the only company who's out of cultural triggering mechanisms.
The American culture of the United States has found that there is an endless conflict between the Hollywood and the devices that all of us have in their hands.
And Snapchat's attitude may be expressed in a way that is more likely to be more sensitive than any other kind of race.
On Thursday, Katie Zhu, one of his 25-year-old soldiers, said, "It's harder for a user to see if this kind of movement is too difficult for a user to recognize."
Mrs. Zhu, an engineer who works for Media, and an engineer for medium, decided to remove the account of Snapchat, and gave everyone that call.
The report on the media and the phone for the media showed that the conflict with the race has fueled the lack of diversity in Snapchat's business applications.
Ms. Zhu ended his article with a label by attacking the majority of the company's leader team of white men:
Ms. Zhu, a Chinese-based American, said, "There are different races that do not have enough race, or they can make decisions that work in there and have different races, and these people don't feel safe or comfortable to talk to them."
Other audiences share their views about this complaint that Snapchat left her in the big room without answering.
The company doesn't share the number of numbers between the private company and the staff.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to share the political roots of the personnel, but according to one dictionary, the company was able to focus on the non-scientific policies that were not specified in the short term, including their work.
Ms. Zhu said he'd keep the Snapchat account closed, and he added, "I wonder if there are more users like us who can say it's not true."
The Kongre panel said that the U.S. Supreme Court has promoted the Islamic State.
In a report published on Thursday, a Congress panel announced that the U.S. Supreme Court of the United States approved a better picture reports of the war against the United States government, Iraq and Syria.
The Department of Agriculture, the Department of Agriculture, said that the U.S. Department of Justice, established a work committee that established the Constitutional Council of Justice, said that the United States forces changed the values of Islam.
The Central Commander, Tampa, in Fla., is a military leader who analyzes the American military operations of the Central East and Central Asia.
"In contrast, the results of the U.S. integral Centcom leaders have been found to be more positive than the fact that the U.S. has shown to be a positive picture of the effects of terrorism in the field, and constantly more positive results from the development of the other groups of intelligence."
"Those in the Republic of California cannot be accepted; the high-level decisions are a challenge to our war units when the high-cost states have been banned."
The leadership failure in the Centcom has reached the highest level of construction.
10 page report also reported that Central Commander's efforts to educate the American forces of Iraqi states and analyzed permanent problems in 2014 and 2015.
Even though there are no clear evidence of the fact that the government's government has ordered the investigations to change the report, it is clear that the editors also felt a better explanation for the development of the Islamic State, known as the ID and DADA.
"In the first half of the 15th century, many Central Command press press, brain and conventional expressions were more significant than the financial events.
For example, a Cencom authority stated that a great military attack could be made early in April or May 2015 to prevent Musul's return.
Musul, the second city in Iraq, is still in control of the Islamic State.
Mike Pompeo, a member of Kansas, said, "It's been quite clear since the months after the study."
From the middle of 2014 to the mid - 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court of the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the threat to the establishment of the U.S. government would not be considered significant.
The Republicans found out that the state of Islam had brought concern for the state of Islam.
As the progress continues, the report published on Thursday will follow a lot more closed findings.
The Department of Defense is also available to review another Centcom intelligence program that is being conducted by the General Inspector.
And members of the Republic of the State Department of Justice announced their findings of their own findings on Thursday.
"It has been a very difficult time in regard to economic assessments between 204 and 2015," says Captain Adam B. Schiff.
According to Mr. Schiff, the process has slowed down the results of "substance results," led to the moral corruption of the analysts, and has not given enough space for the "study meetings."
However, Mr. Schiff and Democrats claimed that the results of the White House had not been reached the findings of the Contentcom analysts, or that they had been forced to make a political statement.
The early results of Congress were announced on Tuesday by Daily Beast.
In August of August, New York Times reported that a Pentagon inspector was mostly investigated after complaints made by the Cencomists.
Upper Commander Patrick Evans stated that the study of a general inspector in a brain would not be a comment on the convention of the Defense Department of Defense.
However, he said, "The Ministry of Defense has supported the Ministry of Health on this important national security rights in some cases, in some cases, when the public of the Ministry of Defense argues that complex data can be explained, and that the Ministry of Defense supports these important national security features."
The research will increase the risk of developing an American bomb operation in Iraq and Syria (this is the question that the U.S.A. has been discovered by more defense officials the other day).
However, last year, President Obama's question of how much he can trust Central Command for military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and other crisis points.
In addition to the rise of the Islamic Revolution, Centcom's intelligence analyst Gregory Hoooker, President George W. Bush issued a statement that he did not understand enough of a small force in Iraq, and that he did not think of enough work after 2003.
Mr. Hooker also played an important role in the Islamic Revolution.
The authorities said that Mr. Hoooker's team had built temporary retailers to sell oil in the carbohydrates, despite the recent report of Mr. Hoooker's public broadcasting last year.
However, as The Times stated in September, this finding has not occurred outside Central Command.
In the past year of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III's explanation of the war has led to criticism because the war was considered a highly positive assessment of war by many law makers.
General's retired in April, and General Joseph L. Voteel who took his position in Central Command.
The U.S. women who were ready to meet Britain and the United States won 4th victory back.
On Saturday, after Katie Bam was thrown into the 6-1-year-old defeat in Japan, the United States defeated India on Thursday, the first two teams of women in the United States.
He said that while the two games seemed to be a permanent master, Bam (27) said he wasn't sure he didn't do the same thing before.
He said, "I have no idea."
I'm not one of the people who's recording their golfs.
He knows that the Americans share the first line in the Olympic tour at 4–0th and Thursday, after the defeat of Japan on Thursday, with Britain who continued on their way to defeat Japan.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday for the first tour game.
Both teams have the right to date a quarter final, and the game is to determine who's the first and who's going to end the six team bands.
A team of teams who finish their game first won't meet with another group leader, the leader of another group, who is the leader of a group.
But on Saturday, the Americans, after the last 12 teams, created a probation of the London Olympics.
Bam was on this team.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pa., when he first received the bone hockey stick, he was 3 years old (who was interested in this sport in Drexel at the age of 16, and joined the national team.
He missed his 2008 Olympics because he couldn't get into the last paper.
And then he came in 2012 for himself and his team friends.
The next year, a British engineer was brought into service by Craig Parnham, and things began to change.
Bam says, "It's a cultural change of mind, a physical change."
We're not working in London anymore.
We're all over my turn.
On Thursday night, Bam took the first half of the first half of the hit with a reverse hit.
He didn't have a triumph in India yet, but the team was able to protect as much as Bam's ride to the third quarter.
He made a long run from Sahan's soup, and then he threw the ball into the floor, and then the Americans went ahead.
Melissa Gonzales left the final team in the middle of the fourth quarter.
This was the first game in the United States who allowed the first three triumphs in the United States.
Luckily opened up.
So is Bam.
Parnham said, "We're in a good place now, but it depends on how good it is for Saturday.
Trambol's Religion in the Middle East of the Olympic Church
Wherever you are, the Olympics continue.
The activities in Rio de Janeiro represent a competitive competition and work, and it's like it's never gonna end or escape.
It's like a
Simone Billes, Katie Ledecky, or Michael Phelps and Chad can't watch TV, or you can't listen to what your company says.
And there's Logan Dooley.
Among the first time Mr. Dooley, a TV advertising that encourages you to feel good about yourself, may be one of the names of a
However, Lake Forest, from California, Mr. Dooley (28) is fighting for gold medals in the Olympics.
The Olympic alphabet doesn't make any difference in the equal level.
It's far away from the center. There are sports that are not known as universal in the outer shadow: air pollution, oxygen, baddminton, vevando.
It's always gonna be with us, for a long time.
But if I'm personally sure to say I love my favorite, I'd like to pay attention to the secret magic of the tram.
Since the year 2000, it's been known as the Olympic influence I've been using since the year 2000, but a small number of people I've been asking for in the 16th century did not realize that this was a Olympic sport.
This could be a regional shock.
While the United States sent horses for competition, he never won a medal at the tram, and he was not awarded to the finals until 2012.
Men were willing to share their rewards with Chineses and Russians, women and the Chinese and Canadians.
From China to Dong Dong and Canada, Rosie MacLennan will try to protect gold medals in London this year.
However, the trambol is focused on an independent activity, and it may be thought that it is acceptable to the clown school instead of the unknown ears.
I have to admit that I'm not an expert here, I'm only interested in it.
There's a funny potential (like a comical film created by a non-oppressive spindle) but actually reflects the content of the synonymic and the scope of the process that the two athletes have brought together.
The word "Trambolin" comes from the Spanish hand trampolin, which means "tramplen."
The champ Islands are almost 30 feet high in a big tram, and they are asked to make a series of moves (bulkma, poke, and salto).
According to the official Olympic program, they are valued according to the labor, hardship, and "the time of flight."
There are 16 men from 17 countries, 16 men in Rio will fight twice as 16 women.
It's more than the most obvious progress in the Olympics.
Those who hope to buy medals should go back in some situations until they are at the end of the gold range, and in some situations, they should go back and forth, higher, faster and faster.
They don't just follow the finish line or start-up wall, but they also have another hard line on TV; the world or Olympic record.
It's a rare effort, immobilization, and even in the extremely low temperatures, enough to cover a monitor.
But that's one of the qualities I found when watching games.
The trambolin helps you get together all this.
Those in the trams move up.
Targets are not moving forward.
Upstairs, astronaut, get up high, down, down, and back up again.
Of course, it's not fair or difficult, but it's not a good job to reach the end of the course for the end of the course, there's no way to get lost, just to be lost, just like the imagination of time and place.
If it's a Olympic race, it's so interesting.
Women's reviews and their finals will be held on Friday afternoon, Saturday, Saturday, again on Saturday.
NBC will publish the finals every two days as a block after noon.
In the middle of the Olympic culprit, they give a great and wonderful time to be able to look out.
And according to The Wall Street Journal, we can say that if the U.S. American journalists offered to show and make a man's name, Mr. Dooley's new fans will be waiting for the new fans.

In Ethiopia, political changes were met by the government's violent leader.
Witnesses say that a lot of protesters have taken deadly weapons in the conflict with the police.
Is it about to fall on the epiopia?
In the last ten years, one of Africa's most stable nation and fast growing economy was a strong ally for Western.
However, the government's protests against us in the months we've made.
Just the past week, thousands of people were found in the main political decision to get on the street.
According to human rights groups, the government's reaction was extremely cruel.
The Witnesses said that the police had shot a gunouter and killed him.
In the last year of the year, or from the beginning of the year, the Protestant images of the prototype have been seen to be the security officials who have to break their hands against a wall.
The United Nations on top of the top wants the human rights to make a thorough investigation.
"It's always difficult to keep this country together, and it's going to be harder to move."
Ethicia is one of the highest national groups in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is appreciated by West.
There are a few countries in Africa who have been working closely with Ephiopias to fight terrorist threats to Somali at first, and have a small country in Africa who has been helped by West.
Ethicia's economy is growing impressively.
The Altapy has been cured efficiently; it has a new bank train in the capital Addis Ababa.
And the streets are usually quiet, safe and clear.
Even though the best example of democracy in Ethiopia was not exhibited, the members of the country were always forced to take over the pressure of the government, and the country was very limited to the government's pressure.
Most of them were thrown into exile, been imprisoned, killed, or thrown to the remotest regions of the desert.
But this may be about to change.
Seyoum Teshome "If you don't give them any choice without the election from the Protestant."
The youth is in complete Protestant state.
>>uzb_Latn<< A generation is in the Protestant.
There's a lot of complaints about the power of the co-operator in the area.
In the last year, after a lot of criticism, the government party, and the allies, the final seat of opposition, and now the Parliament can control 100 percent.
Moreover, in June, hundreds of people have grown up in the border with the threat and the threat of violence that led to the war that killed hundreds of people in June.
The Analists are afraid that in the years like Oromo Freedom Center or Ogaden's National Security Center, the middle of the year, the division groups are afraid to return from this type of war.
There are a few factors that explain why your painful feelings have been under the surface for years.
First of all, it looks innocent: smart phones.
Just a few years ago, as smart phones spread and the Internet service grew, largely began to communicate with the Ephiopia social media.
When the government repeatedly closed access to Facebook and Twitter, most people were able to communicate with Internet proxy servers that hide their rights.
A few young Ephiopia said they were gathered for protests.
Secondly, the conflict between the two greatest ethnic groups of Ethiopia has increased.
Oroms and Amharas aren't inconspicuous.
For a long time, the pressure of Ephiopia was an act of hatred and cooperation in the lands of Amhara, where most Muslims lived in the Middle East.
But that's changing.
Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromo, said, "We're trying to gather together and cooperate under a spring."
The largest proteins were discovered in Amhara and Oromo regions.
Most Amhara and Oromo believe that Etiyo is not considered to be a part of the ethnic group that created 6 percent of Ethicia and that is under control of military services, economic services, commercial and policy.
The third reason for his independence was Meles Zenawi's death.
The former rebel leader, Mr. Meles, served as Prime Minister for 17 years until he died of an unexplained disease in 2012.
It was thought that everyone saw it, it was a tactical genius.
Analists say that he's an expert on the first signs of peace, especially in order to calm and not damage his opponents.
Mr. Abdi said, "Mevutt regime doesn't have this basic information."
The new Prime Minister Hailemarim Desalegn was chosen to fill Mr. Meles' territory.
Mr. Meles, from the region of North Ethiopia, is south of Mr. Hailemariam.
Analists say he can't afford the security services that he controls the Tigras.
As a result, more blood was shed with fear.
The final experience of epiopia's interdisciplinary disorder in 2005 was a Protestant who followed thousands of Americanists after a military election.
In the situations that followed this, many Protestants were killed less than a month ago, and it's too fast.
High-in-law experts have praised Ethicia's leaders as a new bank train to plan the infrastructure and deal with poverty.
However, it is obvious that the population against Ethiopia did not stop the increase.
And it's a dangerous and ethical situation.
Last month, the protesters in Gondar, a town of Amhara, attacked the people of the Tigrans, and showed a growing hatred for the Tigraans.
Analists say the Protestants left the United States and the other allies in the West in a strange state.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for non-human air aircraft on the neighboring Somaliland, but it was said that the base was closed soon.
He wants to support the West clearly, but he doesn't want this opposition in a region that is still broken.
Mr. Abdi said "this" and he added, "It's like walking on a very nice thread."
Donald Trump explained the Lord of Obama's IRIA's IQUA.
Donald J. Trump, on Friday, repeatedly insisted that President Obama and Hillary Clinton have been trying to remove the last conflict in the United States as they claim it was "the "courts" of the Soviet Union.
This explanation was brought up by new questions about the American People of the Republic of the Republic of Republican.
At the same time, in the process of creating this conflict, he also made a strange statement of what he did to defend the authorities, who tried to tell him that he wasn't.
Mr. Trump insisted that the director and Mrs. Clinton were actually building the U.S. President and Mrs. Clinton on Wednesday night after this suggestion.
But on Friday morning, Mr. Trump said that he was sent by Twitter at early hours, just an admissible statement.
The sender showed Mr. Trump that he was seriously involved in a series of charges.
Hugh Hewitt, Mr. Trump, who wants to destroy the US, said when Mr. Trump tried to help him regain this comment, he didn't believe the President's name.
Mr. Trump, after the fall of the ship, was the last time he was trying to change his camp room.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton, this week, they had a conversation with each other about the economy in Michigan.
On Friday, Mr. Trump wanted to return to this.
Speaking about Twitter again, Ms. Clinton said that the taxpayers will increase, and he found his speech boring.
Mr. Trump used the violence defense before.
After the end of July, after a vision of the Russians proposed to find Ms. Clinton's e-mails in the attack, he explained, "Of course, I said it was a crime."
This approach helps Mr. Trump to force political conversation boundaries and step back where he needed.
"It's an order to "make sure that it is understood" by those who are using the language they use for both candidates.
However, he also knows that these brains are known and that he's too limited to filter when they look at different angles.
After we went down in the evenings, Mr. Trump was my place to clean up the air for the general election church.
A new NBC/ Wall Street Journal/Marst alert revealed that Mr. Trump's North Coraline, Virginia and Colorado had a long race in Florida.
Whatever Mr. Trump is usually guilty of, he is guilty of breaking the words of those who accuse him of being turned away from his fault.
However, in the last few months of the president's campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes are under heavy pressure to support him.
The former New York City mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani did his best to defend the island on Thursday, one of the leading supporters of Mr. Trump.
When Mr. Trump asked if Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton were trying to establish the pace of the Islamic Revolution, Mr. Giuliani said, "I think he's doing a political order."
When it came to view, there was a small organization, not known before Obama, who had been known to find them, was completely wrong and because of the failure of the soldiers to withdraw from Iraq.
Most members of the Republic are trying to defend what Mrs. Clinton has done in the Middle East and is trying to defend the cause of the U.S. growth.
Prior to the meeting in Pennsylvania on Friday, the news media continue to hit every word from Trump Twitter and to blame him for taking action against him.
He said, "They can't do it by laughing at the rich, bitter, bitter experts who try to solve himself."
Some Democrats argue that it is evidence that this is not appropriate for the president.
Once again with the prices and the Chief Canyon Greenpoint
In Williamsburg, the old psychiatry who only worked with cash, was offering a wonderful coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, Bedford couldn't go to the store in Owen's store.
In the book 2014, the store of Verbs sells soap in the Black Cherie cup of cake.
The inhabitants of the region were close to say that this was the last loss of this city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote this to Twitter, "I know it's changed, but I still know that CBGB is leaving and Chelsea Hotel's being released and Verb is now a soap store."
But New York is the city of re-creating as much as the change.
In late November, a Verb Cafe was released in the north of Greenpoint, less than a mile away from the original conversation.
He has a new Verb Cafe Wi-Fi connection, and he accepts credit card, but he's protecting some old employees and similar air.
And coffee's still good.
At the start of the new Verb, the former cage's long-term employee, is also the Cisco Rodriguez, who has the owner and general director of the new cage.
He joined Verb in 2001, and he's still left for the end.
A client said he'd be excited to do it when he offered himself a financial for this new place.
Mr. Rodriguez (36) left the same thing.
Verb uses the same design for symmetrics and bought an espresso machine from the same model.
Even old Verb's lights were re-used here.
But Mr. Rodriguez said he wanted some change experience.
He added new materials.
The pastry-sized sandwiches are available in the menu, and they are also given materials such as cassari and soluble.
Esmer-principal papers.
Cafe doesn't serve beer anymore, but she offers fresh fruit.
About nine months later, Mr. Rodriguez said that former citizens were beginning to come in a determined way.
He said, "Many of our old clients couldn't deal with prices in Williamsburg."
On Monday, Rebecca Olivera was one of these clients.
Mrs. Oliveira (34) lives in Williamsburg and went to Verbs.
After moving to Greenpoint, he didn't give up on this road.
He said he'd been looking for coffee for a while after the closing.
He said, "What I love is coffee and culture in Verb."
Now he started drinking coffee, but he chose a new blonde mix instead of the ice cream that went through the other day.
Tom Rosenthal, who was another advocate, went to Verb since 2003.
He went there before, and he always ordered the same order.
He said, ‘I would enter it [each] day, before dawn, and I would go in it [all] day to make its interpretations,’ and each day I was preparing for it.
Mr. Rodriguez said he wanted to change and add new materials to the menu.
In these days, Mr. Rosenthal is still taking his usual order, but sometimes she does a little bit of change in her everyday syllables, eggs, and cheese.
Mr. Rodriguez said he wasn't in the soap store where the old place was located.
In fact, soup Cherie's owners offered to make a special soap for Verb, using the cup's cold coffee.
Mr. Rodriguez said, "I think we can still accept this offer."
And Greenpoint's traditional Polish people own this cage.
One of the new clients has translated their manager to Lechölä, and Mr. Rodriguez said he will soon find a field where new neighbors feel better.
There are other advantages of the new position.
The local fruit store wants to bottle and sell the cold coffee.
There's a possibility that the cage could be expanded to the building on a fixed scale.
It's enough for most clients to find old Verbs that they can find their old favorites.
Joseph Whitt was a regular client, and he was very sad when the place was closed.
When the new house opened, Mr. Whitt said you could go in and get the coffee in his house.
He said, "I had to smell this."
The Deprespiration of Crisis Time in "A Square Meal"
In March 1933, shortly after he sat in the Presidential Hall, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
Mr. Roosevelt, who was in his throat, loved to eat souvenishly Avenue, who loved to eat soups like Maryland's chicken soup.
That day, the menu of the day was much more prettier: the tomatoes sauce, eggs, potatoes, and sweet pudding.
Jane Ziegelman said, "It's an act of fighting with those who have been troubled," he said.
Andrew Coe added, "This is a message to the Americans about how they should eat."
The couple who live in Brooklyn Heights, the food historian.
Mr. Coe's last book was "Chop Sue", and Mrs. Ziegelman was talking about the Chinese kitchen in America, and Mrs. Ziegelman was talking about living in the nightclons in the eastern part of the Middle East.
"A Square Meal" is a new book that they work together, published by Harper, relates the history of American foods during the Great Buhran.
They also met with an interview for dinner at Eisenberg Sandwich University, the town where the crisis began in 1929.
As Mrs. Ziegelman (54) ordered cream cheese and olive sandwiches, Mr. Coe (57) chose to sit on a potassium, potassium, potato.
The team found out the order of the reporter's Trulo locker was appropriate to discuss the crisis period.
Mrs. Ziegelman said, "Smoons were very popular."
Earth's pesticide, liver soup, dry pulsar.
These were made of something cheap to spread the material.
Think of what you eat enough food for dinner.
Mr. Coe, he drew his face.
He said, "He must have been sitting in his stomach."
In the past decades before our time, especially in rural areas, the soups in America were open.
Women used to cook food for men working in the farm, and breakfast, lunch, and dinners were served.
"A Square Meal," explains the history of the international lack of poverty.
When Mr. Coe explained why he and his wife wanted to write about it, "this is a time when the food came to the Americans for concern."
The new budget regime was a concern: the mysterious foods, such as the Somuns and the dogs, came to the heart of the main food, and Mrs. Ziegelman said, "It was a wonderful way to get the rest of the food" with a cooling of food."
and fruits, and the abundance of all kinds of fruits.
For years, the meat found at the center of the American food has become an understatement.
It's been said to be interesting for Kalori and food value, and the taste of taste comes up with taste or general taste.
Ms. Ziegelman did research for the book that included the recipes, and he set up a soup meal in the full-fat oven.
Mr. Coe said, "It wasn't a pleasure at dinner dinner tonight."
Mrs. Ziegelman supported this by saying, "It's true."
There's no common point in the fusion of the pesticide.
It's a feature of most house economies.
Between 1923 and 1943, the government's economies of the Federal House Department of Economics, including Louise Stanley, led the government's economies, as the country had never known before.
Tafia and articles have encouraged women to be "satrufactive" in newspapers and magazines, and have given them the opportunity to change their taste for good food.
"A Square Meal" is a feast made from historical lizard lobes.
Put Herbert Hoover's cake, and the answers to the government's openers, like the cake.
He once had food like a million units that he had ever turned into a simple Iowa farm food while he was a child of his own.
Mr. Coe said, "He likes European kitchen, like a salad fish."
She had to put her food in a full-sized dining room, wearing all the clothes appropriate for her dinner.
He was far away from the truth.
If his wife, Eleanor, did not encourage him to be an example of his stomach, President Roosevelt, could have made the same mistake.
According to the book, Ms. Roosevelt's use of a job that doesn't matter with any benefit to the taste of the taste has only begun in the White House, "not the food, but the food prepared at the same time."
After the country was again on its feet, many of the ways of eating food in the crisis were left unsatisfactory.
According to Ms. Ziegelman, the focus of the calorie and the food is on the way to apply the food to food.
When the couple wrote the book, Mrs. Ziegelman said that his mother had learned much from her mother's lunch habits, for example, food never went to the trash.
Mr. Coe said, "He was really afraid to eat her food."
Mrs. Ziegelman said, "He really got sick."
It's been a kremb's case.
After the tables were found in Eisenberg, he and Mr. Coe made a dessert that they were preparing at home: President Roosevelt's lunch.
Ms. Ziegelman said, "It's called a dry plant that's broken and added," and he added, and the most commonly applied, the number of applied to this recipe was a positive name.
There was no dry cream; just a little salt, a little salt, sugar, butter, and soup.
Everybody's been bittened by the brown sticky apple.
It wasn't too bad.
Mr. Coe took the second and third.
He said to his wife, "It'd be nice to have a little bit of a

In 2015, 20,3 per cent was paid for federal tax.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Caine continue to be standardized for financial transparency."
In contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind fake sacrifices to explain the taxpayers he had previously given.
No matter how laws are required, the U.S. president's candidates are a means of offering taxpaying tax agents to the public.
Trump and lawyers from New York, who refused to publish, said that the release of the gentlemen was an observation by the Gerler administration.

President Obama is supporting this offer.
During the last week, Neraska was asked to come to Buffett, who had been active in the Clinton Mitt, who had been active in Omahahahay group there.
Buffet said he was in control of the IRS, and Trump said he was "cooked" from the voters, not the tax trade.
Clinton published the tax agents on the campaign until 2007.

The main investment is a low-income investment fund, and Clinton's family said it was $100,000.

Salt red peppers support fins in Tanzanya
The environments in Tanzania use an unusual method to prevent elephants from entering human area; they throw them into red peppers.
A few years ago, this idea has been confirmed, and the United Kingdom Council of the United States and the United States has been called upon to provide evidence of this; it has begun to teach the use of violence to protect the homes and families of the country in northern Tanzania, not to damage animals.
Most of them used to defend themselves.
On Friday, the World Film Day, known for the preservation of animals.
"We've seen a change of attitude in these communities since we developed the drama set, and now they are more self-governmental leaders who can keep themselves away from the elephants," Damian Bell said.
The first two steps are to keep the last file fries and play the corridor.
When that's impossible, it's called the red pepper cloud.
The soil is covered with red red pepper, and it is put in a concert with a cut-and-fucking fire, and it's only closed to the surface.
When the fire is approaching, my condom opens with a explosion, and it's red pepper in the air.
One breathing elephant is enough to send the air through the air.
The last option is to use a mancin that causes a loud voice, bright explosion.
The Jewish film producer, the Arab "teleby" of Arabs, hit the hotel in Berlin, who removed Israel's phone code - RT News.
A Jewish French film producer in Berlin, Kempinski Bristol, who failed to list the phone code of Israel's hotel in Berlin, led to the Media in the media after revealing that the work was being put into action by the Arab clients.
Clade Lanzmann, who wrote a letter to the German public organization in Berlin, asked for the forgiveness of his letter to the Cambridge Bristol Hotel in Berlin.
Lenzmann tried to find Israel in the list of phone codes that he had just been at the hotel meeting shortly ago.
The country, however, did not take place between governments that could directly search from the room.
In 2016, how could Israel be released and destroyed in Berlin?
It's Lanzmann.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers to call Israel through its own call.
The film producer told the state of the hotel to get an explanation.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer he received was "a shock."
The hotel secretary said that this call was taken by the Kimpinski-Hotels administration.
It caused the film producer to get more angry under this move.
According to Lanzmann, most of our employees wanted to remove the code of Arab and Israel."
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel's German ambassador Yaov Hadas-Handdelsman described this as a “good shame. ”
This situation hit us and surprised us.
It's really a shame.
It's an even greater tragedy that happens in Germany and in such a hotel chain.
That doesn't need to explain.
We're waiting for the hotel to get out of this."
The scene was a large reaction in the community; the people called it a scandal.
Some have accused Kempinski Hotel of the Arab clients of their request to "response."
In another message, near the hotel, it was called "You should be proud" by saying, "You must be found in the Kurfursundam street".
Der Spiegel's report, the hotel said this was the end of the incident, and said that it was "unscribing" from Lanzmann, and he quickly dropped these charges from Lanzmann.
Suddeutsche Zeitung said that one of Kempinsky's representatives had no proper orders to be included in the fast search list.
And now they're adding code.

Hüsselin House: The destruction of the lake depends on the drop of three feet
It's found in thousands of instances of Hüssun, who commented the FETO's execution attempt.
It's the start of the House's interpretations:
As I thought they'd get up in the grave, I'd say, "They can't hurt it for the last 5-6 months, but they can't do it in the command chain."
I didn't know two things; first of all, I didn't know if there was a lot of rain and deep, for example, the 8-year command of the Jandarma General Command and the President of the United States.
Mr. President, who's the most successful winer, who's watching how he's watching, but the most important of these is a secret secret.
They're very hypocrites.
One of the most important evidence of the fact that "it's not the job of a retired citizen like FET."
The CIA's definitely got support.
CIA, this person's got a hand too early.
In 2014, the award said that they met Fuat East and Fetulah Güllen at the house of Vehbi Coach in 1971.
He says that people who are interested in these most of these activities are the closest time of relationship between MIT and the CIA.
Our armed forces paid the U.S. personnel' pay, and a man left this after he didn't remember.
When we find out, we're in 2014.
After Mahmut Bey's writing, there was no lie to it.
Like, Adil's an idiot, isn't he?
I'm wondering who's going to be.
He went to Pennsylvania in the last 25 days before the crash, and two days ago he returned to Pennsylvania.
He's been out of jail 109 times since 2002.
When you get all this together, you need to look into it, and now all of those running away are going to the United States from March 1999 to the United States, where they're going to the United States, they have to go to the United States.
They'll see, they're going to Pennsylvania with a guard.
But there are many people who have been sent to the U.S. to the United States with the CIA.
There are Wikileaks' documents, and it's still a dysfunction, and it's sharing together with CIA.
From there, 15 years ago, the CIA and his connections were made to the official.
I said there's a hotwater pool in Fuatt Avni Pennsylvania two years ago.
The man who works at the Prime Minister is working on Fut Avni.
But the bad thing is, these information went down to the CIA as it fell into Pennsylvania.
The destruction of Gülen's three feet depends on the collapse of the three feet; one of them was creating a friend's rings, and it's still Erdogan's film.
I was saying three feet, a chart support.
The stealing of questions, stealing, stealing, defeat of slaves, has greatly persecuted the support of this patient.
The other two feet, political support, international support.
The international support is still available.
The only thing that's gonna break political support is that Mr.K. and MHP are published by the FET.
After 15 July, "FET" was also used, and everyone's eyes were opened.
He's saying, "I'm not doing it."
I'm with me, Hussein, Bey, these girls have so many different dreams they send me, I'm forbidden, because it's not right to act with dreams."

There were 1 police officers in Nusabin.
According to the article, Selahadddin was fired by police who were working for the revolution in the September Court of Human Rights, with long-term weapons of war.
There was a police officer in the first fire, a police officer was wounded.
Two terrorists have been uncontrollable during the conflict against the cops.
The wounded cop was taken to the Nusaybin State Hospital.
It's operation in the area.
He voted the guards, no TV videos.
On July 15th, private televisions that were important to the public were broadcasting in Turkey, using a technical personnel who refused to fight.
That's the hero's brother Akkaya...
Akkaya, who said that the broadcasting of a broadcasting program in the TRT was the city of my friends, saying, "I've been looking at my friends in the fireplace open from the TRT."
They asked me to drop a gun on my head and cut off the magazines.
I just shut down local TVs.
Then I made them get away from the building by telling them we should go to the bags.
I've spent 20 minutes in the office of Antenses.
He said, "I cut some cables back here, but I didn't touch the magazines."
The Dumbledores did not fail to finish the broadcast in Turkey, he brought the students of Samanyolu TV.
These terrorists were caught by the police three minutes ago.
When the Dumbledore returned to the building, about 1 hour later, they knew that TV broadcasts continued with them, and Akkaya, who told them that it was coming to the end of death, said:
That night, I took the train off at 8:00.
That's our duty.
A friend of mine for the E-develop and the electric system.
We're meeting for tea at 6:00 a.m. we've met, and we've been flying through us.
There were a couple of airlines around the Himatoper.
We saw the lights.
It was probably the non-human airlines that could possibly have seen.
They were flying ahead of the helipcoppers.
I've been there for 11 years, and for the first time I saw that flying so close.
Then a movement began.
When we were looking at the news, we learned that the bridge was closed.
At that moment, our general manager was instructed to visit friends in security at that moment to come to the building.
When we went to the airport to get information, we learned that all of the broadcasts in TRT had dropped down.
After five minutes, the TRTs were cut off.
I called the TRT main commander, but I couldn't reach it.
Our control station said the TRTs came back and started to read the report.
Our general manager, Halil Greenman, wanted the TRT publications to be cut off by the general director.
We're starting to work to cut out the broadcasts from three channels.
We just heard of the Prime Minister's Year of Peace.
The order to end our manager's 'TRT' has put us in a bit of resistance psychology.
We cut up TRT, we heard the helicopter voice in a while.
We went out, he shot all over the land, and everyone was broken down.
We hid a building in the back.
We were 12 of them.
When we got back, the soldiers from the helicopter came in.
A few of our friends got the soldiers.
We're here to make sure we don't leave them alone.
At that moment, I saw that they caught our general manager and his knees.
The soldiers were talking about themselves.
He said, "Let's shoot one of them, they're afraid."
Then they let us all go inside.
The officers started shouting, "Who's responsible for this place, I won't ask again."
'We don't know about one's style speech, we don't know about the committee, but we've come to tell us, 'TRT's complete'.
So there's a resistance.
At that time, I felt that I gave up myself.
I said, "I'm mine."
I stood up without knowing what to do right now.
The only thing I'm thinking at that moment was that he had fire on my friends from the helicopter.
I thought you were a 10-15 friend of yours on the stage, and when I thought they were going to kill us at the end, it was a relief.
The chief of them said to cut all the magazines except 'TRT'.
We've got a system section that we monitor when the local channels move up.
We're getting 80 from 200 local channels out of the room.
I'm thinking this room is here.
There was no national broadcast among them.
If I cut these, and tell them they're all cut up, at least help comes from the outside.
Or as far as I'm going.
We agreed we couldn't get out of there.
I said, "I'm gonna stop it."
I cut off one of the local channel packages.
I cut off the power button that we can watch national channels.
So there was no signal on all screens.
I told them I had to go to the antiseptics to cut it completely.
The commander sent me to an antenna.
I opened the Anten room, one of the soldiers said, "Stop."
It's called me the gun.
"You're going to cut all of you, and I'll kill one of you at the end of it, and you'll be the last one of you."
And now I'll see you're going to be so calm that I'm out of it, and I said, "It's gonna be frozen." I didn't say anything else.
We went to the station, cut off local broadcasts.
We've been through the other antenna.
At the time, I have a system that will come against the 20th national channel.
When they cut the local channels, there were about 20 monoliths.
Our Lord! Help me because they have called my Lord a liar.
They believed in the answers we gave.
They didn't.
That gave us comfort.
They asked where the trauma was after he left Antenna.
I said, "I don't know if I'm a TV broadcaster."
I said, "There's no electricity after the afternoon, if it's worth it, I'd say the team would come.
Actually, he had electricity at the time.
I thought I didn't cut the cribs.
I've been thinking about cutting them off the soldiers.
They're just a little comfortable thinking that the books were cut out.
They couldn't make sense to look at the books.
The group's been waiting for it now.
About an hour later, when they opened TV at the waiting room, they saw the A Newspaper.
He's in, soldier.
He said, "My cousin A didn't cut off the news.
We're here with the commander.
He said, " Stand up."
I'm up.
At that moment, a soldier said, "There's still prints."
He said, "There are channels to publish in Cyprus."
'They're broadcasting through Cyprus, I said we can't do anything.
He said, "Now, after we had written with each other, he raised us up, walk with us."
The Darbecers ran away with the van of Turkey.
I've seen pictures of the soldiers who took me to the bathroom and gave me water.
Three times the fire hits the flame and the fire.
My friends claimed it was the same soldier.
They called that soldier 's love.'
It's probably an end to your military.
They might have tried to get rid of him.
According to Akkaya's statement, Turkey's first police team came from the lake.
When the police crew found out he was helicopters around, the security guards went back to the city and went back to the city.
They're back in 40 minutes.
When the police arrived, he never saw anyone in Turkey's foreign land.
"They're invited to the police, and they said, "We're going to have to go to the building three and four minutes later," said Akkayaa, who said, "We're going to have to go into the building."
He said, "Polis's identity was all over his phones, and they were told to get in."

Heaven's meteorite rain is a stage
According to Dr. Hasan Esenoğlu, Perseid, on August 12, 13th, U.S.
The Esenogus, who said that thousands of pieces would turn out of the sunlights and motion with the effect of "Swift-fort" visible sky rain.
Esennogeneously said that the Esseid heaven was discovered in 1862, and that since the 1990s, it began to be seen again in the world.
"We need to see a visual show from the past, that we can see the sky rain rain in the summer and in the summer," said Perseid heaven.
So, this is a natural visual graph.
He said, "He'll give us a better witness."
When it's cold, they'll make white light.
The Esenogeneous thought that some of the pieces of the sky would fall on the earth during the rain, and it continued:
Perseid temperatures can be made up of 2,000 cents.
Because of heat and heat in the atmosphere, Perseids produce red and hot light in the natural environment.
The International Energy Organization can be found in the writing science, which has been transferred from the Internet to how many heavens have been transferred from the Internet to the Internet.
These data are collected from all parts of the world.
He could be watching all night
Esennogus, who reminds us that the rain speeds about 60 miles [60 km] per second, is better than the north of the sky than the north of the sky.
Essenogus, who announced the rain of more than 100 planets a year, revealed that after Perseid rain, it was a significant natural raining of the Geminid rain on 4-17 December.
Little education, former footballer Erdodog
In the case of this equation, the former football player Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was a prominent member of the State, was awarded more than Fetula Gülen from Texas, a high-level university student and university students.
It's the translation of a sentence from a magazine on the top of the Foreign Policy.
Erdogan, a university graduate, is a very educated and former football player; and Gülen's high school graduate Gülen has been widely praised as an expert, and such articles are often offered in the west.
After that, "Why does America and the West rise in Turkey?" They're trying to explain the sentences that begin with the theme "Why does the Great Erdogan...?"
It is possible to understand that the Western rebellion in Turkey is an event in the days of Erdogan, which appears to be a natural state of Turkey.
In fact, statistically, the first ten years of Erdogan period can be read as a time when the Western opposition in Turkey is reduced or remained in middle.
During these ten years, the European Union and the United States had a good relationship with the United States.
Erdogan's criticism against Israel and Israel is not to show Turkey's attack on the end of the war, and to leave the EU's government, as it is not the government's will, and the government's government's will, as it is, the government of the United Kingdom, and the government of the United States, and the government of the United States, as it is not necessary to bring the government into contact with the United States to the United States.
Come on, when we lose 247 people, and the failure of the United States and the failure of the United States, let's say it's not for us to support democracy until the first talk of the United States and the United States.
Well, how would anyone in Turkey forget that there was no other country in Turkey who had been killed by 11 Charlie Hebdo because he was killed by the government, but a month after which 247 people were killed for democracy had been killed?
How do we say that the presidents or high-level representatives sent a couple of times a year for the emergency matter?
How are we going to visit all the EU and the U.S. Ambassadors to the past visit to the United Nations State Council?
When the attack in Egypt was over two weeks ago, the EU's senior representative, who was forced to take hands with his leader Sisi, who was forced to re-responsion the next visit of Kry, would it not have been a surprise to remind any of the opportunities of supporting the "demracy" in Turkey?
Even now, Güylen has been able to get the Turkish people out of the U.S. to get rid of.
If the background plan I've counted above is added to it, I think it's just a situation where the rising West/American opposition is not just an explanation for Erdogan.
And Erdoğan has not even told me that he's still having an ABD effect...
So we thought it was never a relief.
"You think we're going to play the same radio after July 15th, when you see your people who don't think you're going to say, "We're going to be the only one who's intuitive."
When they saw how this nation had received democracy and democracy, they asked the question, "Where are we burning?"
But the questions you need to answer are so many?
Since becoming a traitor, officers who have been assigned to various cities in various parts of the world and have accepted how to get into the State's status and seek refuge from strangers.
We need to see how we live in a mental disorder and how apostate ones are treating people as treacherous.
When the underwater brains come into the Darbe entry...
Would Turkey have a look beyond Turkey's cities to compare their cities to the cities of Syria?
Why would a officer have bombed his country's parliament?
We should not be suspicious of the fact that we should wait for the right behaviour of the brains of the FET.
The other members, but let's know that everything is not just FET's responsibility.
They also contributed to tragedys that have been found in political conflict, hatred, and hatred.
They don't say they're "right" and they believe that all forms of illegal behavior and even nonsubmissiveness are natural.
When those who hate their people are thrown into the hands of their people, how did they end up with the fire?
The way of democracy, the way we know.
I'm saying something very simple: on July 15, Turkey gave the FET officers to the officers, the officers, the sergeants, and to save democracy.
But behind July 15, 1992-2002; 2002-2012; 2012 and after 2012, there are three periods of time.
There are three changes made in these three stages: economic, social, political.
The social change has been made two major steps: moved from the desert area to metropole, and move these migrations around the city for a long time.
I told you this move was on Wednesday with the metro device of the move.
I also mentioned that metro is the most important social change element.
The second major change in the same path is bridges and roads.
It's easier to understand that the road and bridge brought modernization.
The road will come, economic and social structure change.
We've also changed the political structure.
I've already identified the bridges that took place in Istanbul.
Demirel made the Ice Bridge.
This was the birth of the village movement in the 1960s.
The self continued with the second bridge that we changed to the 15 July City Bridge.
They even show the relationship between the environment and the center.
It's a sign of what kind of social change is being observed.
Demirel and Heal's purpose was to destroy large churches.
His ideal for the center was mine.
The AK Party didn't make the third bridge for years.
Because the move was moving all its speed.
The people were placed in satellite cities.
It was a little closed in those regions.
The AK Party gave people a lot of work, social status, and they voted to the AK Party.
So it was not the center of the continents that they wanted to make their political powers around them and come to the center after the center.
This was about the correlation between the AK Party (1992-2002) and the AK Party.
These arguments have led to the opposition of opposition, opposition, and cooperation of the local people, not of the State.
The AK Party was moved by the way I indicated in 2002, the churches were political, the political floor, made progress.
Now, look out now, it's time for a democracy fight with the construction of the Three Bridges on July 15 July.
So it's history and sociological.
I'll add another size: AK Parti's move is not limited to the Istanbul bridges I'm talking about.
It's interesting: the AK Party now combines the environments with central cities.
It's made up of two bridges.
One, the Ottomangazi bridge.
Two, qualkkale 1915 bridges.
Add the paths to this.

Robert Amsterdam, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (FET) who was questioned by the National Traffic Agency of the International Rights Court of Human Rights, was able to share information about how the U.S. magazine Forbes was organized.
"As soon as Gündelah's organization was established in Pennsylvania, Gullen's study of about 150 words in the U.S. has shown that there is an underlying active organization in the United States."
Amsterdam pointed out that the company and schools have already been assigned by Turkey seven months ago by Turkey, saying that they have already found it "scrupulous."
Amsterdam put these points in his article:
According to information given to us, Gülen has a large population that is given to us.
These instructions are usually delivered at meetings held by Gülen and Poconos in Poconos.
There's a group of seven people on the hill.
This group sends instructions to the consultant.
Teachers are going from here to the district authorities, the country's immigrants, the country's land immigrants, the country's immigrants, the country's immigrants, the country's immigrants, the country's signatures, the country's signatures, and the students' homes.
Business people, bureaucrats, and officers work on different levels according to their position in the organization and support.
Amsterdam, who has received 550,000 jobs in the United States, reported that the U.S. public officials paid millions of dollars each year to pay their taxes.
Amsterdam wrote that the majority of these funds were sent between them, and that the organization was transferred to the "supervised" calendar companies.

In California, the boarded Magnolia schools were arrested while the company was connected to the same office and sharing the same service contract.
Mysterdam showed Dove Science Academy in Oklahoma.
Amsterdam also reported that this school paid more than $31 million of its owner's property, and also found that the company's office and the manager of the government had been identified by the same people who were associated with Gülen.
Amsterdam, who noticed similar conditions in her 46-year-old Harmony schools, observed that similar conditions were found in her home.
"This example of what I gave to the American tax officials shows that about 28 million dollars were used."
He used the expression "the part of what we found so far."
Amsterdam, who has shown that this kind of events have not occurred until now, has become worse in his language, and has reminded all of this, he's starting to explore the demands of the Texas Education Department.
Amsterdam has pointed out that schools are normal, and many employees have not been informed about what kind of corruption they are.
Amsterdam says, "But these schools actually work like a snow machine for the lake."
"He used his money for political forgiveness in order to hide illegal activities," he said.
According to Amsterdam, a former American teacher working in these schools, he explained that some of his employees in the House of Gülen have participated in a particular section of their articles, saying, "They believe that the Grand Forces of the Birds work similar to that of the United States."
Darbe was able to strengthen their position over the years.
"But when the army appears to be working normally, a parallel force was found behind the scene."
Amsterdam finished his article:
In the head of the policy makers in the United States, there's a question mark on 15-16 July and the next event, and that's what's expected.
However, while taking the two firms at the diplomatic level, they need to wake up the fact that the Gülen's operations in the United States have been in constant violations of the laws of the United States.

Be careful about this habit of kids.
Dr. Bilgin Giray said that children can't get enough food for their early age because they didn't have to do it.
Dr. Giray, who has been able to identify the causes of my fingertips.
Most babies are ordered to break up.
She'll put her finger in her baby's womb to give birth to a child who's only 1.5 years of age, and then she's willing to leave her mother's office and relax.
She said, ‘Do not be afraid, ’ and when she comes to sleep, she says, ‘I think it is difficult for me to be patient,’ and when she leaves, she says, ‘I will be able to put my fingers in a manner that I will not be able to wear.’
In addition to the lack of confidence and trust in parental relationships in the age of age, Dr. Bilgin Gyray explained the effects of this behavior:
Immigration is a positive effect in the development of a child's teeth.
The pressure that comes up during the embassy occurs when the above teeth are raised up, and the lower teeth are then cast back.
This leads to the back of the sub, breaking the balance and the balance of the tooth structure.
It's a physics reflection, which means that the speech decay and the closedness look worse than the plastic opening.
"We can protect our children from closed and adding problems, when there is no solution."
"That's why children today must be under control of the mouth structure, such as the eyes and hearing control.
It's a new wave in the nearby treatment: Trifookal Lens
Carthakt treatment does not want to use glasses as natural.
Over the years since our patients have been able to solve this problem.
In recent years, twentiethical mercenaries and the success of the treatment in this area took another step further.
Trifacal lenses are not only a distant distance or distance, but also a good way to get a clear view of the distance between distance and distance.
>>uzb_Latn<< The treatment of remote, close, or distance distance
The distance between sight disorders represents a very often used in our daily life.
For example, the showing panel of cars is the distance that we're holding in our ear, where we're holding computers or 60-70 cm.
Since the trifoxyl lenses are correct, they don't need to use any means of keeping our patient close or far away.
Another advantage that trifactors have made is that of reducing night complaints.
Dr. Volcan Hürmeric "There is no difference in the normal treatment of the temporal lenses used for every distance treatment treatment."
The treatment we use will help our patients with a calm and comfortable health for a 10 - minute procedure.
And the next day, our patients can return to their normal lives.
It is particularly an operation for those who use a car, who likes to read, and who likes to read and live more efficiently.
You can also apply this procedure to finding out whether you are appropriate for any patient under 18 years of age.
It's not used in the Valerie heart surgery!
Wearris is a very common disease in recent years.
The existence of genetics is a priority; long work hours, long work hours, and the increase of long-term health complaints.
Are the veins used in heart surgery?
I have a lot of risks, what if I'm having a heart attack in there, what are the questions that people are often curious about?
Here's the answers to these questions.
There are two types of soils on the leg:
There's a system of deep soils that we're bringing dirty blood into wastes and collecting vital blood from your leg.
These are the deep femoral vaccine and the female femoral.
The problems in these units are more rare, they don't close the walls, and they apply medicines to keep the walls open.
There are hundreds of subunits in the body that we're bringing dirty blood into wastes and bonding with the deep soil system.
This system consists of two major and two species called small salaries.
There are four of these veins, and the legacy can grow.
The soils that are used in heart surgery are found in the surfaces of a large syllable.
They don't have any damage in the body, so they can use heart surgery.
But for these veins to be healthy in the heart surgery, they must be healthy.
Because the heart is a very important organ.
They can also reduce the load of heavy veins or leave them in the laser, lowering the weight of the deep soils, and improve your leg's healthy.
A false belief among the nations can be used as a backup.
The wheel will never be used in heart surgery!
There are other walls that can be used in heart surgery.
The digestive system that can be used in heart surgery is found in the body, under the chest cage, within the brain, and in the arm.
So it's impossible to wait for the heirage to use to the heart, and worry about it.

While closing the British gold, Scott Calum Skinner's flying home
While the Great British Team was protecting its title from London in 2012, the Spanish Calum Skinner was running for the night in the race by the men.
Glasgowlu, 23-year-old raceman, raised this legend as Sir Chris Hoy's leading mission, and made it proud of the young man who was returning home with his new Zelana dress.
It was four years ago that Hoy took five of the Olympics from six Olympics, Britain had a shock victory.
And even though Hoy was retired, they finished the World Champion in March, at the sixth stage in March.
The problem between science and London was the change of Jamie Staff.
That's exactly what Hindus did when they came out.
Hoy's retirement also created an empty space where Kian Emad and Matt Crampton tried to fill it.
He's seen Scott's potential now, and the British terrorists didn't give up Skinner.
Four years ago, he and Hoy had broken the Olympic record in the tour of the Olympics, Kenya and Skinner, but in the first round, New Zealand was re-engineed.
And the British three went to the Willo for gold.
And even though he's a little behind his own tour, Johnny came forward, and Skinner stood up for it.
It was a big change in this strategy that allowed Hundis to slow himself down, especially for Kenya and Skinner to keep up.
Hoy watched them as an expert writer of the BBC, and when they got out of the studio, Skinner, Kennedy, and Hindus were attracted to him.
"It's an honor-like match to a Glasgowlu, 23-year-old Skinner said,"
I'm just here to do the best I can and hear my name.
We broke the Olympic record and defeated the world champions.
That was really amazing.
There's no better way to win this.
He confessed that after winning a victory with Johnny and Hoy in 2012, he fell in the dirt.
Later, he responded to this comment, and there was no way of finding Britain's opponents.
This time, it wasn't a problem for an incredible victory.
Heines said, "It was like in London with all the Great Britain flags in the United States."
We're just a set-up team three months ago.
We've lost a lot of world competition so it's really amazing to win back in Olympics.
It's just one thing for a nation that won seven of the 10 contests in Beijing and London.
If this has been measured in the last five months, he's waiting for us five more days to succeed in the race line.
What Kennedy's mine says is that Hoy's retraining three gold dollars in just one Olympic is not impossible.
This means that he's only 12 years old from Hoy, and he is 23 years old (also 23rd March, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister's birthday, and the British sport history) is going to reach a gold medal and a gold medal.
That means the same level with Hoy.
Johnny, he's going to the sprint race after that, the race will start today, and he'll take three days.
28-year-old Boltonlu said, "I'm just enjoying it.
Team activities always have the best activity.
You can win with your friends.
To be honest, when you win alone, you feel lonely.
And Hindus said, "If the gold is better than gold, the knight should be given to the knight."
It's just the effect of the medal today, but there's a lot of good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, and Owain Doll completed their first tour of four miles away.
They're finished at 3:51.943.
The world record that won gold medal in 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first tour and final (22:42) will be set in the second section and will be given all attention to Wiggins.
Earlier in the study tour yesterday, the authorities had an agreement with the officers when he called him to measure his neck.
During the activity of women who are going to continue, Laura Trottt, Joanna Rowsell, Elinor Barker, and Milligavie, Katie Archibald 4:13.260.
Great Britain has confidence in a strong bike team to take the knees in the middle of the Olympic Games and to win a lot of medals.
Following the rise in Beijing and London, the expectations were very slowed down in Rio.
In the background, technical director Shane Sutton has also experienced many bad developments that include the use of the name in April and Hoy and Victoria Pendleton as a result of sexual crimes.
But the first night after the competition on the beach, it shows that Great Britain will be able to prove again when he's finished the perfect time.
The Enerji agreement is a suspect of the future of the Portuguese curse.
In Victoria, the Portuguese scientist's office is coming and hundreds of workers have been in the process of revealing the failure of the power supply of energy to make sure that one of those who have the tessal contracts to get the answer to the locker of all the temporal contracts.
This move appears later in the beginning of this year that the Victoria government has decided to increase its progress in order to maintain the facility of the facility.
The 20-year-old firm's time is full in November.
It could be under pressure by 2000 at Alcoa's Portland facility.
Any closed operation can cause a total of 2,000 of your job to risk risk risk risk.
And the report can also have effects on how far Victoria's electricity is destroyed by 10 percent.
In 2014, Alcoa Point Henry shut down the trail of the trail, and this led to the closing of the Anglo-Electa energy base last year.
Alcoa's Portland track is losing money and against closed risk.
These progressions appeared in a few years after the rise of the Australian Navy and a few years prior to the loss of air pollution.
The AGL that supports power from the Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley indicated that the other three owners would expect their contractions to take place.
Most of the Tessines belong to Alcoa and Alumina's associate office, and China's CIIIC, Japan has smaller parts of Marubeni Corp companies.
"AGL expects the Portland facility to continue, which means that the student's valve will continue to be physically electrical demand."
The AGL said that the contracts should be entered through November 2016, "science regulatory contracts."
Since the contracts have a 12-month period, they will end in 2017.
"That's why, AGL, the contracts will continue to be in agreement for 2017," said the Energy firm.
The effects of AGL's 2018 Mali Year and the following potential profit are limited to a strong contract for power prices from the ball.
The AGL indicates the value of the contracts in their accounts now over 187 million dollars.
Alcoa said, "Alcoa doesn't have the ability to use the light of a fire or to maintain electrical control over the ocean."
The U.S. company signed a 20-year contract in 2010, and this agreement was not to explain why this agreement had not been made in November but why it had not been fulfilled since this year.
Analysisists are critical because of the possibility of the economic problems of the Tomago facility near the Portuguese Ocean and the Newcastle.
At the beginning of this week, the AGL was responsible for the operations of the researchers, Stephen Mickels, Ireland's nearly 600 megawatts, also made 900 megawat energy.
In the case of both of these facilitys, the demand [electric] will cause them to fall in value.
And as a producer, that won't be good for us."
It's not just the star of the Cardasian TV program; Kendall is on the cover of Vogue's annual number
The fourth daughter of the model and manager Chris Kardashian-Jenner group, Kendall Jenner (20), is on the cover of four Elections waiting for the US Vogue.
Kendall, who was a secretary of an Estee Lauder Center and who was married to Milan, Paris, and New York, heard this report from the Instagram account on Thursday.
Kendall said, "I cried when I looked at this cover in a room full of people I loved."
After the closing, the entire Cardassian-Jenner family (also called Rob and Caitlyn's favorite show) was taken from the world of Rob and Caitlyn and everyone's favorite show, Ryan Searest (and just Keeping wikicrest's wiki program) and then the video came to the end of the video game, which was the final one:
While this was almost all children's video gameline for television programs, it was not until morning (and at 8th, "Do you think we've forgotten you?" Kris, saying, "Do you think we've forgotten you?"
Of course we're in a new Karadishian period with this development of Vogue's September number.
Kendall's sister, Kim, could have passed her on to the Vogue gate (and shared her wife with Kane West in April 2014), but the September opening was a major success.
Vogue's annual number was the greatest sales of the year.
This number led to the attention of many advertisingmen (Fashiontista, last year's 832 pages 615).
It's also a process of revealing the closed star; the pictures of the magazine that we've spent two years have been leaked before.
Among the women who had been placed in the park are Naomi Campbell, Linda Evabesta, and Kate Mos.
In recent years, the cover has been placed in the "governmental models" of "constructured models."
>>uzb_Latn<< Oscar awarded Diaror took place in 2013, and the next year, this honor was introduced to Lady Gaga.
However, in the case of Mrs. Jenner's first cataloging, known as "the "preparable model", it is said to be very good.
These famous people are not young people who know how to take a title of famous people or what they're doing, but they're not young today's kids (or Jenner all of these).
They're all women who've got their talent in the entertainment sector.
Beyonce, located in the close of the last year, spent one of the best times of his career with Lemonade's exit.
Of course not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Because of the Realite show history, Genner's position in the fashion world will always be disturbing.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model introduced Stephanie Seymour, Jenner, and his fellow worker Gigi Hadd, to criticize them.
When Jenner's news came out of Vogue's cover, he went back to his face again.
But focusing on satisfaction seems hopeless.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue's September Number.
He's a super model of the word.
He's heading out to Marc Jacobs's.
Estee Lauder's taking you from the background.
He and his sisters sell their own paintings on the wall walls for you.

Global health support centers turn 1,000 people back every year.
While the sector is now being prepared to create more financing operations that are still under the influence of the national security cuts, the nation's most secure cuts from the national government's security centres.
In Queensland, three of the five (one-year-olds, refugees, non-supervised workers, violent business decisions, and unjust decisions, and those who are not content to fight their legal decisions.
The public health support services that have been destroyed have been prepared for further completion.
From June of the next year of June, it is planned to eliminate more than 30 percent of the federal fundraising centers.
The Queensland Director James Farreel, a member of the United Kingdom, said that thousands of people were returned every year in the national Rapor.
Mr. Farrel said that the federal government would be worse if the government did not get back.
He said, "Queensland's public health support centers are incredibly independent of the same way, which means that thousands of people are unable to reach their needs," he said.
People who are involved in violence, those who fight against the power and corruption of the system of things, and those who fight in the way of separation, are not able to cope with the problems that all of these rights are involved in, and this report does not help them.
The federal government means that thousands of Queensland residents in the area will be able to cut their financing from June to 2017 at least 30 per cent.
We invite the Justice Minister and Queensland Senator George Brandis to return this financial agreement to the end of this financial crisis when people are facing a legal problem.
Last year, the government fulfilled the promise of bringing the government to the national average firm.
Now we have to look at the fundraising of public legal support centers and the funding of the Palazczic government who serves it.

>>uzb_Latn<< The level of control is again in the Commission
Turkey, who was expected to enter into the world's largest funding, was removed from the law of silence.
It was decided to be re-induced from the review mechanism of the function, but was re-induced from any change.
The CHP National and State Council of the United States of America and the United States of the United States said, "We're not going to be afraid of being taken from public propertys, from employees, and from the employees, for the non-profit funds of the work"
Turkey War Fund offered a law on Sunday, in order to provide a long-term resource for the investors and projects.
However, the AKP offer today has brought it back to the Plan and the United States Commission.
The CHP member of the TBM Plan and the United States National MHP, told CHP about the concerns and concerns of CHP regarding the Vari Fon law.com.
"When it comes to the establishment of this fund for the Plan and the Federal Commission, our former Minister, Minister of the CHP, asked for our interests and concerns, asked for a request, and offered it as an alternative.
The government who accepted our opinion has brought the project back.
It's the same thing as the tax is back to the Commission yesterday.
"The government seems to insist on removing it from the Meclis in a week."
"Our greatest concern in this law of the law is not to be independent."
"The owners of the government are coming from the unemployment fund for the workers to be taken by the employees, who will be paid for their jobs, who will be paid for their jobs, will be paid for by the State and the National Council's Committee, and who will not receive any responsibility," he said.
"But we have an organization open to us, but we have a clear understanding of the Russian, China and Körfez countries that have more oil products and more than trades and that the fund has a financial basis for this kind of funding."
That's why the fund will be made from public sources, so the people's money will be paid.
The total of 100 billion dollars in the unemployment fund is planned to transfer over 100 billion from a national retirement fund that is forced to work.
He said, "It's gonna be a complete deal with the people's money, of course, and it's not worth the money," he said.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture argues that the state's resources were not accepted except by the Meclific administration of the state, and that the Vari Fonon law said:
The gathering of such a large population, business and operations that are paid to its public reputation, is not limited to the management of independent management companies.
It's also required to have public control and to make a transparent design.
In the Law offer, the Variance Fun has no authority over the constitutional institutions and transparency.
There was no limit to how much resources to transfer.
No one will ask the account about how this fund was used.
The goal of the game is to make big projects financial.
There's no need to be an unsatisfactory background for that.
Why don't you get in the budget?
And when it comes to intelligence, it's natural to the minds, "Why do you escape from the SAA and the Meclists administration?"
He said that they were not willing to transfer money to investors while they were together in debt, but that they were not transparent, that they were working with non-official mechanisms, who said, "That can be argued."
But if the government insists on it, then we have to make sure that other countries of such investment funding are established in Turkey.
It has to be configured in a manner that is brought into charge mechanism.
There are no Shames on it, the amount of money used by the citizen must be set up to pay up his account until the end of his money.
"We're glad we're listening to our criticisms after the 15th July meeting of the Council, especially on July 15th.
In this law offer, we hope that the AKP will listen to our creative investigations.
We're willing to argue that the national beings are being used as a means of transport, that those who use it are not subject to being inconspicuous, and that's not public control.
He said, "It's the Lord's Fun, but if these concerns are gone, it can be useful."
It's found that there was work done to ensure progress between AKP and AKP.

Britain has to channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathhow
Heathrow is not only in our local community and in London, but in the country.
I think it will bring Heathrow in a very attractive effort to get all these nationals and districts to benefit from the games.
The Olympics, Stratford, and East End have made large advantage for the End.
And we'll do it again by creating opportunities for the local community and firms near Heathow.
Only 10,000 new stations for our local community will create a new job, and we're not going to leave a busy young boy around the airport.
As in London, as in 2012, those who think he's going to have a lot of pressure to expand Heathhow.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for games, and we're going to be dirty all over the world.
Those who heard were wrong in 2012, and they're going to see it wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles that should be overcome, but Heathrow answers all the questions asked.
As in the Olympics, Heathhrow is a project for a lot of people, not just a few people.
8,000 new jobs and 211 billion economies have left many skills and jobs around the United Kingdom.
We have a wonderful team that uses the best airflow in Heathow for five years (the best airline terminal in the back) to T2 to the worst two badest times of the world, and to apply a infrastructure at 1 billion centimeters on budget.
Now, we're ready to offer a third site that supports a private investment with 16 billion dollars.
London 2012 was a great success for the United Kingdom, and I doubt it would be the same.
It's time for us to make sure that we're going to make a lot of skills and work that Britain will be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the president of the Heathhrow Board and the former Caesar of the Prisoner of Ticarri
Adblock Plus, Facebook advertising game like "like a-fre game"
According to one of the companies who contributed advertising companies to prevent advertising software from advertising companies, they understand the "key-fare" game.
On Thursday, Facebook released a blog that said that Facebook's advertising would prevent visitors on the desktop site only two days later, Addlock Plus said that users could update their filters to the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook said that advertising would change the codes around us to determine which part of the page is advertising.
But Adblock now says he's solved the new codes.
One blog writer Ben Williams wrote that "from the time of the development of an open advertising group of people who try to prevent it" and that, in the near future, Facebook could produce its own solution.
The world's largest social media company is going through this struggle, showing how much concern the advertising contributors have for the sector.
According to one study of Pagefair and Adobe's work last year, nearly 200 million people use advertising, which is four times the number of people used by this type of software in 2013.
Facebook is now creating 84 percent of Facebook's advertising sales with mobile devices.
According to one dictionary, mobile advertising manufacturers have been led by Facebook's mobile applications and instagrams for social network, since it is not effective for the company's company.
Facebook's worth this move, so the desktop advertising should still be available.
On Tuesday again, Facebook announced that people would update the "real preferences" tool so they could be able to control their advertising.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed Adblock was worried about new filters, and the advertising company on the site would prevent some of them from entering the site.
One Facebook speaker said, "It doesn't give people a good experience, and we're planning to take care of this problem."
The retailer is an acquiescent tool, so we are focused on creating tools such as Reclam Preferences to help people manage.
A woman ran into Switzerland's bus; it looks like suicide.
The victim was sleeping in the highway at midnight.
The police are looking for people who witness a couple of cars that hit women in the highway early on Thursday, showing suicide.
The event came to challenge A1 near Morges near the Vaud Canyon after midnight.
Vaud's police said that a woman was lying on the ground in the darkness of the night and hit a few cars.
He hit several cars, including a 49 - year - old Swedish woman who wanted to kill himself.
He lost his life at the scene.
The police suggested that a few of the passengers were involved in the incident, but some of them didn't recognize, and everyone involved in them and their events wanted to apply them.
The lawyer Giles Hoffstein explained to Le Tribune de Genev that "the name of a punishment in such situations" was revealed.
However, the driver involved in the event is not yet aware of whether or not the driver will face any crime.
Was it possible to escape without an attack?
He said, "That's what the prosecutor should determine," Hoffstein said.
Two similar cases in the past five years indicate that drivers are not responsible.
Both cases in the newspaper (and both in the dark) were decreed that the driver should not wait for a fire in the middle of the night.
Last year, in August 2014, a police officer who hit Paynerne on the road near his death in August 2014 found no reason to cause his death.
In court, 22-year-old victim was drinking and he was on the road.
The court said that a police officer who responded to an emergency call was using the car in a reasonable manner and that a man found on the road was "material and unsatisfactory".
The report on this event on Thursday, Morges, is to call the police from 021 644 83, 46 or 021 644 44.
NASA teaching model: Venus was suitable for living at a time
According to the estimate of the new NASA climate model, there were once circumstances in Venus.
NASA Goodd Space has developed a model to explore the history of Venus, using similar tools and algorithms that scientists use in the Institute of Sciences.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus had a home with a full surface, hot, waterless atmosphere, and CO2 were once designed to ensure that he did not have a home for similar conditions on Earth.
Science has been trying to explain the low speed of Venus in the past.
But the new estimates suggest that Venus could have a nice atmosphere like Earth and can still return slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of the old Venus.
Even though the planet has more dry regions than Earth, it may have once been able to protect itself against water and climate change.
The old Venus also had a greater advantage over 30 percent of the sun.
GISS said, "In the process of the GISS model of the GISS model, Venus has been able to return to the sun for almost two months," he said.
This led to the raining winds that were moving against the surface of the surface of the sun to provide rainwater that would protect the surface of the sun.
As a result, there were only a few degrees of colder climate temperatures since the Earth is today.
The model has made it possible for the planet scientists to create a similar story, as evolutionary hypothesis.
Despite all the conditions that have been set up for life, Venus has had a lot of heat and ultraviolet light in a few billion years.
The oceans are evaporated, and the water is destroyed by the ultraviolet light.
The hydrogene's out there's only a carbonyl gas effect that has a carbon dioxide effect; so today's what we know about is Venus.
The researchers shared the results of the new Venus climate model in Macades.
Patrick Roy used the Avalanche antenna
Patrick Roy announced that the team didn't have the right to decide, so on Thursday, Colorado Avalanche was released from the presidential mission and hockey operations.
The Colorado leader/General Joe Saquic agreed to make this progress, and the club's club would immediately start looking for a new engineer.
"For the three years we've been in the brain, I've fulfilled my duties with energy, passion, and determination," said Roy, 50-year-old.
I've been thinking about how I can improve this suit for the summer and how I can get a higher level.
To accomplish this, coach and VP hockey operations need to be in perfect sleep with the structure of the organization.
And the decisions that affect the team's performance must also have the right to say.
These conditions are not yet met.
Roy was a member of the team on May 23, 2013, and he thanked Roy for his contribution to Roy.
"Patrick knew about my decision today."
We thank him for everything he has done for our salvation, and we beg him for a chance in the future.
Roy was the best coach for Jack Adams Award in 2013 with Avalanche in 2013.
The club won 112 points and made the team finish the first round, but Colorado was newly updated to Minnesota in the first round of the slide-of-off period, and was later released in two years.
Avalanche reached 39-39-39-4 in 2015 and took five points for the second company in the West Conference.
The Queen Roy in the honor list has won four Stanley Cups, both of the Montreal Canadiens, for Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue to meet the meetings by taking the grevy
Because of the payment of the North Sea oil workers, the head talks for a new meeting tour.
Petrol field services are used as a basis for the platforms in the North Sea of the North Sea against Wood Group.
"We decided to start the process for the current agreement as the Wood Group and the United States and the RMT joints," says a central brain.
In the next few weeks, we're going to arrange a series of sessions for a whole day to take a fresh look at problems from the beginning of the next week.
The workers said that this protein has been the first action since 25 years since the wages of 30 percent.
Wood Group, this year, in the market, has completed nearly 9% of the payloads on the transporters in the North Sea.
In 2014, 10 percent of the sales of the company were applied to the taxpayers in the country.
The company said that he would provide the company what he needed to take in order to get through the difficult times in the market.
Shell, British energy company BG Group, took thousands of people out of work, and heard plans to leave oil and gas operations in the country until 10th.
Energy companies are all under pressure because of the economic conditions of the European Union in June.
Dave Anderson, member of Scotland Parliament, will discuss one of the biggest business conflicts in the North Sea by meeting the workers at the beginning of this week.
As he says, the North Sea is important for the regional economy.
He said, "We need an effective economy, not for the poor and the country, but for the majority," he said.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion investors were expected to invest less than $1.4 billion in the North Sea in the last five years.
Kepler measured the conversion rate of stars in the country team.
The Capeler space telescope helped to create at least the speed of the stars in the Milky Way of the United Kingdom.
The new data helps us to understand why the stars in the team of galaxies change and how the transformations are affected by the planet's rotation.
Louis Reull, a researcher at Caltech's Red Center in Pasadena, said, "When we compare our stars to stars, we hope to find more information about the history of a star, old and even the history of the solar system."
The country team star is 445 light years away from Earth.
Most of the stars in the team star have been born 125 million years ago, and new growth levels have reached the level of growth.
They're returning to the highest speed of life.
When tepe returns, stars in this development stage are formed in a large amount of stars.
These winds have a negative effect on stars as they grow in magnetic fields.
As a star grows older, they start to fall.
The Kepler calculates the speed of each star's conversion, which can be seen by observing the time between the visible stars.
The last return speed suggests that the larger stars return faster than the smaller stars.
The Lord, like the dancers, means that the big ones are doing their feet slower than those who are small.
Reull said, "We see that those who slow down in the field are more difficult and faster, but those who turn fast."
Since the country's team star is close, it is seen to be an ideal cosmic lab task to compare the properties of stars with their properties.
Rebul said, "It provides theoretical models for the stars as young and old as they are both young and old."
There's much more to learn about how the stars turn, when and why they fall, why they left their "denses shoes" on a corner.
In a short time, Rural and colleagues explained their new analysis of the national team's conversion rates, as opposed to the three new articles that will be published at the Astronomy Library.
