>>uzb_Latn<< Last minute: Our Cosmic Visitor Dev Asteroit 2014 JO25
When the sun falls on the solar system and hits it, there are billions of giant galaxies that can cause serious consequences.
It can sometimes pass through Earth, where the sun has closed or open orbits from the Sun.
Asteroit 2014 JO25, a visitor and a visitor today, is about 1.75 million miles away from Earth's closest place.
As the day went by, we've been able to hear the news more often.
That's the most important reason they're on the visual techniques and the development of observation tools.
So we have the ability to identify small asteroids that are not yet defined.
In January, for example, an asteroid Earth and moon travel only a distance (~250 kg) of the Moon.
And only a few days ago, the interesting asteroid has been identified.
I mean, there could be other cosmic buss coming to us right now.
What do you do if you know that you're in the middle of the neighborhood that you're in the middle of 20 meters?
In fact, the asteroids in this size will not destroy your neighborhood, but it's probably going to explode the windows of all the buildings.
This will also be due to the shock waves that will be released from asteroid to the atmosphere.
For example, in 2013, the asteroid was on these sizes, and it was enough to block the windows of buildings in several cities.
But if you're in the target of a asteroid at 100 meters, you're at least 50 miles away from your advice.
It's the ones that determine the depth of the cerebral cortex and the damage it will cause.
According to the report of the European Space Agency, let's take a look at several scenarios.
If an asteroid hits the Earth with a 100-centimeters per second, about 250 meters per second, and a kilogram is about 250 meters deep and 12,000 meters wide.
So, according to the Richard scale, it's worth 6 times equal to the earthquake, and if you're ten miles (10 km) of the crash point, you're going to have 3 degrees negative.
They're 50 miles away, and they'll be waiting for the window windows to be broken.
If it hits an asteroid on a distance of 1 km, the situation will be more inner-sized.
If it hits the Earth with the same angle and speed, it's about 600 feet deep, and it's about 12 miles across the Earth.
I mean, it'll turn into a big semester and it'll be destroyed.
Even if you're 100 miles away from the point of damage to the resulting rate, you're going to have a negative negative effect on your body.
It's worth 8 times equal to depression, according to the border Richter scale.
The damage that the asteroid will give it is also related to the rock structure of the region that will hit the chemical compound, not just the chemical compound.
The above values are taken from the script when an asteroid is formed into a region that is made up of a solid rock.
If an asteroid is mostly composed of iron, then if it falls into a surface with the heat of the laser, the gravity will increase three times, and it will also occur as a result.
About 66 million years ago, there was something worse to dinosaurs, and there was a disaster due to an asteroid crash that was about 10 miles [10 km] across.
The ansteroid hit was destroyed by 75% of the sea and black animals.
Make sure that a great asteroid is targeted by the Earth if it's targeted by the dinosaurs.
He's falling into the Earth every day from space.
Most of these are burning in the atmosphere.
Some of the major galaxies that have enough are caused by light in the atmosphere, causing the stars to disappear among the people.
Let's end up with another news to comfort us.
The studies show that for the next 300-400 years, a giant asteroid is expected to hit Earth.
I'm sure the average has been living living for 70 years.
Fladia for Medel: 10 million euro!
Gary Medel, who wants to join the Stoper zone, has clearly looked forward to leaving the Black-Beysters' birthday...
He's 30-year-old footballer, who's 30-year-old, who started working with the Inter.
He suggested that Gazzetta dello sports, as well as the front libio area, would offer a ten million euroscience proposal to the Inter.
While the black-Beysters were expected to respond to Medel, the Shili football player was forced to live with his family in Istanbul.
It's hard to pay 10 million euro for Gazzetta's claim against this claim.
The black-Beysters first have an opportunity to enter Mel's car while he's going to a very serious truck, like Caner Erkin's transfer.
Five five reported Negredo transfer
The human rights group warned for the Missource
For the sake of the national coloured people, the State's separate policy and race attack was a warning to the people who would travel to Missouri.
"In the end of August 28, 2017, African-American travelrs and Missosuris have shown special needs and needs, due to the fact that they are expected to travel from the past to the end of the country, as shown in the preceding article," the group reports.
NACP said that a new Missouri law forced people to win their separate cases, and at the same time, the state's government's legal applications were affected by this travel warning.
"There are human rights that happen to the people.
They're being stopped because of their skin's color, being beaten and killed." "Dansan City Star to NASA NACP President Rod Chapel.
"We've been complaining that we didn't hear before."
This is the first time a warning to a state in the United States.
The group showed the deaths of Toy Sanders, a black man from Missouri University and a black man in Tennessee.
At the beginning of this year, Sanders was arrested after the end of the fire by the Missouri police and died under suspicious conditions.
The report also highlights a new report, which shows the need to be stopped at 75% by the Ms.O.D. Department of Justice Department of Justice, the political drivers in the state.
"To warn people that people are awake, and their family, friends, and their work associates, they can be in Missouri."
"They must be ready to report their family to their relatives that they're going to pass through this state."
In Missouri, the latest numbers of F.B.I. have committed 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the report of the F.I.D., in 2015, this is the 16th chapter of the case.
The travel warning also applies to a new Missouri law that is forced to sue a employee, renting a house, or in business.
Previously, the American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) and Arizona suggested that the state's efforts to prevent the state from being arrested by the local government were issued a policy that would increase the lives of the state; ACLU, said that it would be more useful.
Travel warnings are usually broadcasting for other countries, but recently the aid groups have recently applied to a team of law and tradition in the United States.
Demba Ba in the fifth.
Two-years ago, the Chinese team was transferred to Shanhai Shenhua, and the circuit of the last season has returned to the Black-Beziktasha.
Black Eagle, who wanted a detailed medical report last week from the seigal player, went after the report from the star football player.
The Chinese representative who started working for the next season on a 32-year-old player who did not think of it on the next season paper, was playing the door of the Shanghai team.
Not written to list
Demba Ba, who wasn't on the list of foreign status in China, has sent him to return to the Black-rights.
The Chinese team agreed to leave the 32-year-old player.
The sengal football player is expected to sign up to Turkey in the past few days.
Castillo was surgery in Trabzonspor
"Proff. The operation of our operations performed by Dr. Urdo-mavili club in the Bordo-mavili club was established in 4 weeks by Castilo's left directory in Istanbul Liv Hospital" was suggested that "the operation of our operating operation was performed by Dr. Ugrker judges was established in four weeks.
Castillo was injured by his right-wheel team in the Slovekkaya camp with Herenveen.
Because of his treatment, the Colombian player, who was told to stay away from the field for three or four weeks, was also determined to act as an operational problem that he had lived earlier.
I'm out of Barzan!
Barzani was held in Duhook City for the third year's attack on the Ezards in Musul Province, Singapore.
In his speech, Barzani, who said he wanted to organize an independent conference on 25 September, said, "I have to say, I have no hope that Iraq will be a true and righteous country."
Iraq and I tried all the ways, but we were completely desperate and hopeless.
The past experiences we've lived with Iraq have brought us into this situation, and there's no guarantee that we can take our rights and protect them.
So in order to ensure life and security, we all need to show that we can measure our destiny to the whole world.
I need to draw the bottom of this, not for a purpose, but for us to reach a larger goal.
After the fall of Baas Rejimi in 2003, Barzani announced that the central government had made many promises to the Kingdom of Ukraine, soon after the disaster in Sanscar, the DEA's decision was issued.
"The barzani, who wants to establish peace and prosperity for the people of the country, came to know that he doesn't want to protect or protect us like a country in Iraq."
"He doesn't want us to make progress." He defends his view.
During the terrorist revolution with DEC, the Iraqi central government did not take their weapons, but in a short time, the Hazard Shabi, who was ordered by all of the weapons, wrote:
In Iraq's defense system, Pesmerge was not taken.
Central government didn't go to Pesmerge that you offered to Shabi.
Pesmerge is considered part of Iraq's defense system.
However, when Hazard Shabi had no presence in the mainland, the laws have been captured all possible.
We're not saying we're against Shabi.
Pemmerge and Hazard Shabi, who fought in the same cell, are often undermining the presence of Pesmergenine and terrorism.
These are the deep wounds we're with Baghdad.
The terrorist report was launched on August 3, 2014, and killed many of the people and women and children who were killed by Musul in Sincar in Singapore on August 3, 2014.
10 minutes and the facilitator's back.
According to a report on the BBC, Air France airlines were located on the west coast of Hokkaido, north of Japan when the coast of North Korea was on the north coast of South Korea.
The authorities of the fleet reported that the plane had been located 10 minutes ago, that the wind was about 100-50 miles (100 km) to the plane.
In the explanation of Air France, the fleet has been recorded that the wind didn't communicate with the route of the plane and that there was no problem in flight.
"In this case, the information we've got in this case shows that the fleet's flight route is over 100 miles [100 km] away."
Nothing is sacred, isn't it?
Trump's White House is now targeting Freedom.
The ultimate sign of the regime is starting to attack the gods.
The Americans know this as much as any of this; and, in fact, it's very quick at the Fardam Hussein in Baghdad in 2003...
Stephen Miller, one of the lockers of the Trump regime, knew what he was doing when he destroyed the legal contract with Jim Acosta in an attempt to eliminate the law in a powerful way.
To be fair, Miller didn't attack himself.
If he did that, he would have a boat tour and the free holder would have had him.
But he attacked his master, especially after 17 years of his appointment in 1903, Emma Lazarus was forced to join him in his famous poem.
Miller said, "I don't want to talk about history here, but freedom is a world of light for American freedom.
The poem that you're talking about was added later and not part of original freedom."
Miller's really right, but as he says, it's not really about history.
This seems to have been due to what Lazarus said, not only some older immigrants, but also the poor, "Yorgun, the poor, the poor, don't want freedom."
It never seemed so visible on our screens.
The Miller wasn't bringing a decent criticism; these people were told that Trump wasn't welcome at the United States.
The conflict between a court man's logic is a larger political and cultural war: it's actually a conflict about America's purpose.
Lazarus and his friends knew very well that after Lazarus and his death, their campaign to put his words into a very political movement.
The connection between the French and the American Republic was determined to celebrate the presence of freedom in a woman's body.
Lazarus changed this point: in the poem, there was no longer a woman's religion, and there was a voice.
And he has given himself a very different name: the mother of the people of various ages.
The marriage with poetry is a devastating blow against an American immigrant.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of his story, the doctors wanted to change him for a long time.
In 2010, the great president of the Battist John style declared that he was not invited to enter freedom in the world, but he argued that freedom was a major threat to the United States in the dark.
He's moving the United States to the rest of the world.
It's not to let the United States know the way to the United States."
In a very unusual way, Limbaugh actually discovered something.
It's all about the idea of being completely regulatory.
Lazarus' wonderful act of creation, which has been destroyed on the decks of ships, and has been seen as a long, long-term, long-term journey of hope.
It was really about seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and improve their lives.
He welcomed them with warm expressions of hope and confidence.
Of course, it's not a perspective that Miller and Trump will find any right.
It's not their way, but it's the only force that's their own power.
World Champion 2017: Neil Black commends the German Great Britain team
Eildh Doyle remembers when two Scotlands could only enter the Great Britain team.
Neil Black's 16-personal band in the World Champion's World Champion is going to be a "factive link to my bed."
The Scottish horse in the record was chosen for London 2017, which started on Friday.
Black believes that there is something going on in Scotland, and the United Kingdom's athletes need to learn from it.
"We're doing this and we're trying to understand it, and we're gonna work out until we get out of work."
"I'm talking to people in the Scotor Institute and they think it's about what they're doing.
Scotiles thinks it's about what they're doing.
Britain, it's what they're doing.
That's what the guy in the street is.
It's absolutely wonderful, no matter what the conditions are.
In Laura Muir and 5,000 m m. Andrew Butchatttt, who's going to fight Sir M. Butchatt, he's a captain, and Eildh Doyle was chosen as captain.
"Eilidh is a little low-handed.
The captain's speech is incredible." Black says.
"No matter where they live or where they live or practice, a few athletes are proud of that room and really motif.
Eilidh's passion and true feeling was wonderful."
He says he's got a gold horse from the United Nations in his fifth World Champion to win 400 m m.m., and says he's not in the British team.
In 1983, 1983 and 2015, the best team number in Scotland's previous world champions was won.
Last year, five British and two European bankers are Muir leader.
He'll join 1500 m and 5,000 m.
He's another Scottish who's been watching for the British Team and the annual anniversary season, including the victory of the Year's Games, and another one that runs in 1500 m.
Doyle remembers the first champion Lee McConll on the team.
He says that the team captain will not only go into my team, but in some cases he's going to race for medal and fight against the finals.
"The special part of being the captain was that the votes were given by other members of the team were already very large, so that your team was voted for you, and that it was special for me to know that your friends were voted for you and chosen you," he added.
"In case, I'm proud of all the Scots that came into my team.
This shows how much we've got.
And they're here as the horses who are trying to get out of my podium to prove themselves.
When it comes to the captain's speech?
Yeah, I think that's good.
I've benefited from the fact that we're very lucky in this situation, so there's a World Champion in our house.
I mean, it's just the effect that you can benefit from this internal field support and that we're going back to Olympic Stadium.
I'm burning a second chance to get there and fight, and there's a great atmosphere."
To prevent the attacks on Facebook: if you can't remove the voters' criticism, you're not allowed to be in charge of the state
Our country's father had a lot of knowledge about obtaining bad place under the pressure.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspaper didn't take too long to keep him in charge of everything until the political base.
Of course, the investigations have been bothering.
But his critics didn't silence him.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "The freedom of speech can be removed from the middle of the world and we can be thrown into the sea without a stupid and quiet way."
This brings me to the Maryland governor Larry Hogan who needs more work to be like Washington.
Hogan's personnel, his official Facebook page, prevented at least 450 people, and removed it.
The American Civil Guards filed him at the beginning of this week.
The governor didn't care about the case because it was serious, and the comment came up with the reaction, "Do you care?"
A lot of people said, "It's just Facebook."
But it's important.
It's especially important when you're like Hogan.
It's mostly a member of the Republic of the Republic that most often serves in a state of Democratic.
There's a second highest design rate between 50 citizens in the country.
Hogan's not a backfire.
He was well - known for his leadership and loyalty to the princes.
Although the Kemotherap later did not put his hairy head in a joke manner, he was very capable of using Facebook as the first tool to connect his selections.
I mean, it's not necessary and dangerous to prevent people from coming to the page of the government's government by official, and by the people's taxpayers.
In a interview with the Washington Post, Hogan's wife, Amela Chasse, argued that there is no longer much to prevent the comment.
But it's easy to use images of trolls or spams or those who hate hate people to attack.
The Post spoke to some of the real ones that were prevented by Hogan.
And these are only true people who speak to their chosen leader: a teacher, a minister, a priest, and a role.
He said all of them are respectful, reasonable, and unbridled.
Papaz has received an account from Hogan's Catholic faith in his share.
Maryland Bowie was a lawyer Lacshmi Samma Ramani, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I've made a comment that I've been disappointed that she'd been disappointed with her hate crimes and other news about the next time."
"I also don't like the idea of having a large group of overly worried citizens, when I comment on the same subject, when some people comment on the same subject, I don't like to see a lot of anxiety over words.
Others call the Governor's staff a "supervised spin attack" and are probably called "five defence".
Facebook's time makes it easier to make a message easier to get a message through a simple way of stopping an event or removing a bad message from a bad message.
Personelin's outside, collecting papers that have been printed, or were sent to fire, or were being arrested and arrested by the Protestants, and is much more clean than the old days required to shut up.
But, as in digital, that's exactly what happens.
Hogan, Facebook, and the other social media are not the first public mission to be criticized.
President Trump is sentenced to the trial by Twitter users who were banned in Twitter.
One of the decisions that could be delivered in the future was from Virginia last week.
President of the Governing Body of London, Alexander's U.S. President James C. Cacherris, who refused to take a choice on Facebook.
In Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (C Republican) was visited by ACLU for the use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington's time, there was a very similar influence on the internet.
Between 1775 and 1800, newspaper numbers were held four, and unknown letters were discovered.
Even then Washington had unknown trolls.
"Juricola", "Varius", "Belisarius" and "Portius," all the people who used to write letters to the newspaper on Washington's decisions.
According to George Washington Markets Project of History, the Department of Justice, the Department of Justice, the Department of Justice, Ticart, and the Seursphere, has removed the office of request from the Department of Justice.
But he didn't silence them.
The claim is that the freedom of the nation is the foundation of our nation.
True leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes that your home will be at the Renaissance Club.
In the next three days, Ron Rafferty, Ron Rafferty, next three days, the Renaissance Club in South London, Scott wants you to be at home when you're home by the Cor Open.
Archerfield describes the leader of the next door before he lost Paul Eales in the final door, and he is acting as the messenger of the new school and the commander of the club and the CEO of Jerry Sarvadii.
"I watched the Renaissance Club build, and we see it together with this organization," Rafferty said.

It was very special for me and my wife Sharon last year.
It's a time to remember with special and loyal love."
Gary Orr, who joined European Senor Tour at the beginning of this year, makes the game back in his own field.
This organization is going to be the first cause of Scotland since the Amberdeen Management of Scottish Open in 2013.
Helensburg Man Orr said, "When you struggle in the government, it always means more understanding."
"You want to do good, but you feel too much pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played moral golf.
I'm happy to go so far."
Those who participate in these three groups in the field; former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and you are the King's champions Paul Brodhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
The Orr and the Old Ryder Cup is located in the area of Sam Torrance, while others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir, and Ross.

In 2015, the Freeport dropped $3.1 billion worth of gold and treasure.
As a result, Papua has $78 billion receptors.
What's wrong with this wealth for the Popes is that Endonezia's powerful army continues to live.
The New York Times reported that Freeport paid the local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004, and the total $10,000, including the totals.
The Popes' more autonomous call threatens this gold-billion rabbit, and without mercy.
According to the Right Guards, over 500,000 people have been killed by the Indonesian army since 1969 and thousands of others have been raped, tortured, and imprisoned.
In Papua's mountainous zones in the 1970s, public killers reached the Asian Human Rights Commission.
Indonesia's police only arrested more than 3300 at the last year in the country.
In 2016, Brisbane's report "We're going to Kaybee", former law enforcements, law enforcements (such as rape and electrical executions), and peacemaking.
"It's hard to count the number of victims for every week," says Andrew Harrisono, a researcher at the Endono of Human Rights.
Papua's sources have increased pressure because of Indonesia's moving from other places.
The population of the region is 3.5 million Christians, but the public islands of Indonesia have changed from Java, Borneo, Sumatra, and Sulawi to an economic plan.
The Javawarg buffets are sold to the gado-gado, which is served with a sedimented chicken and vegetable sauce.
The local people are forced to react.
"The audience sells chicken and seasons more cheaper than local Papuans," says Paniai, 24-year-old, who moved to Japan for work.
"This caused the local Popes to lose the papua-ma-ma's market."
In 2014, the President of Indonesia, known as Jocowi, promised to solve the differences and differences in Papua in the election campaign.
The former Maganaz took part in 27 from the 21st regions of Papua, including the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But there's little change in Papua and the local people feel deceived today.
"Our hearts are broken, 'cause in 2014 we voted for Jokowi, the hope that justice will be restored."
Actually, Paniai lived only two months after Jokowi started his worst situation in the month.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children out of town sang Christmas in Enarithal, and two Indonesian soldiers were covered by the motorcycle.
Fearful kids told them to have their priorities.
One of the soldiers was drinking to their bases, and the local priest came back with four soldiers, according to Yavedt Tebai.
The victims and the witnesses said the soldiers who had been taken under alcohol and beat their rifles.
Then one of the soldiers fired a kid's band.
The 16-year-old Yuian Yemo, who was one of the children, was so bad that he went into the coma.
A few hours later, the government's election council was set up at the fire, and the next day, things went on.
Over 1,000 Papuan men, women and children were gathered to demand justice in a football field in front of the local police station in front of the military.
They were carrying traditional hunting oils, and they danced thewaite of the Pope's Mee Pago tribe (at the same time running and with the bird kiss).
Some protesters started throwing stones to the police and the military chain.
"If there were more than three times more strokes, they said to the soldiers, "If the crowd showed them more than three times, kill them."
Jeremiahias Kayame (56), the head of the Kego Koto neighborhood in Enato, saw the danger, and ordered them to return home.
No one had any intention of listening.
"When I returned to my left ticket when I was back in the park with bright colors," he told TIME.
Kayme still doesn't know who's still shooting, but the bullet says it came from the soldier who was found.
"He's been rude, he's been fired many times."
According to the cousin of the attack, the local Alfius Yaww was shot three times.
"I ran to him and checked his body to make sure that he was the only one in Indonesia."
"I saw he died... kiss him."
Papua Police President General Yotje Mende told the reporters that the police were only "inflammatory," because the police were under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten us by killing us."
"It's the matter of death."
According to the Human Rights Review, five young Protestants were killed and many were injured.
The news of death reached Jakarta the next day.
Jokowi, three weeks later in Japan, said that the victim had shared the pain of their families, and he promised to solve the history questions in Papua.
He said, "I want this case to be resolved immediately, and it's never again."
In June 2016, the Security Minister Wiranto October said that there was an unsatisfactory mechanism that was not fair for historical human rights.
But the excuse was almost immediately started.
"There's been a long time ago.
Some are in the 90s and some are early in the 2000s.
The point is, we're determined to solve these conflicts, but there's a process we need to pass."
Wranto, who spoke to TIME in June 5, left his step back in saying there was no plan to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "All will be solved by law."
B.M. said that more than 1,000 people who had been accused of murder involving the bloodless act of the East Timor in 1999 had already decided on the case of Wranto, including Paniai.
The families of Paniai's victims have met such claims with a painful doubts.
"I've been meeting four times in three years, but there's no progress." Yohanes.
>>uzb_Latn<< "I'm tired."
He says he's still alive in fear years.
He says, "I'm worried."
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the soldier, I'm afraid to be shot."
His brother Yacobus is re-enacting his opinion that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss it.
He says he was beaten by the soldier after helping the victims bury four.
He says, "After he buried his wounds, the soldier came to call me."
The attack hasn't stopped yet.
On Tuesday, Paniai's neighbor set fire to Indonesia's police officers.
A man who refused to help a non-neutral man who did not have him to get to the hospital was killed, and 17 men were wounded.
When he was about 24-year-old, Ravianus Douw died while he was drowning in a nearby lake.
The angry villages have organized protests in front of the company's business office.
The police said the peasants hit the officers, and they react to the warning.
But the local people say they're shooting into the crowd and killing someone.
"We're afraid we're going to get a lot of panic, and we're gonna get revenge."
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
Deiai parliamentary officers were held responsible for this work, and the move police took away from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem area for the Indonesian government.
The extent of my understanding is the joy of the people of Me, Moni, Dani, and Damal tribes, who live in the green mountainous region of Papua.
A majority of Papuans have joined the military army, which claimed that they were protecting the army of the Endonese military soldiers by placing their rights under attack.
Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoa, some higher OPM leaders come from Paniai.
In response, thousands of people were arrested in Paniai and had been favored by the military for the last few years.
Some people can never see it again.
Paniai is known as "trajected and forgotten" among the people of Papua.
Fascinating poverty increases.
It's very expensive to buy little rice in Enorotali.
It's not possible to get the bread.
The people here grow up everything they eat, the fruit of the note, and some vegetables.
It's the work of women who can be executed with four or five fields or five fields.
They usually save most of the damage for the family, sell the rest of them in the local market.
The 10th note only takes 10,000 Indonesian rupiah (75 cents).
Over time, the economic differences between the local Papuans and the Nargie Airlines have increased since new airlines opened their new airline.
Things that are less likely to be better trained and more rich are going to immigrants.
The Popes are very rare for their capitas or the needs of the papuaries to act their own business as a competition.
John Gobai, president of Panai's tribe, says, "People are not interested in staying in the village because there's no work or money."
The terc keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, international media has often been able to limit the restrictions of international media.
At the beginning of this year, French journalist Frank Escudie and Basille Longchamp were restricted to their video recording, although they were not limited to "coordinating with British institutions" from Papua.
Human Rights Director Phonim Kine stated that Jokowi's election campaign was not performed and was not completed.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to hear the non-consumptional vulnerabilities from Papua and West Papua," he said.
Without the lack of pressure, the government of Indonesia means that the international pressure of the government is limited to the neighbors near Papua.
In March six Pacific nations (Tonga, Nau, Palau, Tlaau, Marshall Islands, and Solomon Islands) urged the UN to investigate the Council of Human Rights, including the Panaia attacks.
The same countries support OPMs.
"There is still a democratic system in Indonesia, and therefore the freedom of human rights is hard to maintain."
The local people want more foreign government to take care of.
A official declension from Holland, the country's government's Government, visited the House of Human Rights, on May 4th, a source of local people who wanted to attend Japan on May 4th, and who didn't want to say "We want to be silent."
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Popes say that there's no reason to vote again to Jokowi.
"A man who has good intentions for Babylon" says Gobai, president of the Council, "but he is caught by people who have been attacked by Paniai."
Jokowi wants his people to know that he has been beaten in poor training and health services, not just under the threat of a violent army.
Gobai says the people of Paniai, like the other Popes, will see it as a "borg" that they give up their votes to Jokowi.
They don't need money, they just want justice."
Despite threats and threats, Paniai's victims have acted as a final symbol of their victims: not burying a victim's nausea in front of the police and the police station.
Knowing that justice can never be accomplished, they will at least make them forget those responsible for their sins.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus says, "and he's in a hurry.
"What can we do?"
The fire struck Dubai's 'Mulayle' for the second time.
On Friday, on Friday, one of the world's highest schools of fire broke down, and hundreds of miles of water forced them to flee the design of 77 feet [37 m].
This is the second major fire ever spread in two years known as the tower.
The building was released, no injury, and no explanation about the cause of the great fire.
"We were sleeping and awake to the fire's warning, people shouted.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to reach the 15th floor."
Dubai's civilian defense engines said the fireman fires were on the side of the fire by 4 (00 GMT) in the morning, and they're going to cool the building.
The government explained that they were trying to make peace for those affected.
This could lead to questions about the safety of materials used in the outer parts of high buildings around the world.
The investigation that the fire management was after the fire in 2015 found that most of the damage were in the outer panels for deportation and monitoring.
In the United Kingdom, police said that 80 people believe that the signaling and closing panel on the Longreach Tower of London, which died on the Greenfeld tower, could be found there.
A 'sossocial Help' of more than 4 thousand chronic patients
The family and Social Politics will benefit from the social aid program that will start with chronic diseases and family members, at first, 400,000 nuclear and SPE patients.
The Department of Agriculture planned to give the patient a monthly support on three of the fees, with regular psychosocial support.
According to Edin's report, family and Social Politics, a long time ago working with Minister Fate Betel Sayan Kaya, "Cronic Diseases and the New Social Assistance Programs for the Family."
The social aid program, which has started in the world by the Department of Health and Health, has been a major factor in the development of citizens who are struggling with chronic diseases, economic and psychological problems.
The Department of Agriculture, who has completed all the preparations for the development of the program, will also provide the family with not only a social help program but also a regular psychosocial support.
Thus, it is intended to be left alone with poor citizens and family members who continue their treatment at home.
In the first study, Subuku Skerzoan Pansephaliti (SSPE) who is struggling with a brain disease, and a brain tumor, will be able to support former citizens with a new social help program.
In the progress of the program, poor citizens who fight other risk factors will be taken to the relief program.
It can also be added to the health care prescribed by the U.S. Department of Agricultures who are planning to take care of their own medical care, whether they are able to take care of their own health care or the need to improve home care.
In order to benefit from the dysfunction, a person must pay less than two to three percent of the month's pay prices.
In addition, citizens with SPE are required to have a health report defined by the Department of Health and Health Report, which is defined by the Department of Health and Justice in the Right of Health Reports.
More than 1 of 5 U.S. passengers bring to flight
According to the airport passengers, more than 20 percent of the U.S. Department of Agriculture has been kidnapped by the U.S. Security Department of Controls, at least 6 percent of which the U.S.A.A.A.A.A.D.A.A.A.D.A.A.A.A.D.A.A.D.A.A.D.A.A.D.A.D.A.A.D.A.A.D.A.A.D.A.D.A.A.D.A.A.D.A.D.A.D.A.A.D.A.A.D.D.A.A.A.A.D.A.A.D.D.D.A.D.D.A.A.A.D.D.D.A.D.D.D.S.S.S.S.S.'S.S.S.S.A.S.S.S.A.A.A.S.A.D.D.S.S.S.S.A.A.D.D.A.A.A.S.S.
He argued that at least one hundred percent of the time, he realized that he was traveling with violent weapons, environmentally or explosives.
The study by Stratos Jet Charters, called a jet rent service, found that over 1,000 young passengers were more likely to break the rules.
Among the participants who admit that they're trying to fly something prohibited by TSA are 197 per cent of the Y bird, so that less than 15.
The most common substances missing from the TSA agents are food and fluids.
When more than 3 percent admit that women have limited security devices, two percent of women, and 3.7 percent of male participants, who have been carrying illegal drugs to fly.
The firm said how many people had brought escapes to the country to find out how many people were in the security of the airport, and how many of the passengers had been able to find out what he was doing.
It's not a surprise that it's the biggest time to get away from security without knowing or knowing.
Still, as the firm says, the TSA rules are a little gangrelli and head-driven.
People often don't know what kind of fluid they can carry or how much they can carry.
So it's not a surprise that the greatest amount of substance in the TSA is to appear as illegal liquids.
For a while, people thought that TSA could be dealing with as much property as possible to the books.
They're allowed in warm flights, but they're not allowed in international situations.
China won the United States's explanations
The Chinese Foreign Minister Vang Yi said at the press meeting of the capital Barn, "We are not interested in regulatory change, the regulatory regulatory, and we are not looking for a price to send our soldiers to the north of the country."
The Chinese Foreign Minister Vang said the basics of the Washington administration of Washington, the United States, in the way that the U.S. has been affected by these principles, and the resulting results have been expressed in a specific policy.
Vang, who has noticed the security of the Korean division, has noted that the sides are expected to solve their concerns by equal degrees of dialogue, while the management has been determined to solve nuclear damage, peace, and stability, since the problem is solved with dialogue and discussion.
The EPA President Pruitt, Obama's return, has continued to hinder the Emission Rights
One day after the execution of 15 states, President Scott Pruitt, former president of the Obama government, decided to violate the laws of Obama's law, which had previously led to the destruction of bad smoke.
Pruitt described his organization as more sensitive to the needs of the state environments than those of the past.
A federal court has never mentioned a case against his former position.
The point is that the state's level of gravity is starting to meet 1 October for the end of 2015 standards.
Pruitt said that he would be forced to spend more time on his own organization and to avoid "restricting the decision" or "to prevent the economic growth" from taking action.
Pruitt, President Donald Trump, who served as a reliable representative of Oklahoma's state president for a long-term environment before he was elected by President Donald Trump.
Pruitt has been moved repeatedly to prevent chemical and phosphoryl fuel industry from coming to Washington.
It's the last time that I've ever heard of Pruitt's change on Wednesday.
Last month, a federal court in Washington ruled that the EPA manager of the EPA was trying to limit the restrictions of oil and gas firms that were required to reduce the amount of oil and gas.
On Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that you return back on the post standards, while the EPA was only able to meet the new standards of new standards and to work on complex processes.
"The EPA will often fail to meet the end of the recent decisions, while the active group and others will wait to resolve the timing of their decision," said Pritt, a former EPA.
"We don't believe it's a crime, and we take the history of terminism.
We will take care of him."
However, the EPA said that Pritt could be used at one point once to ensure that the organizations are "recommenable with the policy and the existing knowledge" of the organization.
The Republicans in Congress are pressureing me to write up a bigger record of the zoon laws.
An Last month, the Council of Parliament, published last month, attempts to get up to at least eight years of compromise to follow the laws of 2015.
The advance was not brought to the Senate yet.
New York leader Eric Schneiderman, who was leading the EPA this week, said he wanted to keep the group legal pressure.
"After our citizens' decision, EPA's decision is an important factor in the health and safety of more than 115 million Americans who have been affected by a bad smoke that affects more than 115 million Americans.
>>uzb_Latn<< During the case, I joined New York in California, Connecticut, Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, New Mexico, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Digest.
The automotives, electric sensors, oil traffic, chemical reactions, and other sources that react to the sun's light are caused by the gas level.
A group of pesticides that appear around the world can lead to serious breathing problems, and thousands of deaths each year.
People health advocates and environmentalists used the surprise change of Pruitt.
"It's a lot of pressure to get this right name from someone we're trying to protect the weather," said Lori Anne Burd, from the biodiversity Center of Biodiversity.
"We must continue to fight the ideological fight against the influence of the Trump administration, the environment, the environment, and the external groups."
Effection is the only house.
In July, six years of ecclesiastic unemployment took about 10.5 per cent of the ocean and raised the economic security chain to the ground of 3.5 years.

According to the richest phone calls, Trump was forced to pay the border wall to Mexico.
The United States President Donald Trump and the telephone records of Mexican and Australian leaders were leaked by Washington Post.
During a telephone call with the Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto in January 27, Trump stressed that he would not pay for a public border wall he was offered.
The U.S. President called the Mexican president on the wall, and said, "You can't tell this to the press."
Trump's presidential campaign started building a wall over the south border of the United States and promised to pay the project to Mexico.
It was also published by Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbul, who turned out to be an Australian diplomat.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbul that the agreement to take over the U.S. to Australia was "scrupulous" and "aplica" and that the agreement was established in Obama's administration after he proposed to take the U.S. government to the United States.

The patients broke the nose of the doctor
Turkey's Higher Education and Research Hospital and staff have suggested that a doctor's friends have been forced by a patient's side tomorrow morning.
"No good" in their hands, the crowd gathered in front of the hospital in front of the hospital.
The hospital's child Cardiology Chief, Dr. Feyza Azarennour Pic, "No violence in the sky" appears to me in a bad place.
There's no place in health, violence.
He said: "This land will certainly be well-pleased with its people if they will be well-pleased with him."
The work of health workers Dr. Kamil Türkman, Ankara First-Section Hospital General Prof. Dr. President of the Republic of Ankara, Dr. President of Turkey High School of Education and Research and Research Hospital, also supported the patient's patients with Dr. Mustafa Pactic.
That's sad, Pac, he said:
Unfortunately, health workers are more violent.
We are re-encompassing this event by the time of the day, which is the last night of our heart disease.
We demand that our government take measures for the end of such events, our ministry, and our country, to increase our sense of urgency in this matter.
I'm breaking up with my hospital and health employees last night.
"I'm sorry, we're living at this time, a career association."
"We're going to take our own measures, but most importantly, our people don't have their own health employee."
"Our laws of violence in the sky have been more impressive."
The government's papers are keeping up with this.
He's taking care of security right now.
These things were always empty in the past, but now it's a real public case, and the government's being charged with the case, following the case.
He also used the words, "There are heavy punishment examples of this."
After the explanations, the workers continued their work.
According to the claim, the incident occurred at 1745 hours ago.
Dr. Hamdimet Mebbek, who had lost his life in the dark condition, has been attacked by the patient, who has reported death.
He was taken away from the scene by doctors and assistants; the hospital was called to the hospital.
When he broke the nose in the scene, the attackers were taken.
A doctor from the witnesses said:
When our friend went to visit a patient who had lost his life, he was arrested and attacked by the patient and the two of us.
Our friend broke the nose, left in blood.
Then we took our friend into the surgery office and hid him.
For 15-20 minutes, the security set set is between us.
If the patient were to get over that security wall, there would be a lot worse.

The U.S. protested
According to a report by AA's local sources, the U.S. terrorists, under the military support of the United States, spread their homes in the north of Raka's north corner of the area where the terrorist attack took place.
The reaction of the civilians who were burned and put in the hands of the silicons turned against the terrorist organization.

I don't want to move the ancient world's fights tomorrow.
The delay of the Yurt and the world's reality can have an impact on the extent to which the countries are forced, not even those of the nations.
One of the reasons that we've determined in the form of "nationality" is that the natural world of the world may be forced by certain conditions of the East, or that these facts may not be able to prevent it from being exposed to the eastern regions of the East.
Don Ashtt and Oblomoov are also involved in the social world of which they are forced to recognize and change.
When Cervantes began to "Don Kashot" and he was still a knight.
Or Gigev's "Obloomov" when he comes to see the facts, it's an example of how everything can move like the old one.
China's examples, for example, were open to the world until the end of the 15th century, and in a country ruled over the seas, the throne of an horrendous prison.
This is the case until the captains get out of the Chinese black waters.
We've always lived with the truth and transformation of the truth and change of one foot, the eye, the ear, the ear, the ear, the ear, and the ear, and the ear.
We tried our old and new part to move to today's day, bringing up to the old circumstances and thinking about today, tomorrow.
And one of us, we could act as fast as the thoughts of the world, about its reality and the reality of the world, as well as the thought of change in the developing countries.
This has always been a source of conflict, and suffering.
In college with Medrese, the modern army, the modern army, the faith, led to a dramatic revolution.
As far as prosperity is worse, new and future events in the time of a certain era were not accepted by the former and will remain behind.
yesterday's priority began to declare a statement, "Exercise" and a new and forward future, and a person who tried to explain the conditions of the world in harmony with the new reality.
The most important lesson in Ottomanic was that the empire was finally destroyed by the thought and state life of those who have taken the most important lesson in the Ottomanic.
The most important lesson our Ottoman history was that the world's concentration and the speed of change was that it was inevitable to survive.
Because this lesson was very good, we could become an example of this geography that could preserve its unity from World War 1 to the time of World War I, to protect its stability in peace.
We have to leave the global change process behind and go back to the truth.
In other words, there's no good for anyone to carry out our democracy in the past, and to carry out the laws of blood today.
Moreover, the smallest mistakes in today’s world lead to great and dramatic crisis.
The most challenging geography of this is the Middle East we have.

Turkey wind
The global seas that trust in Turkey's future fought against the storm that occurred yesterday.
>>uzb_Latn<< Energy and the Department of Health have been banned by the World record in order to reduce the deployment of the National Energy Department.
Turkey's energy resources are brought down by 1 billion investment and 4% of fuels.
From 2019 to 2019, local production will be involved in the system.
In the United States, China, Germany, and Denmark, the United States have been divided into 8 concerts by the Energy and the Department of Sources.
At first, the five proposals were opened to determine the owner of the five most vulnerable bids.
After the first offer, the worst offer was $4.19/killovats.
The range of my openness has been defined as 0.001 cents.
Soon after the war, Enercon decided to join the public teams that were located in Gold Wind, GE, Senvion, and Vestas.
In my open format, Siemens, Nordex, and Mingyang were the bands.
After the release of Nordex, MingYang-Ilk-Ilkh and Siemens-Turkers-Talion last second.
MingYang-Ilk construction 11 times.
Siemens-Turkers-Kalion Energy Council has never been used.
Energy and Of course, Minister Bert Colonelrak: a record day for Turkey.
30 different types of my openness.
The strength of the concentration between two concertsiums has been the Siemens-Turers-Turkers-Turryon team that offered the lowest offer with St/ lockat.
While concertsium was offered a $449 cent/killowatization offer, the assistant assistant assistant Alparslan announced the proposal for the presidential committee of Commission 3.48.
As a result of the report of YEKA for two hours, Turkey has received a world record.

I'm proud of it for my people, my country.
Minister Colonelk said that the sun's energy aims to take the first local production panels to reach the area before 2018, "We're going to include our local production products into the system until 2019."
The turbines will be set up in five areas.
The firm who win the race will receive at least 50 megawastal wind forces in each of these five regions.
Siemens-Turkers-Kalion group will be on 1 billion dollars.
With the use of local wind platforms, the average 3 billion kilovolatt energy will be produced each year and about 1.1 million homes will receive electricity.
Using the wind-sized winds to save, the average is 1.5 million tons of CO2/year emissions will be saved.
The firm who win the race will make a factory with a million dollars.
In the factory at least 2.3 megawat force, the average average 300 to 450 local wind species will be produced.
For at least five years of meeting the Ar-Ge work in the five fields of the concerts, wings, generator design, and production technology, software and innovation.
While Ar-Ge is leaving $5 million budgets each year, 80% of local engineers will work 50 technical staff.
The factory will be established in 21 months since the contract was signed.
The license period of the project is 30 years.
"We're planning to build the banks of the Republic of Turkey, the president of the State, the President of the United States, to take over 64 percent of the local production in the project, 35 percent of the teams are going to be out of poverty, and some of the local banks," he said.
Turker said that the economy has fueled the Turkish economy.

He said, "We're glad to talk."
The SIemens Game of Turkey has also stated that we will do everything we can to reduce the activity in Turkey for 160 years, saying, "We'll do our best to reduce the energy units."
There will be 65 percent of the landlands of the wind species that will be produced in the factory.
Of the 80,000 industrial particles in the wind species, 65 per cent of the population (E.200 particles).
At least 50 MW in each of the five regions will be built at the total 10000 MW.
It's $5 million each year for 3.750 people to break up to the Ar-Ge-Ge activities.
1.000MW Rygrör Tessii for 6% of Locality Orana at least 300 to 450 local windtypes in the power of 2.3 MWe.
On 1 billion dollars, I'm investing 400 MW/year-old wind species in the year is a factory for 100 million dollars.

Moore's Ford Catalytic: Activeists Represented the Irkç of Justice
A model Ford Mercury was held between a group of viewers in the Monroe Georgia and moved to the small Ford Bridge in Moore.
The four black passengers and a white driver, the car, before they reached the bridge, went ahead to cover a white man's path.
He took a long breath from a gang leader in the middle-year-old dress and looked carefully out of the window.
In there, the prisoners were trapped with fear.
"We want this, Roger!"
"Get her out of the car!"
As a young black man pulled out of his front seat, screams were dark.
Luckily, this terrible scene, played on June 22th, is not just a rehearsal.
But when a science shooting around the neck of the "Roger" neck, everyone suddenly gave a pretty real cold.
Since 2005, Human Rights have returned to the Ford bridge in Moore, two black couples (Roger and George and Mae Murray Dorsey) and Mae Murray Dorcey in 1946, to re-engine the Klux Klan.
No one has ever been accused of murders until now.
"If we know who we are in our laptops, we don't think one person has been arrested for all these years."
"It's a curse in this history, but we have a load in our spirits."
Brooks was a former Georgia State member and a man-of-law for life.
For himself, this re-enginement is a annual reminder that injustice has never been corrected by the Monroe community.
He said, “We want to get rid of this; we want to get rid of it; we want to do it first.”
"We can't have until we have the law of the land and of justice."
On July 27, 1946, one of the victims of the Ford Line at Moore's death.
According to the NBC News, more than 50 men were suspects from Monroe and the environment area.
But one of them has never been investigated.
The suspects have been escaped for ten years, but the authorities of human rights say that the double motivators of the town are always well aware of: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court made it possible for the politicians in Georgia to vote in front of that summer.
According to the FBI, political associate Roger Malcom, who had a white land owner, Barnett Hester, who had a white land.
Brooks said that the story in town was in fact that Hester's wife, Dorothy, was sleeping with his wife, and that she was not her husband.
According to the FBI, Loy Harrison, a white landman who came in July 25, 1946, paid 600 bucks to get Malcom out of jail.
Dorothy and his cousin Mae Murray went to jail in George Dorsey's office.
But when they came to the Ford Bridge at Moore's, when they got away from prison, a lynxed the car.
A FBI report says, "It seems that he was Harrison, who set the murders and ordered orders."
"In fact, there was a secret agreement between the state and the local state powers that did not only take the place but did it, and did not hide the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks told me more and more.
He said: "This is a vote for a vote.
He said, ‘It is a sign for the people of the world.’
He's been working for Cassandra Greene in Moore's Ford Bridges, who's been in the past decade.
She looks at all the details, she's focused, and many of them believe that she doesn't exist in America anymore.
It's hard to look at, and it's even harder to look at, but Grene says it's your goal.
He said, "We don't want to talk about Linç because it's all that's ugly in our hearts."
"If you don't listen to me or if you don't listen to what's happening to me, I can't develop a relationship with you."
The projects of this year began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 black and the rest of the year, they were filled with a room of white and the rest of the play, and they listened to the good stories of the Greene play.
Wade Marabugh serves as Greeen's assistant manager.
Over the years, President Klansman played the role, but he says that his role was never easy.
Marbaugh said, "I feel abandoned because it's not me."
"I think it's important to keep this past alive because we don't want to go back to then."
The actors who played Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, made Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona sell themselves.
Malcom's been so angry with Dorothy that he's so angry with her wife, Hester, and starts playing with her.
"Z, get out of my property," I said!
Rascona reacts.
He's got a shot.
And then everyone (and at least black actors) drown in the heroic.
It's the best Greene laughs.
Rascona said, "What?"
He was up, he was surprised.
Was it too hard?
Greene said, "No."
"I don't think it was white people then."
One of the black players was mixed up with a joke.
"You have to press 'R'."
So the energy in the room changes and some kind of peacelessness.
Everyone's forced to do it right, not just for the sake of the game, but for the memory of four who were murdered at the same time.
The stage is starting again.
This time, Rascona says the word that starts with N, is sharp and sharp.
There's absolutely no one's laughing.
Reshaping is rapidly over and over again.
The screams, the gun shooting, and then the silence.
A woman with a monastery on the funeral list is standing on the feet of actors and is reading the "Garie Halley" of Billie Holiday.
In one of these words, they break the voice.
Over a hundred-year-old averages of four-dimensional bands wiped out their eyes and eyes.
The monitor's about to be black and white.
A couple, Ithca, came from New York to see the performance.
While Brooks led them to the Holy Land of Malcoms and Dorsey, they all held a violent German of Georgia for almost eight hours.
As far as this point, the murders were left as an aekdot, but now it's supposed to be the curse of the air.
While the last notes of the song are weak, Greene is invited to examine his relationship and body.
The kids are on their hands, the fake blood and the invisible bodies, and they're flung together.
Like a little boy who remembers, "They didn't die in a boat."
In a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd and suddenly ends.
The actors throw the lens rope and wipe your eyes off.
Bradshaw is holding on to Marbaugh, who plays President Klansman.
Nick Rascona falls into two of his players, and they're losing old age in their hands, the emotional cost of performance comes to him.
One of the women says, "It's okay."
"We know that's not what's in your heart.
You did this for a reason."
Later, the audience sits in dinner with actors.
A white couple from Atlanta on a table are talking about reticulateing a political couple.
Denise Duplinsky's performance is hard to find words about how he feels about him.
He said, "These terrible, terrible words and those of those who are like you, and they come out of people like you, and they do so because they look like you."
He added, "What he did to me was still thinking that the lenses are still going on," he said, "and now he's calling the police weapons.
At the end of the room, Tyrone Brooks has an interesting room when he eats dinner at the room and tells people his rights.
He said the next year's performance has already been planned.
He said, "It's an inspiration to me to describe what we're doing, but also a teacher."
"You know, if you don't teach it, it might happen again.
Those who have gone before them, and they are not aware of it.

According to the first findings of the Hakan's autopsy report, the first findings in the autopsy report are suicide.
In the detailed study, the child was not touched by any scars and threats in his body.
The cause of suicide is that the elastic release of an elastic release that binds his neck to his neck.
It was also determined that his family was an elastic budget used in wounds.
According to the newspaper Newsörkar, a report on the death of the child was found that after the report was made about the child's death, the report was to be sent to the Higher Court of Justice.
When the police analyzed the child's suicide, they're on the computer with all the details.
The police's friends were to submit to the statement of the Hakan.
It is said that he can reach the third person or a gang with the information he's being given to his neighbor's "cleaned" computer.
The police considers that the Hakan might be a suicide gang.
Hakan's defeat of suicide has turned his eyes into text2, which is violent.
In 2009, the "minic hacker" 13-year-old "minic hacker" again was killed by the "minic hacker" of the "minic hacker" 13-year-old.

"We don't think it's about being a ghost, because of the game, we don't think it could harm himself or anyone else," he said.
That's how it was found, son.

Primary KARE: It may have been mixed with the gang
Familys don't usually pay attention to this.
They look at what's going on in my kid's house.
The kid is communicating with a lot of people through the games.
It may be a case of giving up a loan, or a denial of it.
Or someone in the game invited him home, maybe there was a problem with them.
He may have been affected by the problems that he has experienced with other people who have engaged in the game.
The image of the game could be the child's real idea.
It could be about the trauma of suicide.
If the child is still in charge of complaint against the family, there's also a reason why he can't solve this problem.
It can't have committed suicide for himself.
It's probably about the kid's ability to get into the gang.
He might have got into the bag.
It can't be anything that the child could do alone.

The parents need to take measures to ensure that their children are affected by what kind of drink they are affected by.
There's only two children in Turkey who said he died of the game.
This shows that the end of a child's life is not just the effect of games.

We need to look around the kid's sociological and psychological.
The 8-month delivery in Borsa Istanbul was up to 50 percent.
By December 2016, BIST continued its high-end train on December 8, 2016 and moved its rise to the top 8th month.
Thus, the index was the first 8 months since July 2007 when it was up to 45% in this period.
In some summers, the U.S., the U.A., the U.S., the U.S., the U.A., returned the world's capital debt in Japan, and in some summer, he did not leave his leadership.
On July 7,06, a total of 7.54% of the BIST's 100 percent increase in the United States, followed by the Down Jones equation at 0.081 and FTSE 100 in England.
With the DAX index in Alabama, Nikkei's index was completed with the cost of the summer.
As the January-teleuous period grew, the UNIST 100 were seen as a higher performance rate than the major world debt and growth rates.
According to the 2016 closing of 2016, the UNT 100 unit of 100 units, 10,76 increase, the Dow Jones rate, the DATX rate with 5.5%, and the Nikkekeke's rate, with 3.21 degrees per cent.
The MSCI EM index on the reach of the country's capital has brought about 23 percent.
It's seen that even in the past, when the history of the BIST 100 genes showed similar performances.
The last 8 months between December 2006 and July 2007, the UNIST 100 percent of the population was saved from 383 percent in this period.
He also won a high value on 9 June 1997 between August 1996 and March 1997.
The Meksa Yatrim Research director Eren Can Can announced that the EU 100 percent increased the rate of BIST 100 months from the beginning to 37 degrees this year.
The company said that 23 percent of the marketing markets (EM) made up of MSCI, while looking at these centers, it was a positive separation:
The funding of countries in progress continues from the beginning of the year.
In particular, the fundings in the search of high-quality are preferable countries that are higher.
In the case of this situation, yurts are affected in positive direction.
Of course, taking risks on a global scale is a great deal.
That's why he's looking for the same kind of document that's in the risk-structured presence stadium.
In the United States, we see that S&P 500 percent of the year has been tested every week by 11 percent.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (Fed) announced that 3 percent percent of the U.S. Department of Agricultures had dropped stress, but the U.S. Department of Justice pointed out that Fed had a significant increase in the economy.
The U.S. states that the inflation is not yet in the United States, that Fed's efforts to increase percentage rates are very effective in the current industry.
The U.S. President Donald Trump said that he can't cancel a health reform known as "Obamakare," the U.S. Department said, "and how fast the U.S. economies of the U.S. Department of Economics have increased rapidly and increased the development of the world's population, and it has been said, "and it's faster and faster that the development of the Ff-plicability of the Ff has been increased."
He said that the difference between the difference between the BIST 100 and the BIST 100 despite the fact that there is a year since Turkey's market marketing campaigns has been a result of the loss of the 2016 year.
The U.S. Department of Justice reported that there was no strong agreement with the Yultian News Act would be able to confirm the need to close the difference between the increase in the current view of the current view, as well as the difference between the non-discriminate markets.
The company said that he watched a total of the BIST 100 points that tested new records with 108.600 levels of BIST 100.
In particular, 109.500-110.000 areas are short-term crystals.
It's normal to get close to these levels.
We think it's supposed to be a local or global story for prices in short time.
For now, 107.500 support can trigger snow sell sales.
In this case, I think it's possible that if we follow the support of 107,000,105-105.
Especially the collapse of 105.500 support can bring back to 104.300 degrees together, which means that the rise from 108,000 to 108,000 levels of the rise is equal to 50 percent.
Both Fed and the European Central Bank (ECB) stated that expectations for FEB will be at the center of the global market, but the U.S. increase in FOMC can be measured in the United States even if the U.S. increase is not expected.
"What EB's going to say is what's important to say if it's what happens when it's the country in the region where it's going to be in the low-speed coastal area, where it's going to say, "What's important to say with you?"
Following the July money policy meeting, ECB asked President Mario Dragon to discuss money policy in the final phase, and this led to the 1,700 degrees of the euro/dolar Party.
Thus, reports that 60 billion eurosciences are going to be reduced or destroyed by the ECB next to the global scale.
"In the name of unequivocal prices for the country's marketing markets, which are so high-quality as Turkey's.
In November 2016, the U.S. President of the U.S. President of the U.S. announced that Trump had been a very serious political role in the United States after the presidential election of the United States.
It was said to indicate that this key element that Trump was expected to increase global growth due to the economic progress of the initial taxpayers:
Borsa Istanbul also took place at the head of those who went ahead in the World War II.
One of the most important reasons for this is that even though the BIST 100 units have been very hot in recent years, it has been beneficial to say that there is a significant role in supporting economics and financial markets.
Especially, we can say that it has a serious effect on the Kre Garantti Fun (KGF) that is now visible.
In the rest of the year, positive progress has increased to significant prices, and the KGF has slowed down to this level, while the UNT 100 gene continues to slow down into the same country markets, while the rest of the year has slowed down.
The plan to share the details for a long period of time, which has been called for 180 days, has been described to have contributed in support of the company's cards, such as a recent taxpayer.
As a result, the U.S. National Bank, F.A., and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (B.E.) argues that, while slowing down, it is still going to be a critical economic risk factor among countries, it is also necessary to increase the number of economic priorities that continue to take place for a long period of time, the FCD will be considered to be the most important solution to the U.S.
Gürcan, who said that this support area would continue to be a long-term crisis in the case of a population of 104.150-104.6000 support zones in the next year.
In the case of the 108.605 generators, which are still in the state of the current state and the current date, it is said that you can rise up until 110.100–112.

He said five soldiers and a interpreter were injured in NATO.
The unintended local sources say that three civilians died in the area in the Carababok region of the city.

My brother, Recep Tayip Erdogan, also announces the greeting of the Katar Emir.
The loss economy proved its resistance.
In many countries, economics have a negative impact on our economy.
We have to work hard to make Katar's independent and strong.
In hours we broke up in the big room because of Turkey's opposition to us.
We don't have any limitations right now.
The natural resources we have are helping to support the economy of Katar's natural economy.

According to the survey for economic losss, Can Akan Akun Hakun has not been a guest insurance insurance for 3 people, each of which has no blood insurance at any 2 employees, and says, "There are no risk insurances for three people."
As a result of the low insurance rate in our country, the risk of resisting serious damages from our citizens and institutions is growing every day.
All these assets shouldn't be left on the state.
Not as expensive as insurance policies are considered, but insurance is not just a sector that pays damage; it's also a risk management advice.
The increase in insurance and insurance rate is very important for our human and country.
"Kasko insurance usually needs to be reported in five days of work, and this time is over."

Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lochenko are meeting for the first time, they're seeing a possible discussion.
Whisyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were meeting with each other on Thursday for the next summer of 147 pounds.
The New World Space Council was in separate rooms in Los Angeles, until the World Boks Organization became the world's super-faculous champion in Los Angeles, to welcome Lomachenko.
On Saturday, on Saturday, with the votes of four former world champions, Adrian Broner, after winning Garcia's defeat, every one of the five warriors who had not been held.
Garcia reached his right hand and said, "How's he going, champion?"
Good luck with you."
Lomachenko will defend her belt on Saturday night against Miguel Marriaga.
While the two, Lomochenko's manager, Egis Klimar, who is the principal of the fighters, was the "military" of a potential fighter.
Garcia has reminded me of "I'm a old bunk."
"I went up to the top of the broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm a little small for 140.
I'd like to get in the fucking fuck.
That's a little bit too, then we can fight.
That's what the lizards want.
Let's give them this."
Lomachenko joined.
"The fight needs this fight."
Climas asked if it should be in the 'house and watching'; re-consumption with Garcia (37–0, 30 March) to set up a date and fight Lomchenko in an open opening this year; Garcia is a part of his strategy for a freshman's performance in the Forum in 23 September.
Garcia said, "The fight may be in "and watching, because all the sides want it." And then, if the channel offers the best financial package, it's clear.
We're real names.
No other name would be very interesting.
When they're ready...
Garcia said that Lomachenko was a "mazzam fighter" and could agree on Saturday.
But Lomachenko insisted on saying, "It's too slow" from Riverside, "I'm sorry, Mikey... you asked me to be a lawyer."
Garcia told me to show you the punch power of your room first.
They both said they felt that they were created for their own encounter.
"This is a fight to do.

It'll be a great fight."
>>uzb_Latn<< Turkey's Turkish republic
White House doesn't think of implementing Moscow's pipe lines, but they can't increase their resources to Russia.
The result is the increase in debt.
Kremlin, who was worried that the Western investors were concerned that they were not going to get rid of the projects, was able to speed up the construction of the pipe lines as a result.

The new results of Sweden's international age assessment test
In Sweden, the latest results of a new medical assessment test test, more than 80 percent of the participants who participated in the test, have the right to believe that these tests are true.
Sweden's National Medical & Medical Association (Rättsmediculture) began to do tests earlier this year.
The test was designed to make sure that some of the students who claimed to be acting in Sweden (Migristorsversity) failed to improve their age during the scientific period.
Until now, the Migrationsverke sent 6880 cases to test, and the Adulive Medical and Medical Department announced the end of the period from March 31, 2017 to March 31, 2017.
He did not decide whether 80 percent of his 80 (2002's) name was on it, and on 25 cases, he ruled that Adulive Medical and Medicine were "married on 18 and above."
In 432 cases, the person was probably under 18.
The tests were only made in cases where the age of age was suspects.
According to Johan Hayansson, from Ali medical department, the results are held in the past months.
"For many months, we don't see a big difference in statisticals, numbers are very tight."
It doesn't mean that the rate of cases was bigger than 18 years old, and that the rate of the rate of citizens was clearly lying about their age.
On the May 5,81 test, he explained, "the number of people being 18 years old or older" 442.
When Stevenska analyzed the results of the 581 cases explained by the Dagblade, 243 thus found that she was 18 years old this year.
The medical assessment method of monitoring the 20-year-old teeth and adding the MRI scans of the teeth, then examining the tooth and radiologies, is being criticized in some areas.
One of the birds is the founder of the Carolinska Institute of biotechnology, which evaluates the biotechnology of people who are working at the time of the meeting.
"I have reason to think about this, and I think it's not supposed to be the kind of measurement used.
It's very suspicious to make a decision like this.
If we can't say it, we shouldn't do it like that."
What's wrong is that you can say: "It's a small risk to say that a child is mature enough to have an adult."
The biggest risk is under 18 years of age, which is about 10 percent risk."

They're still here with originality.

One part thinks you chose Turkey for money.
What are you talking about?
The last thing I remember about Cuba was my national team.

And then I came to Turkey with the welcome of the Fenerbach club.
I'm going to the National Team, and he's been through the Fenerba.
They offered me an offer for the calendar.
I opened a new page with Turkey.
I had a lot of pain in my youth, but I signed a record in Rio and Amsterdam later.
I can't wait to do the best at the World Atticism Champion and make a different vote.
You were held at the press conference last time.
Can you tell us why?
When Turkey's having a question about having me, I'm thinking, I'm getting out of Cuba national team, 23 years old.
And of course, people in Turkey come close to me.
When I won gold medals at the European Champion in Amsterdam, I felt like playing the Spanish Marsh.
I couldn't keep my tears.
I'll thank Turkey for their opportunity to make my dream come true.
I'm so glad I belong to the Turkish National Team.
I'll be here until my legs run.
You said you'd be your Turkish boyfriend before.

Your girlfriend's also your assistant trainer.
You've been together all day, like feeding?
He eats more sweet than I do.
I don't actually say that I'm actually very tough, but it's just that I'm eating time.
My interpreter, Massimo Matrone, too often, has a hard warning, but I know it's for me to do it.
How does your boyfriend cook with Turkish food?
Turkish women do very good food, but my darling makes it even more beautiful.
(Laughter) And I'm the first choice.
THE SUEFENE
My trainer in Cuba didn't believe me.
I've got other young people.
After we won the medals for Turkey, we met in Cuba.
He showed me the young athletes before him and said, "I had a full measure of it."
I just laughed at him.

Coe commends Russia's wish for the doping scandal
Sebastian Coe, the boss of the Universal Attorney, praised Russia’s reputation as a formally defined Russian but pointed out that it was not right for the country to accept sports.
Russia's Attributionist Prime Minister Dmitry Shylakhtin said the IAAF Congress was right to be released from the Soviet Union, and it was determined to fight it with the full heart.
He said, "I'm sorry about all the athletes who have been forced by gold and silver medals."
In November 2015, the World Anti-Dopping Agency (WADAAA) voted to prevent the violation of law after finding a state-dependent agreement in Russia.
IAAF president Coe said to the reporters, "I think you're a very sincere, sincere presentation today."
"It's been glad to be a whole concert and all Congress... to make sure that the Russian Federation has passed through a lot of stolen days, and to make sure that the federation has been restored."
Coe also said Russia has a "mem".
"I think it's a very creative day, and I think it's been taken, but Congress supports that the power of the mission is not the right time for Russia's rights," Coe said.
"We have to do everything to improve this situation in the next few months.
It's always meant to separate clean athletes from the perfect system."
The West IAAF crisis is going to be an independent competition at the World Atletism Champion in London, where it will start on Friday.

The United States supports the elements of Arab Columbia (SDG) in the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDG).
The SAK is also fighting to clear the Sealand region and to restore their homes.
TYTA President Ermut: truly foreign investment will be on you last year
The TYDTA President Armut said that the total investment was 55% after the summer of 55 percent.
Ermut, who reported that 15 July FET was not limited to investors, said that there would be a greater increase, and he hit it."
Maybe we could see more increase if there were not any of these circumstances.
That's why we hope for the next year.
I hope it's gonna be a bright year when the investment really means it's going to be.
From the first five months of the year, we're going up to 11 percent for the first five months of the year.
But we don't find that enough.
"We hope it's going to be too much." He used his expressions.
"Global, if necessary, doesn't love us, we're trying to organize investors," Ermut said.
Ermut kept his words, telling me that 75 percent of the investors were from Europe until 2010.
This number is up to 66 percent.
Over 7-8 percent of Asia's price again.
Russia's market grew up.
While we were trying to do this, there's some problems between the Krefez countries.
Turkey has all the good relationships; especially Saudi Arabia and Katar two important actors.
But the problem between these two countries upset us, and in reality, investors are making their decisions a little more brief.
We can only live in Turkey, not because of investors.
Arda Ermut was aware of some events happened last week in Germany, but the government, especially the President Recep Tayip Erdogan, has shown clear and accurate response.
When they talk to the investors of the most violent political crisis, President Erdogan's reaction, "The problems are between governments, among the nations."
Secondly these people came in and worked in my country.
These aren't different from Turkish companies for us.
They're going to come to us when they're in the opposite direction. We're gonna solve it.
"We're not going to let them go." Ermut, who wants them to continue to support all the investors.
Ermut said, "We can give this confidence in the next time we've been here."
You will see that no German companies, no political or politics, investors from the countries that we live in.
The opposite is, we're going to do what we can to increase investments from these countries.
We think the investors from here will continue to increase.
Of course, political progress sometimes affects the environment of the investment.
"We're going to do what our investors want to do at this point, and our investors' interest in not affect the field of investment."
The TYDTA president Ermut said Turkey's big interest in China, but if the problems are solved by Körfez, they're waiting for the greatest rainforest.
"We've been in trouble with these relationships, and we've had no investors, and we don't even have a investor who used to say we're running." Ermut, who came here and kept track of what they were following.
Ermut said, "At this moment, about 10 percent of our projects are nearly German companies."
So the companies we've seen from around the world are almost 10 percent of the German companies.
Some of these are companies that still spread in Turkey.
He's got an investment or something to do, and he's looking at us as a project.
"The German companies are actually creating an important part of our daily activity," he said.
Ermut, who told Turkey that all state institutions should be careful and could be affected in the worst bad communication.
Ermut explained that last 2-3 weeks are a good lesson:
The day of politics with investors is always different.
We've always seen this; economic relationships always make political progress a way.
Germany will continue to remain our main trading partner and an important investor.
Because there's still a lot of investors in Turkey.
I'm afraid that the election day in Germany is increasing.
I think they're gonna be a little better when they get through.
Suudi is particularly concerned about not giving negativity in Arabic.
A investor who is investing in Turkey is investing in investing the entire environment market.
So it wasn't because of Saudi Arabia, but it's been a little slower because of the uncertainty in the region.
But we're still talking to these investors.
My personal opinion, investors are now waiting for a decision they can get faster.
We don't have the Suudi investor because of your crisis between Turkey and Saudi Arabia.
We still have Suudi investors, who are still living in Turkey, who's still on vacation here, who's seeing us all the processes we've been following.
Arta Ermut, knowing that the international investors from Turkey last year (UDY) are 12 billion dollars, "I think we're going to be going to pass this year.
He said, "How long we're going to pass, this regional development will affect global uncertainty."
When I hope that the effect that it is usually going to be more limited, Ermut said that the first five months might have been a bit more limited, and that if the first five months of the first five months, I'm saying, "I believe I'm going to be able to close the end of that year, or that's the end of the year."
Ermut, locomotive, safety, safety, safety, marketing, and new investors in the field of energy, energy, energy, and exports.
Ermut also points to the new investors who will be hearing in the next months, saying, "We can have an investment in the time of the year."
It's not a billion dollars, but it's a big investment.
"External investors can also be investors in the country."

How does football's financial rules affect Neymar's going to Paris?
The rules of European football clubs will not prevent the world transfer of Paris-Saint Germain from Spain's limited budgets.
The prestitious champions have the power to set up the League of League, the leader of the European board from UEFA to Paris Saint-Germain.
In 2011, the Finnish Adil game rules from the UEFA mean that at the end of the PSG would have to show Neymar's transfer without the loss.
Barselona paid 222 million euros (262 million) to buy Brazil outside the conference, and Neymar will be sentenced to ten million dollars in the year.
Some of Neymar's travel to France are:
When the team's money comes from the safe family, the PSG will sign up to Neymar and add it to the other stars' galaxy.
The club is allowed to pay for the player, but they also have to do so with the source of information that they can handle football's business.
FFP was designed after he was elected to the UEFA President of the United Nations in 2007.
The old French player believed that the club who was under the influence of making big debt on the success and that if the banks or its supporters put their support in risk.
In 2011, FFP began watching damages instead of focusing on clubs' debts.
The change meant that a club that was first used in Chelsea in 2003, which was first used in Chelsea (and created a global market) would be a more difficult one.
During the three-year-old FFP evaluation period of 2018, clubs can suffer from 30 million euros.
Although Platini was completely separated from the President in 2015, he was still determined to quit the Alekssander Cefer's failure in the UEFA.
Andrea Traverso, who manages the FEFAP, said last week to Associalized Press, said, "FFP is definitely not dead, and we will force the rules to move forward."
No matter how much PSG Neymar's purchase can be paid as a public contract for the legal reasons.
Neymer signed a 5-year deal, so the transfer fee could be considered 44,44 million euros in five years.
In 2014, the first wave of FFP was seen to apply to the most severe models of Manchester City, the PSG and Abu Dabin.
PSG was then sentenced to 60 million euros (82 million for the time), and ordered to limit the League team to 25 players for the 2014–2015 season.
UEFA's business has been a threat to companies who are willing to promote financial editors with the members of the club.
While a loss company may be offered to PSG, if the cost exceeds the standard market value, UEFA will not allow it to be considered as a right reward.
In 2014, the UEFA decided that the Katar Tortom Ottotis had been synonymous.
Some of Neymar's profits from PSG were reported that Katar's 2022 World Cup could pay off.
But PSG and Katar 2022 lied to Neymar as the World Cup, and it can easily be easily identified by the UEFA editors.
In the past, the use of PSG means that the UEFA will be more careful than trying to break the rules.
According to the report on Tuesday, UEFA is not in front of PSG with Neymar's transfer.
Because they were not able to talk about PSG's situation, they talked to The Associated Press.
The recent accounts show that PSG had more than 10 million euros with 542.4 million euros in 2015.
The accounts of the last Mali year have not been published yet.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to contribute to their sponsorship deals, gifts, and form sales.
The club is waiting to increase at least 30 percent after the signature has been removed.
He tried to prevent the PSPG from leaving one of the biggest players of football.
La League president, Javier Tebas Spanish newspaper AS's absolute possession of Katar's PSG, said "It's a 'malile doping' with the club and the state."
Arsenal manager Arsenne Wenger, who belonged to an American sports department, shares his concerns about the financial compensation of La League by a government.
"This is the result of having it, and it has completely changed all of football's poison in the last 15 years."
"When a country has a club once, everything is possible.
It's hard to respect the Financial Fair Play because it can be seen that such a great player can represent a country or have different interests.
>>uzb_Latn<< The 'tavan price' of insurances
According to the TSB data, the insurance sector has been damaged since 2006.
In 2015, the company damages 2.35 billion TTL in 2016, only 19 million TTL cards.
In Borsa Istanbul, the Anadolu Sigorta and the solar Sigorata are operating.
TSB said that the 1st year of the first six months of its results in 2017, 11 years in traffic insurance has reached 7.3 billion L, the damage of the train industry has reached 2.3 billion L.S. this year.
In view of the fact that 2015 numbers will be caught in this year, according to 2012 and 2015, the results of the loss of the other brunts are also significant, "We're also increasing the price of the citizen's home policy."
"In a 75 percent of the sector's population, our partners from abroad, have won a bad driver in a sense," he said.
The mountains went on:
We don't have any money from traffic, but we can't show us that we've been spending 11 years in the past.
He said, "We accept it, but we hope that if we can carry it in a central setting, we can carry it with the other politicians."
"In 2012, about 30 percent of traffic congestions have increased in traffic insurance, nearly doubled in 2015, and we wrote our history's biggest damage."
He said, "At the end of 2016 our wife was only 19 million TTL."
"We're going to put the good driver's price on a good driver's price in the next year"
He said, "but the treasure is looking at the general way, when is the last word in June," he said.
The June 2015 survey revealed that the increased growth rates of mass traffic signals in primordinary primies affect a large percentage of the population, from April to April 12 to April.
So, according to this, every tool associated with the hard traffic insurance policy was determined by a group of staffs, pressure, and traffic corruption, in some countries, in which they have been identified for severe traffic insurance insurances.
On the other hand, through July's introduction to a heavy traffic insurance company, the "Riskal insurance companies" program has been living.
Prim and damage, between insurance companies associated with traffic insurance in the pool.
These insurances will be identified by the Prime Ministership.
In the first six months of 2017, the tavan prim was estimated to be 11.5% of the production of prim production, while the population increased by 4.9 million, and the rate of the population increased to 8.6 million in the population, the distribution was nearly 30 percent.
"This ceiling can't be harmful with prices.
How much more could the sector carry this damage?"
"Why don't I feel like it's a bad driver in Turkey, because I feel like I'm going to win a poor driver's car in nine billion dollars, when every company in the sector is destroyed by 2.3 billion.
He said, "We're trying to tell what we're saying at this point."
In response to a question of whether strangers came to the area of Turkish insurance, they said, "They didn't come to that point."
They're waiting to invest more investment in Turkey, because in Holland there are six polypeptides in Turkey, which is 1.3.
"To Turkey is a place to grow in real sense," he continued:
So they're not leaving here.
However, the company has a high priority every year, but he is using it to make the company grow up in the world.
According to the TSB data, in 2016, prim production in the sector became about 40.5 billion dollars in the first half of the year, with 12 percent increase in the first half of the year.
The rings said that the sector would not finish with 15% growth in the total prim production of the sector.

Nostalji, she's in touch with "Salk American Writing" and "The Young Detective."
So for the '80s, 'The State' for the '90s, 'The State' for the '90s, 'The State', 'The State' for the '90s' period, and so for 2001, the stars are Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, and Paul Rud's saying that this is the case.
As a cultural product, it's also about the development of our regular Facebook period.
But as a serial, it's like it's out of time.
"The first day of Camp's Day" was successful, and it was not only because of abizit table (in fact, it was found a story that relates to the roots of a box called by H. Benjamin).
He was primarily interested in funnyness (the only way to recapture the past part of the story of the old actors who played a rhetoric) was to be able to recapture the past part of the story.
Now that adults play "The Year later" is less emotional, and the 90's includes the monologue film, including the "September El".
At one point, a character, a Apple Powerbook, some one-wheeled passengers, and a lot of other things from '1991'.
Most of the main stories are the same.
The soft heart is a writer, and it's still not forgotten about Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Mariano) still hasn't lost his debt.
There is also a plan of another crazy traitor that Rond Reagan (who was shot by George H. W. Bush) who was very well held by Michael Ian Black) and was involved in Rond Reagan's relationship with Mr. Showalter.
It's the best part of the series as always.
Especially nice to see the young Mr. Ruddd, who has always got the right six of Matt Dillon's lips in the "Belars", which seems to be the most popular child of the old school.
This series can be a random argument (for example, "Sween Up!" series of "Sween Up!") until I think I'm a logical consequence of something I thought it was, "The English American writing: twenty years later, "The Year of Year" is going to see a friend's film in the final stage.
In the meantime, a different nostalgia type in Amazon, "The Americans' Social War Review, movie "Siring Bomba" and even "GLOW" against the Western voice."
The code created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanacaka appears to be Rhys Thomas's found TV: the real, true, atheistism and Marxist-Lenist road.
The roles are played by the Kurt Gregor and the idealist Iosef, Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, their dialogues are made by Channing Tatum (he is also a leader).
That's a very bright idea.
But that's not much more than that idea.
There's some nice visualness (as Americans watch football watching the cops spend time watching chess on TV)
There's also a good tool for the "sense knower" game, which is also a popular broadcaster, Jenny Slette, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloèvis; and the play is a good tool for "sens"
But "The Young Detective" refers to the reality of a simple propulsion, which means that a killer (such as the Ragan mask) is mostly playing like it.
He doesn't know how to cross six lengths, and the comedy isn't too fast or too often.
When Gregor and Ioseoff regularly visited the American embassy of a plant that was always opened in the locomotive, "The Golding Detett" could do better in the proponent if the proponents were able to handle the case.
It can turn a message to a Communist audience to make a message to the Western culture to defeat anything as a serial.
Human creation was not wrong: we're doing it in our own past and even in their own past.
The Father of FET
The British government has seen that our family is loyal and generous for fifty years of experience.
The Supreme Court agreed that this family has been connected to the British government since then and has been established in large services.
The English government must be reasonable and careful about this expression of his own hands, carefully examining everything, and carefully deciding.
While working to understand FET, as the initial point of view of Mahashanas is taken, there is a difference between the fact that the elaboration of the EET is an emperist and is an organization that appears in the emperist period.
It's the "neutral movement" that should be taken in this moment.
In his English praise, Mirza Gearm Ahmet is the ruler of the English government.
"In December 188, 1888, a member of India's small town told Queen Ahmed that he ordered him to take property from God's people and create a meeting."
In 1891, H. Ahmed said that he died as a result of his death as a Christian and a Muslim.
This means that the Muslims are the same person as the Muslims who expect to be, and this is Miza Hamed.

In view of the fact that the government and the government are united in itself, the idea that the peace of the congregation will be the salvation of the Church, as it meant only to be in conflict with the FETET, is often the way to develop and spread through the community.

Let's note that women are shining as a show of the meeting in England with 30,000 people last week.
One of the slogans is a brief look at the dates of the historians who said, "Always rejoice, don't hate anyone."
It is possible to travel the origins of both the FET or the TET Kadri and the motivators and their motivators, and all of these organizations are supported by the use of emulations to serve the seismicism.

The NHS should discuss 10,000 people with HIV medicine.
In high court, after a conflict with the financing in the NHS, patients can get through the 'dvisor' HIV predication treatment month.
The NHS England heard that high risk risk rates have increased at 86 per cent of the risk of infection (PrEP) was expected to be provided by the health care provider (PrEP) for about 10,000 years prior to a three-year-old trial.
The Supreme Court agreed to fund the test after his last year's approval of the Temyiz court, and in accordance with the claims that NHS was able to repay the local authority for PEP.

In London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool, and Sheffield, sexual health clinics are going to be the first recorded clinics, with more clinical participation in England on April 2018.
A series of HIV capacitors that lower the risk of HIV before the sex.
The experiment showed that PrEP reduces the HIV transfer of HIV between those with risks.
Before sex, PrEP means that a person has enough medications to prevent HIV infection in his body.
This kind of medicine can be taken for two hours before you're having sex every day or sex.
The gay or bisexual men, trans-positive people and HIV-positive partners and fail treatment.
Clinics, men, men, women, and partners will be able to recognize that HIVs of anti-retroviral treatment will be acceptable to those who are aware that they are treated with anti-retrial treatment.
Those who live in England and who are registered in a pratisite can also be registered for their post-medication in local sexual clinics.

If the needs and risks are set properly, the PrEP may be offered to convert the HIV attack in England.
From September to September, those who take up high risk will be able to reach a new and strong relationship with the NHS by the NHS in England; this will lead to the recovery of many lives.
We meet this message in a warm way."
Terrence Higgins Trust said, "The experiment should be made fast by the country's country and no one should be left behind.
The PrEP experimenter now claims that we are on the way to protect more than 10,000 people who have risked HIV.
Shadow's health doctor Sharon Hodgson said, "We welcome the experience of the PrEP and have been late for months, and the government's feet are late.
The evidence shows how much this medicine can be converted to as part of our reaction to preventing HIV, and how much this infection can be converted to the end of life.
It'll get us a step further to understand the benefits of PrEP.
Now it's important that this experiment be presented as fast as possible in the country to protect the remaining ones and complete HIV in the community so that we can reach a closer step.

An ambulance and a police team were called instead to report the death penalty and police team that had been located in the city of China in the 19th and not heard from him for a while.
The health team decided that the Chilingiroglu had lost his life on the 19th floor of the 19th floor.
"There was a depression in the time when the police said to the police."
On 31 July, he came to Istanbul from Ankara.
I have a patient patient with my other daughter.
He said, "He was interested in my grandson and had a negative impact on my grandson's illness."
It's expected to be tried in Ankara, the Chilingirogul, raised in Aduli Medical.

Another suspect in Istanbul was born in Yellowyer Zekerakyköyy.
He was found dead in the house of Melis Salihoglu (24).
According to claims, the father of a young girl went to her home near the school where she couldn't hear the news and no news of her cell phone.
Dad, he met her lifeless body at home.
His family, who loved him so much and loved by his friends and friends, gave him his life to live in Melis's house.
The death of Melis Salihogul was banned by his family and relatives.
A friend of Melis's after a friend of his in social media said, "There's a day when a bright star hits us."
It was a pleasure to be walking with your best friend Jack and your sister, Euzan, who was following the plastic ball under our feet.
He shared the message of "the death" now.
Living life: The House floor and smart design numbers have transformed these little Earls Courts into a beautiful house.
In 2014, former banker Joanne Leigh, a large house in Knightsbridge, went to flight to the apartment in Earls Cout.
It's an evidence of a new design that is convinced that Queen Anne's style is in the first floor of a scan and that Joanne is convinced.
"Before this, my ex-husband and I lived in a bigger area in Knightsbridge." Joanne says.
"I was looking for something to say to my price.
The apartment in Earl Court was shown to me, and they had the same high rank.
I fell in love with him, and I gave him a offer that day."
After the first meeting, 1000 ft square feet were renewed.
In the beginning, there was only one room and a complicated plan; you had to go through the kitchen to reach your bedroom, and Joanne wanted to add a hidden area to the maximum advantage of the generous ceiling.
"I wanted big windows, big windows, and a lot of light.
That's my neighbor."
With this goal, Notting Hill's central architect and design studios held Erfan Azad from Duck & Shed to take the 125 ft away and not just one structure to create Joane's life.
The ceiling wasn't too high enough to add two tops, so the architecture would have to create an asthma that you could stand up.
Erfan would have understood the creative way to solve the problem.
"The skeleton is very complicated."
"We should have set things up like this so that they can get together before they don't need to walk down on each other.
It wasn't just a simple platform building, but the flowers would also have to be equal to the top or bottom function."
This arrangement has made Erfan get two-dimensional rooms on each other.
It's an old-type window taken from Retrouius for the floor. It looks at the amazing life area.
The gold-colored mobiles, silver shots, and the old Serge Mouille's design is determined by the design of the whole body.
The use of mirrors plays a role in the mechanism, field, and lighting of light.
The mirrors that are placed on both sides of the corridor make it look longer.
In the kitchen the mirror panel gives the window open to another room.
In Antre, the fan members of Joanne's entire casino knife and the area where he kept it in his pocket.
The beauty of the living room that created a wonderful field, the beauty of the room, when it's not in use.
The closed kitchens are not new.
If that's what's about, there's a door that can be raised up in the garage.
Erfan explains that we've used a multi-tech engineering door that's powered with steel.
"There's a heavy weight, so when you push up the door, it's really easy."
With the use of Alan and his hiding area, Joanne won a 16-mile bedroom, and a clean seat plan.
"What you're going to sell at the end of the day, or your property's worth." Erfan says.
"As a member, an embassy will enter into the office and will make an account in some session."
They've managed to use the quality materials to produce the size of the gas field here.
"Malfans are objects that you touch and thus help you make emotional connection at home."
"You won't fall in love with electric lines on the wall.
These are important things, but your hearts do not tremble.
This is the basis for a well design and a building that can be transformed into something really wonderful from a standard thing.
Actually, like Joanne, you can choose not to leave.

The brothers fight for the $500 million government empire
Two brothers are at war for one of Victoria's biggest embassy empires, which is worth more than $500 million.
The former Carlton Football Club director and the engineer Colin De Lutis, who lived away from Paul, a small brother who gave himself to the highest court in Toorak.
Paul wanted to get out of his family business since 2014, but there were strong disputes in the Supreme Court about separation.
His parents, Anna and his brothers, Smith Street, were more than 38 billion estates from a shop they had received in Collinswood in 1973.
There, the family set Westco Jeans and raised him in a chain of sales centres at 160 per minute.
It was sold to $85 million in 1999.
This money was sold to the property, and De Lutis's portfolio now includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorento private sectors, Gold Coast and Mt Buller Islands, and banking centers.
In a contract made with his father, Colin (Paul by De Lutis) described as "one of the most powerful forces and a complete human being" in his company, Paul has three men.
A court file says Colin's $36 million, and Paul has a property worth 176 million.
It comes as a matter of conflict to Paul's property and cash distribution.
In 2015, he said, "The disengagements offered by Colin gave him leave it to the property that I always cared for as best."
The last week, after a lot of failure, the first highest court was approved.
The brothers are also fighting against who would control the existing work; Paul claims that Colin left herself alone.
Colin defends that it's not true, but he blames Paul for some of his possessions.
Colin says he hopes to solve the conflict.
"My Italian roots confirm me that family is the most important priority."
Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, and Charter Cramer's firms have been written by hundreds of pages, including e-mails and Allan Myers, and the best lawyers, and both by the QC.
Ms. De Lutis and her husband, Luigi, were a family of Italian immigrants who worked in the late 1950s, and bought a shop in Brunswick at the beginning of the 1970s.
Colin's first collingwood shop, they've filed his possessions to buy his property.
Colin says, "In my last year of high school, Paul built Westco when he was a little boy."
Anna De Lutis, who died in 2012, says that Luigi was hoping to leave her children with friends.
"Luigi often told me that brothers never want to go to court."
The other two brothers Mark and Luke are no longer part of the de Lotus team; and Colin said that when Colin left his job, he'd pay Mark $10 million to Luke, and Luke's $226 million.
Paul said that Luke and Mark were "not satisfied with the terms of financial differences."
According to Eddie McGuire, a biographer of the television star, Eddie McGuire, who was a former AFL club member, he tried to ignore.
Fairfax made contact with Media, Colin, and Paul De Lutis and his lawyers on Friday.
Just because Colin was in court with a short message, he replied, "I can't say anything."
"My brother Paul prefers to sue me, and he's very sad that our family's name is being put into court."
In the middle of 2016, Colin wrote that his brother was trying to carry out his demands.
"Our father, Paul and I didn't want us to deal with the current conflict," he added, "and he added that he's still hoping for my marriage."
It looks like this hope is missing on Friday.
"We're going to be solved by the courts in the near future."
Trump's new private pen is planning to reduce the media.
Others tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly really can do that.
It'll be the first.
Politicco claims that the new White House will be able to extend the information flow to President Trump (such as the media reports) to the boss.
Some little information from the reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When Mr. Saray's new personal secretary, John F. Kelly, was in the first day of his work, the President Donald Trump decided to resolve the White House: the bad information was taken to the president's side.
Kelly told me that the information should be flowed through him on paper or on paper, because the president could make better decisions when given good information.
Kelly's reputation makes sense, but others tried to keep Trump on the media and failed.
President Trump's relations with television decades ago, and he's still in the White House, watching TV.
"If Aday Trump, mediamp, I'd be given to show him the right place in the media if he didn't get a good place," said Sam Nunberg, former campaignerg.
"At the time, according to Tara Palmeri from Poland's campaign officer, Trump's key to controlling Twitter's competitive competitive flow of my personal media industry," he wrote.
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter used to be "constructured" at any time.
Maybe the campaigners know something that the rest of us don't know, like Trump's tweets, they're going to be more grilling.
We'll probably never know anything about the Tweets Trump didn't send.
If his men could get him out of a dangerous danger several times, then his efforts were worth it.
But no one could prevent Trump from creating a constant argument.
Some of the problem was that White House was trying to move forward with each other, in any case their agents were safe or untrustworthy, and they were able to prevent their own world's views.
In the summer of Politico, all this story reported the attempt to inform the rest of the consultants as a strategy for the rest of the story.
The reporter described the details of Shane Goldmacher:
"Mevutt and former Trump officers have shown themselves to the unsatisfactory pests, especially the bad effects of Trump, and where they are exposed.
At the end of the day, another member of the Internet provider, Charles C. Johnson's website, a private pen assistant, Katie Walsh, accused of being "the source of a series behind the front line" in the White House.
Johnson's main concern was that he had been banned from Twitter because it was illegal or did not present any evidence, or has been made false charges in the past, and had been turned away from them.
Trump read the article, and he started asking questions about the perpersonale Walsh."
Goldmaxer then added that the private pen was renice Priebus and White House guard Rob Porter was trying to set up a system where the documents were taken and documented.
How did this happen?
Kelly's trying to do the same three months later.
Maybe it will appear as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump's still running for his own gun and his assistants.
These changes will make Kelly's mission really difficult.
The Krypto FETs came up with a special template
"Sarmakk" was launched by the Ministry of the Ministry of Justice in the Department of Justice in the Department of Defense when he published a investigation of methods of "Sarmacic investigations" in the investigation of the methods of "Sarmishk" in which the law of the State Council of Human Rights has begun to say that the President of the United Kingdom was President of President Person General President of FEEEE".

And there's another way that the FETETs are there, and the charges against the accused.

Italian STKs are pushing the approach to foreign rescue bots
Italy warned STCKs that if they don't follow the new rules that influence their operations, they will not be allowed.
"If the STCs don't fit in with the new boat, they'll be forced to continue their activity," said Minister Marco Minniti, Tornoi, Torno newspaper La Stampa.
The Minniti's warning came back one day after the doubt that it would make it easier for a boat, the German aid manager, Jugend Reetttett, to make it easier for people to work together as an unofficial company.
Only for a year, the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio refused to comment on the contents of the separate charges against them.
"We're sorry that we can't be able to save our lives for ourselves, and that's why we can't work right now in the search and rescue area."
"But we can only evaluate the charges that are done now after we can collect all the information and evaluate the situation.
The Italian authorities were watching Jugend Reett's boat from my team from my day to month.
The crew's suspects they've taken them into the plastic boats that have been delivered by human refugees and that the refugees have allowed them to flee to the boats, and re-use them again.
According to the files published by the Italian media, at least the same meeting was reached at 1.3 miles in the district of Libya.
The crew is under obligation to respect the authority of the Italian coastal security of Italy, because of the efforts of many other human efforts to save lives in the region.
According to salt, there was to be a Italian police officer who looked at their activity in the West of Iuventa.
Only three of the nine STCs in search and rescue operations have agreed to fit: Save The Children, the central MOAS, and Spain.
The last day of these, on Tuesday, he said that new rules are not necessary but that they can be accepted because there will not be any "civic change or failure" in his own rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign are the Nobel Prize General Doctors (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said that during the last few weeks of rescues in Italy, a sharp fall in the number of immigrants who came to Italy has shown that the efforts of Libya's field security are a sign of the growth of cooperation with local citizens and local citizens.

Michelle Carter was punished because of the messages that Conrad Roy had attempted to commit suicide
A woman from Massachusetts had been sentenced to two and a half years since she was threatened to commit suicide by sending her boyfriend letters and telephone conversations.
Michelle Carter, now 20-year-old, will take 15 months behind his sentence, and five years from prison.
Carter was accused of being killed by Conrad Roy on July 13, 2014.
Mr. Roy's father spoke on Thursday night, saying, "My brother's heart is broken.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free to be clear.
Even though his court team and Mr. Roy were paid for a 20-year sentence, he confirmed that he and his wife were paid from their mental illness.
Carter, who wears a red pants and cream blonde, looked at the old eyes and eyes.
The prosecutor said, "He killed Conrad Roy by his actions."
He ended his life in order to heal himself.
He didn't accept the charge."
"He didn't show that he felt regret."
But Carter's lawyer said, "It was a terrible thing that his country had regret all of it."
He said that he didn't see any significant impact on his brother's age levels, even mental health.
Mr. Roy's mother read a statement to Lynn Roy, saying, "I don't have one day to mourn my dear son's loss.
I want to be proud of how I'm going through everything, and I'm trying to be with all of her sisters for all eternity."
Mr. Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, told her sister that she could never join her brother's brother's wedding or that she would never be able to give her children the truth.
"You've always been with me all the time since I was born," she said, "and there's a pain that will always be with me in the rest of my life."
It seems that there is no legal need for a court to create a case because of the crime of telling a person to commit suicide.
Mr. Roy was 17 when he died of carbon monoxide poisoning in 2014.
The case was a national interest when Carter's short messages encouraged Carter to end his life.
When he was on vacation with his family, he said two weeks before his death, and he said to them, "Be kind to yourself in a building and I don't know how many ways to fly."
Before his suicide, he wrote, "You must do this, Conrad" and "the generator you need to be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said he wanted Carter to take care of Mr. Roy's death by allowing him to get out of this case.
The case was divided into court views.
About two years before the defense of Carter, he was found guilty of killing his British friend in Italy in 2007.
"Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not pills."
It's a guess of the amazing growth of the Spirit.
He said that in Turkey, the inflammation needs to be taken into the low-engine numbers, and that the food is created "science zone".
The Prime Minister suggests that the inflation will fall under 7% in 2018.
He said these words in his warm speech:
Our next 12 months are critical in the decline of the disorders.
The biggest reaction is to reduce the disadvantages.
There's a powerful government.
There's no political uncertainty.
I hope it'll be a little less than our close neighbourhood.
I believe we're going to take a step train on Turkey's 5%.
I said it months ago.
Because the worst is left behind.
It's slower, not to those fields, but to the reforms that enable us to develop energy, to increase energy.
That's why the next 12 months are critical.
One way, reform, one way of uncertainty is that there's no political uncertainty.
I hope our luck will get out of here, and the problems in our nearby neighbourhood will be reduced.
Even if we don't want it, there's a lot of our classic market down.

We're not just losing Sundays, but we're dealing with the ship waves over 3.5 million.

Now, by increasing our chances against violence, we're going to take more of the questions on the head of the investors, and we're sitting on Turkey's raise policy on 5%.
I'm telling you, we have this generous retirement system.
If I tell you that retired companies don't have enough effort, I think it'll be worth it.

Why?
Because we took measures.
The firms don't have to go and make a lot of effort.
We've been playing in the way we're looking at these concerns, taking care of how global resources are weak.
You know, you know, bringing them up.
One time, the government's 25 percent, there'll be a performance in there.
The rest of the vegetarians are usually risked in their treasure papers.

That means we're very optimistic.
The system works once.
We brought a prime roof.

They made their primies so fast.
When we asked what's going on, they said that the judge's decisions did not pay attention to the current arrangements.

We said that's not how it's going to happen.
We've got the idea here.
Of course, when they got into this tavan prim application, some firms refused.
We've made a new arrangement.
We've created the risk insurance pool.
Let me tell you that, I'll do it again.
I'd prefer this system to work in a competitive way.
I mean, I'm not going to find out the prices of these ceiling prices, they're forced to have us.
I'd like to see this three-dimensional thing.
The system we do is take care of.
Two, the system is normal, it's a price in that path.
He carries heavy burden on him, every 100 lipid primin nearly 30-31 rounds of taxpayers.
I'm working right now, we're going to talk to our minister.
Thirdly, technology is growing rapidly.
Now it's also designed to reduce traffic accidents seriously.
But it's hard traffic insurance.
"The man of ARAH has saved his leg."
But today, it has been a challenge for some men to have been seen by the ages of puberty, and it has become increasingly common in women.
One of these women is 36-year-old Mehtap.
Two years ago, the headaches started in the footprint.
The young woman who was forced to walk was in the hospital when she was forced to lose her leg.
He suggested Dr. Joseph Kalko.
"Azerbassan has saved the life of the Middle East Minister" in the United States.
So he came up with Dursun's battle against Berger's disease.
Prof. Dr. Kalko took the young woman to an emergency surgery.
Dursun who survives his pain in a short time, now sees oxygen treatment.
On the other hand, the automotives are going to give the answer to the U.S.
One day before Audi's hearing, BMW said he'd give over 350,000 equipment.
The UNW board said that the U.S. President (as opposed to the ban or limiting of the UMW), including Munih, believed that the European cities were more intelligent than the "faculous limits" of the firm.
He said that on Tuesday, three million Mercedes in Europe were going to set up their diploma.
None of the firms have been identified as calling these moves back.
European automotive producers have encouraged the use of diesel tools to help combat carbon dioxide emissions in Europe and the United States.
But the calcium oxidation of motors is called cancer, and can cause my asthma.
It also increases the amount of equipment that the automotive firms have to do with the
While confronting the German automotive producers, the government of Angela Mercel's government has also been accused of showing strong automotive companies and looking for orders of the problem.
The firms are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes during the time that he is using the device as a false device, and when an automotive device is tested as a device.
A lot of Volkswagen's manager has been accused in the United States and others are under investigation in both sides of Atlantic.
Last month, the former president of thermodynamics was arrested in Germany.
The former director Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, a Italian and so on, could be held in charge of the United States of the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was moved into a German crisis, including Volkswagen, who charged the U.S. government with a system of embassy to get rid of the emissions in Europe.
Audi's involvement in the investigation can be hard to Volkswagen: Luks is an extensive market in Volkswagen's profit.
Don't throw fish every time you see
Turkish Neurocurrist Republic President Prof. Dr. Joseph Sükrör, who was not sure of the depth of his depth, warned him not to go fishing on the mountains of 2 metres.
Each year, thousands of people face the dangers of obesity because of falling into cold water.
The leg breaks up at least 5 or 6" o'clock.
The characteristics of the broken ones are also affecting the nerves that feed the arm and leg muscles in this level.
"It's the most precious part of our body in these storms, which is the most precious organ of our own body, is cut down by an ommaga, or is being separated from the lungs," Prif.
He said, "The wrong help in public injuries is the only help that does not increase the damage in the accident, and it can lead to death.
It's the fourth place to fish fish, when they're observative wounds.
The age rate of wounded is 20-29 and most of them are male.
Prof. Dr. Wounds don't have to fish without visible water.
He said, "No matter how good the waves are, it can be a heavy relief."
Prof. Dr. Witches also remind you of these:
The damage caused by fish can result in when it causes injury, depending on the size of the mucus and legs.
You may know my face, but water may be deceptive.
The place that looks deep for you might be a hole.
In the United States and Australia, the warning boards on the shores of the sea coast were reduced to 70 percent of the time when they were forced to fish.
"There is no sign of a single warning outside Istanbul, even though Dr. Chops have been found in Turkey for 28 years.
"It is necessary that every year every year in health care, schools, and social status project should be found in the fields and pools of information or information panomys."
TRAK Neuroscience Department of Neuroscial and Peripheral Cerrazi General Prof. Dr. Kat Kutil suggested that the wounds were performed:
The first thing in the event is 112.
The body must be kept as stable as possible, not moving, with a hard bow.
The air should be placed on the surface, and the patient must be exposed to the residue of the water that runs through the flow.
He shouldn't be forced out of his legs and shut up the water.
It shouldn't be trying to fix the shape of the patient's neck.
They may have broken their legs.
But if the spine has not yet seen damage, the first help and the patient's move may cause the disintegration of unicycles to attack the omnibilization of bone tissues and damages.
Under the threat of the provincial lavance climate change
It was a symbol of Provence in south France, but there is a warning that the climate change was under threat.
Lavender lives in fall because of such conditions as droughts, disease, and disease, and it causes scientists who try to find a solution to this situation to scientists and farmers.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the National Research Institute, said: “The lavance in Proverence is extremely dangerous because plants have been affected by the effects of rain in the early stages, most often in the early spring.
This affects the lives of the van.
There's also a small nettus kidney that is damaged by microtubules, and it's too much of them in the dry air."
And many things are in danger.
It's also going to be a fan of the lavanta bed for as much as he pulls out the tits as he pulls them off.
Eric Chaisse said, "We have little, small, or weak, or no weakness.
I mean, we've got less fat pieces of oil."
It's a better way to slow down water distribution and the soil, but it's also a protection for plants and water mixing and building fresher species.
The newspaperer's murder is drawing gold from the magic threat in Mexico.
The weekly newspaper Riocese meet the generals for reviewing the latest crime, illegal officers, and non-communications plans to take place in the newspaper.
But in this day, they came together to talk about their own tragedy.
They told them that it was important that they change their lips.
Two senior journalists see what makes it more safe: bringing their children in a office with them, or leaving them at home in 2009 with their children.
Security experts wrote three words on the black throne in front of the room: the poor, the weak, the allies.
The reporters want names for each column; they don't need any evidence, they don't need evidence, they don't need evidence.
Pharmaceuticals, politicians, men of business, or cartels, suspects that a list of journalists is dangerous enough to write Mexico's calories on paper.
There are no violence, more than the populations in the country, and more than that: According to President Enrique Pena Nieto Island, U.S. President Enrique Nieto has at least 25 people since the U.S.A. in 2012, under attack, and after the threat of threats, there are at least 25 people who have been killed in that year, and it has been estimated that there are at least seven more.
Among the last ones, the writing managers and inspiration sources of Riodoce have a partner, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
Valdez says, "The big mistake is to live in Mexico and become a journalist."
His lack is deep, but his presence depends on a large picture of Valdez's middle finger on the front of Riodoce's building; two reporters in the 30s, Aaron Ibarra, and Miriam Ramirez, who wears his smile, his beauty, and his appearance.
It's about two months before his death; reporters are talking about common traumas, nightmares, sleep disorders, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor was formed in 2010 to take the case of the journalists, the Gazettes had just fired the two of them under the Coruma Committee.
Each year, as many thousands of journalists are involved in drug trafficking and organic crime, journalists are taken in front of their killers.
In Riodoce, even though their hearts are broken, they insist on the violence at Sinaloa.
Ibarra says you don't know about the killers, without justice, is doing a little less work to talk about security.
He says, "It's stupid to spend my time at this job."
"As long as we don't know why, you don't trust anyone."
On May 15th, Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacan.
The Red Toyota Cololla was only spent a few blocks before it was stopped by two men; it was forced out of the vehicle, and was shot 12 times, for the name of the newspaper published by the Onikin River.
The armed man took his car away and hit the car nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
His wife and two grown children.
In Cuciacan's desire to walk free.
But there's nothing but silence about Valdez.
Last year Guzman's arrest and his return to the U.S. was one of the most blood war zones in the country to fill the void.
Make sure every day one or many people are killed or killed in the street every day in Sinaloa.
For a minute, forget the situation of the "supervised" state that only only one cartel's valuable portals and the U.S. trade route to the United States.
Even though Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Riodoce's co-found partner and manager Imail Bjoorquez (60), he was guilty of his failure to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes are involved in murder.
First of all, one of Guzman's opponents who fought in battle with the sons of Guzman had an interview with Damaso Lopez.
The sons of this summer may have been angry; probably the gang members of the press have sold every witness to the newspaper flags.
The second mistake was that after the same story was taken to another newspaper, Valdez was forced to leave the country for his own safety.
Waldez was a legend outside Mexico and its murder was considered an intense turning point against the journalists.
For a long time, his friends and colleagues believed he'd always be there.
He was an experienced reporter in Noroeste in 2013 when he spent 50 dollars on his five business friend Riodoce's discovery.
"It was impossible to become a journalist without regard for drugs," said Bojorquez.
In time, the newspaper gained a reputation for courage and honest news, and the advertising increased.
The reporters loved to publish life research without fear and read and read stories that could not encourage anyone to report.
Riodoce won the Presbyterian Maria Moors Carbot prize for hearing in Latin America eight years later.
Even the same year, Valdez gained the courage to stop and stop the Mexican drug story, so the Gazetters won the International Basin Freedom of Freedom.
He obviously admitted you were scared.
During the CPJ awards, he said, "I want to keep going."
In a interview with Rommeviento TV, he said that drug breakthrough is "one life style."
"As a journalist, you have to accept the responsibility that comes from you, or you'll play an idiot.
I don't want you to ask me why you didn't tell me what's going on so many deaths?
Riodoce miss Valdez, who knows how to stay alive.
They trusted his Truine.
He always wears his hat.
El Guayabo, who was in front of the office, went to the bar and always sat on the same table.
Now they ask: Did his love for her lips break down?
His death forced them to question their own claims about how they're doing the best and how they're going to survive.
"If you're trying to do evil with their wives, their children, their hands, the things they used to do, they don't like it."
Bojorquez said, "It's over the border."
The result was even a high-level autosansis and self-efficacy.
Trust your own instincts.
If bad smells come to you, stay away.
Riodoce writes, author Andrew Willerreal, "It's a story that's been cheating... and something happened to Javier."
He and others say that the old rules in Singapore are not true; the same Tamaulipass, Veracricus, Guerrero, and a famous collabor, are no longer in the other state where there is a family of poor institutions, weak institutions, and evil officials.
It's still changing.
In the room that Riodoce was meeting for security training, no cell phone was allowed; days ago, the spy software was used to monitor the journalists and activeists in Mexico.
Two police officers outside wanted to get rid of the heat of a tree in the shadow of a tree.
They were elected by the State government to protect its office in a four-party office in the middle class of Riodoce's middle class.
Half-fively serious, some of the reporters wondered if the governor had said that the government was not safe by 50 percent.
The reporters have gone for months to the mountainous zone that the drug gangs have controlled.
At the end of this week, Riodoce's moving three main stories.
The old boxwriteo Cesar Chavez's brother had a murder in Sinaloa.
And there was also a violation of government spendings under the government's supervision.
And there was a group in Cuiacan's most expensive restaurant in the defense.
There was no clear explanation about who was kidnapped or how it was, so when everyone in the city had time to write it: the restaurant and the occupants and the occupants of the restaurant.
One reporter found out that the restaurant had been registered under the name of the Kurimal Democratic Party (PRI) of the last 100th century state.
In recent times, many PRI governors have been falsely accused of wrongdoing.
Villareal asked the reporter what happened before one of the sons of Guzman's sons ran into a military raid.
Only months ago, they looked at Valdez's side for the best source of information about being kidnapped.
"We already knew what's going on, "El Flaco" is."
"All of our communication channels are now cut off."
While the personnel never expected to wait, Valdez's office is again used as a deployment for protesting journalist murders and removal.
The reporter Miriam Ramirez closed a couple of points and went to show another journalist in the office of the local prosecutor.
El Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the state of Miocaccan.
There was a burning body and official officers say it was him.
In the country, journalists expressed their thoughts in a higher voice by saying "helping the building" in organic Protestants and building buildings.
Today, director Bojoorquez is trying to provide international support for justice in Washington, Valdez.
During a meeting with Valdez's death, Ramirez was accused of being spying on the journalists and killing them because they were telling the truth.
From that day until then, thinking that the anger had weakened, he wanted to be assigned to the government rather than to carry out his message.
Valdez continued to say that the journalists in Mexico were organized into organic crime, the middle-aged public officials, and a non-governmental community.
In the last book called "Narko-gazecence", journalists wrote that they were killed not only by drug gangs but by the command of policemen and organization crime.
The media monitor team Articulo 19 was tied to the police and official officers of the Soviet Union last year.
Ramirez said, "You die in Mexico because they want to silence you."
The murders were clearly a cold shower.
No one remembers the death of Maria Elizabeth Macias in Tamaullipa six years ago.
The body was found with a note written by Zetass card: "I'm here because of my feet."
It's a computer keyboard and ear and ear, it's a serial with a broken head.
He chose to cover some of the books such as El Norte, such as the North border state in Chihuahuaa, after the reporter of Miroslava Brarch's death in March.
After the principals were killed in 2004, the rest of El Manana continues, just as El Manana did.
In 2010, Diari de Cuudad Juarez called the drug cartels on the front page, saying, "What do you want?"
Some journalists have fled their own state, even from the country.
It's a quick decision.
It's hard to find work in your field, and they still spread the streets waiting for danger.
Sometimes, three months after he fled Veracuz, he and four women in 2015, and the photographer Ruben Espinza, joined in an apartment in Mexico City.
It's a dance every day for those who stay behind and continue to work.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, says he was afraid to let him know about his drug deal.
He says, "I'm going to hell and I'm a reporter."
On a recently Saturday night, while the last number was ready to finish, Riodoce writes records were sitting outside the office and playing the beer, at the same time.
A series of armed conflicts, which included cancer attacks and security forces in the area, led to the death of 19.
Just as a series of cartels were promised in his message, the war continued.
Their cell phones were placed on Riodoce's web site.
The front page was going to be changed the next day.
The sirens are nearly out there, and there's another weapon around.
Bojorquez looked forward to seeing if they were building the police officers.
They wouldn't show it if they were scared.
Under the retailer of the papers, his middle finger was sent to see all the Sinaloa, and Riodoce's paper was following his feet.
"How can you think of the ship," said Bojorquez, "when I want me to send him outside to tell me that when Javier was killed, I'd be sent out on the street?"
He used publicized to escape from his enemies.
It looks like a mirror in the first look, but it's a terrible one.
The researchers now explained that the first findings of an amazing creation of an incredible creature from a Canadian mined have been preserved very well and that experts have identified it as “the Mona Lisa of experts. ”
It was so well protected that they could understand that the redness of the money skin is brown and they could say it was a 'sorry history.'
The report in the Current Biology magazine described it as one of the best trained dinosaurs and one of the best dinosaurs in the world.
Fossil was about 110 million years ago, from the middle of the Krease return.
So he turned his attention towards the field of embassy.
The plant's armor is the most popular phosphorylation in the National Geographic report.
On 21 March 2011, Shawn discovered the Suncor Millenium Madeni near the North Alberta Canada near Fort McMurray.
He hit something strange and decided to look closer.
The phosil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
The following six years, approximately 2500 pounds (100 kg) of earth’s wild animal appeared.
After all this hard work, the results are ready to show up.
"If you have your eyes short, you can't sleep."
One of the most beautiful and most well-known dinosaurs in the history of science will pass on as Mona Lisa.
Researchers found that the plant would face a serious threat against dinosaurs, even if it was covered with skin, and as much as a tank, and like a walking tank.
He used the red and white crowds to hide from the most heavy dinosaurs, and was known as a contra-gressive technique that many of our animals use today.
By preventing them from hunting by larger dinosaurs, they say that it makes it easier for them to get around and break their enemies.
For the first time, the creature from 110 million-year-old Nodozor family was in May, and it's now popular at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
The researchers have completed their work now, and the museum that spent more than 70,000 hours of time in order to find it was called Mark Mitchell.
It was an extraordinary protection to Dr. Mitchell and international science team of people, including money, and documenting the armor on the body.
They discovered the concentration shadow that means that the top part of the creature is cortexed by the substrate.
Even though the concentration is burning, the findings are a surprise because the concentration of Borealopelta's size is too high today.
This means that the dinosaur is able to see enough pressure by meat dinosaurs, and that evolution is willing to face as a way to survive.
However, the most rare animals used for the concentrational shade (for example, grates, zebras or arandillo) are more likely to be a hunting, which means a serious challenge to survival.
Brown said, "Devasa, a powerful hunter who applies to a hard-sized animal, shows how dangerous the dinosaurrs in Krease can be."
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their currency has also revealed that the skin of dinosaur is red brown.
In order to find out what scientists eat in the last meal, they continue to examine the animal for their silks about life.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, he fell into a deep sea, and there's a back ocean surface.
At that time, Alberta was as hot as the South Florida was today, and probably the rivers and oceans were probably spread in more than they were now.
"Nodozor is completely guarded and protected by the original form of an animal."
'Sorry, as soon as the animal appears in Kretase, it seems to be the same today.'
You don't need too much imagination to build it; if you have short eyes, you can believe it almost sleep.
Cretace was when the giant teriopods, with two feet on the foot, were on the ground.
Despite the king of all the kings, Tyrannosaurus rex lived for millions of years from a trained dinosaur, who could have been hunting by a band of their pets.
There's a 30 ft (11.5mm), a monster with six tons of a monster.
The latest findings in Currenette Biology believe that the scientists who are located in the fields of Borealopelta's death and that it's brought to the sea after death.
The wound was discovered by Shawn Funk on 21 March 2011 by the North Alberta Canada near Fort McMurray.
According to the museum, the most popular armored dinosaur is this and the rest of the bourgeois.
It's about 18 ft [1300 kg] in the middle of the wound.
There's a 2-digit length of 20 inch from your shoulders.
Researchers believe that this armored plant is now on the coast of Western Canada until it is exposed by a river.
But the dinosaur's underside was responsible for his perfect description of his armor.
The phosphorylation of this special type is so well protected that the skin pieces are still covered by the dinosaur's head.
As Michael Greshko wrote for the National Geographic, it's as easy as to make a "pneak" event.
The more I look at him, the more amazing.
The phosphorylated skin pieces still cover all the full-sized armor tables on the dinosaur's head.
The right leg is standing right behind her, five fingeres on the top.
I can count the money on your foot plate."
Don't be your teeth when you say I'm clean.
The dream of every human being with a white teeth and an estic smile.
As people apply their teeth to white roads, the President of the Oral Lazer warns the President of the Ministry Berk, the Center or the Internet, that people should stay away from products that are sold on the Internet.
He said that this kind of substances were drawn to the neck surface, and that the teeth would never be turned again, and he said, "The whiteness of teeth can be used by chemical substances used by the bones, or by the body's body."
Berk, who shares this information with the fact that the health of teeth keeps many health problems, preventing physical and mental health and well - being, and giving a beautiful smile, says:
As long as there is no bone structure or genetic factors, the teeth are usually white.
In the years, it takes more color for medicinal color than I've ever had to draw up, bottles, cigarettes, or dark drinks.
The whiteness of teeth, the chemicals used by teeth, or teeth, can be made with a thin porcelain that is used to be used in the face of chemical substances or teeth.
It's never supposed to be white with products sold at the market or online.
Because these substances draw the neck face, and the teeth are colored so that there will never be a return.
The House of Representatives, 2011, offers elderly, disabled, and alien citizens "Evde Divination and Agricultural Health."
"It's been the service of the Kükeren, a 24-year-old in the U.S.A. in the wake of a 24-year-old-year-old-old-old-year-old-old-old-year-old-old-old-year-old-old-year-old-old-year-old-old-aged-year-old-old-old-year-old-old-old-aged-year-year-old-old-old-old-old-old-old-year-old-year-old-old-old-year-old-old-year-old-old-old-old-old-old-old-old-old-old-old-agedour-aged.
We called the mayor, they came in.
He said, "I don't care if it's because of my neck, if it's nothing of this service, I don't care about my teeth."
A 95-year-old daughter of Günzar Taschiou, who lives in Punar Hall, says, "My mother lives in bed because of 7.5 years of age."
When I arrived in the city, I saw the benefits of this service and I called right away.
We've been taking this service for four years.
I have a problem with my teeth, and they're looking at me when the doctors come.
He used his words to say, "We're very pleased."
No health care has been provided for a full - time minister.
"My brother" in Turkish army.
My dear students have been very interested in the fact that the High Assembly, the former day, was particularly interested in the openings of the Navy of the Sea Forces.
It's not a revolutionary, it's a revolutionary.
There's no such thing as we've never seen before.
So how did this happen?
The commander of the Government was full of the Orramiral Bluent Bostanogus period, and he'd be retired...
And it happened.
Now the order of command came to the Veysel House, the only one that was elected.
In the past, it was supposed to be Commanded by Veysel Pashas for a while.
But the government didn't want him.
I'm trying to tell you a lot, if we start at the top of the sea Forces, the Commands of 1, 3, 4, and 5.
In this case, there was only one revolution in the Navy.
The divorce was supposed to be brought to him: the Donanman Commander in Number Two, Orramal Veysel.
And then what happened?
Coraimal Adnan was appointed by the government in the sixth century.
Now look at the painting!
Orermiral Veysel is staying there, but instead he's called a six-century commander!
He's being put in command of a senior, a prisoner.
I wonder what happens after this?
An independent king who is superior to himself cannot serve the command of a general who has no authority from him.
He can't take orders from him, he can't.
In this case, Veysel shall not be brought to this hurt situation, if it's not loving to the retired, he's going to quit today or tomorrow.
This is the message he has been given by the government, saying, " laugh!"
Last afternoon I wrote this book, it was announced that it was released at hours, but it wasn't clear yet.
Now let's go back to what happened!
The government did not oppose the Veysel House for this reason, for that reason, he was forced to quit, and he was forced to take the command and put the command in his place 6th of our army to make sense of "My brother."
There's also political in it, and we don't know the back of the curtain.
Maybe if someone tells you soon, we'll all learn!
My dear readers, I've tried to tell you a little bit too soon, especially my aunt in the Turkish army.
Not just the rank.
For example, the officer who finished the Harp School at 10.
It's more than just the first order in general.
We lived in the Islamic Harb of this village's story.
Immet Pasha...
There's two army in charge.
Army and 2. Army.
By 1922, our army will be defeated and attacked the Greek army.
In this case, there are valuable names that are expected to be assigned to the military command.
Someone's Repet (Bele) Pasha.
He's offering himself an army command, but he says, "The enemy is innocent of me, and I can't enter his command."
Another name is Jacob Shawki, Pasha.
Master of Atattürk's Harp Academy...
He loved it so much that he called it "Hoom" and he was a valuable and trustworthy commander in various wars.
In 1919, soldiers and civilian Turkish lights were captured and moved to Malta by the British.
And when he returns in exile, he says the command of the army, "The chief of the army says, I can't get orders from him."
However, the Ataturk is very grateful to him, and Jacob accepts the command of one of our two armies.
Third is a very coloring name...
>>uzb_Latn<< Ali Ehsan (Sabis) Pasha.
It's a soldier who's talking too much.
Iraq, Kafkas, Iran, and various battles.
He's been exiled to Malta by the British, and he's going from there to Anukara from the north to the north.
And when he offered himself an army command, the same thing was said, "I can't fight in the command of Ishme without me."
But it's convinced...
But let's see, after the mission, the chief of the Garp Cephs, who has entered his command, is constantly arguing with the chief of Mysmet Pasha, and the army is being disturbed...
And he's been taken away from the big crown shortly before his appointment, and he's being taken to retired, instead of being taken by the remaining Nurettin Pashas.
And then Ali is never corrected with Attürk of the bass.
In Turkish army, my parents' problems are not only in war, but in peace.
Of course he has to leave.
This is the last example of the Vyselse.
How did an active officer get to know the answer of the question?
>>uzb_Latn<< On August 9, 2014, Britttany Ferrell fell from the skin.
One day after she arrived in New York City, St. Louis's local sister sat in her bed and started walking on Facebook.
It's exactly about sharing someone from high school.
"Polis just killed a 18-year-old boy and he's still sleeping on the street."
When he found out that no one else shared this information in the inside, he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user named TheeParoah continued to be retrained in her internal flow.
He was killed in Fergon Missouri by a white police officer from St. Louis region, Michael Brown, who was 18 years old, without armed police.
He shared a photo of Brown's serial lifeless body on the street.
Ferrell thought to himself, "This is wild."
But death wasn't a new thing for him or his people.
He left his phone back to Tweets about the people's finding at Canfield Drive next night.
There were pictures of a man who wrote a phantom who said he was policemen and Brown's father, "Fergon police just killed my son!"
A police officer was watching a live video with a dog standing in front of a group of protesters.
Another cop in another video says he set up the trigger of the rifle and shouted, "I'll kill all of you... animals."
Ferrell reminded me he said, "It's not used."
"It's not a murder that we're used to.
I felt a surprise at that time.
I was mad and I was crying."
He split up a back ticket and went home the next day.
She took her six-year-old daughter from her father's house the next morning and decided to go with him.
He'll come to Ferrell and Fergon to the next three documents, on August 11, about a new documentary.
It's a story of the people who are looking for answers to the answers that they are looking for in those people who are living in and out of the way of life and prostate, love and loss, strength, and opposition.
When Ferrell was wearing a flower dress and a suitable suit, he and his wife, Fergon, went back to speak about "the experience of political experiences and political events" that occurred earlier that morning.
"Do you remember when I taught you that black people should fight for their faith?"
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and it wasn't true.
I couldn't take it." Ferrell later.
"It's the result of what happened in the past today.
He needs to know that, he must see and grow up in it.
Only in the field of activeism and organization should we also be able to make sure that the political experience and political status and freedom and freedom are free, and we need to know what to do to free ourselves.
If I'm lucky to give him a chance to experience an intuitive experience that can't make his rude behavior personal, no black woman would be a difference from the white woman.
I shall protect him from the evil of his deeds.
At Fergon's arrival, the first stop was to talk to the police center and the officer Darren Wilson who was waiting for him to talk about a matter that was not committed later, and then turned into a Soviet camp for the activists.
There, Ferrell and her daughter were connected to local workers who were preparing for food.
They made the bags and helped to transfer them to the Protestants.
For Ferrell, a slow new actin's stroke.
While a student at the University of Missouri, district students were President of the State, and in a political community, he said, "The justice of food and injustice was completely completely completely transformed from 9 August to August."
"I didn't have any experience to try.
He came from his own self."
Over weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaa Fogan, one of the authors of the film at the show.
Fogan said he and his own image manager Lucas Alvavado-Farrr said he wanted to "be able to make it."
Ferrell came up with a question: "Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story you can use?"
This suspicion was generally reported to be a white man, and a crowd of people came from his suffering and death...
"We heard people who were born in Ferguson, and we decided to do something different."
Fogan has already made contact with the former artist, Damon Davis, who is known for the act of death.
His participation warmed Ferrell to the project, followed by "Who's?" in the years following Brown's shooting.
David said: "It's not a documentary, someone's speech or talk to us; we're speaking."
"That's what's given to me, because it's how these people will be represented."
"Even though it wasn't focused on Ferrell's experiences, it proved that the movement was the most obvious of the film players that the action was not about a leader, that the community was coming together.
As a result, "Who's who?" In remarkable terms, in love, and with his wife, Ferrell's personal choices.
Ferrell, who smiles at his first appearance, said, "I feel naked."
"When I was doing this and people of black people, I realized that there would be a lot of damage.
And Ferrell's story is that black gay women's role in the Black Lives Matter movement, and he's putting it back in the center.
The movement is defined by two of the world leaders from the world's social media teams from the political group of black young Tralvon Martin's death in 2012.
"The political gay women in the leadership were mostly held on their feet," said Ferrell, "and it's from us that we are still in war in many fronts.
Black gay women have to carry all this weight."
"Heyket is really held by black women and many gay women."
Still, Ferrell insists that it's not about "this thing" and when it's not selected for his identity.
He said, "The one who was moving this energy."
"It's not his fault in front of her, because as a black gay woman, you're going to lose a lot of life in these conflicts.
You can feel his energy from the screen."
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson are already gone, but there are concerns about the police.
Ferrell is under trial for two more years in order to close the highway during a show.
The socio-political atmosphere in the area of my house is described as "carma".
Still, Fergon keeps a song in his memory about three years ago.
"It's our duty to fight for our ambition.
It's our duty to win.
We need to love each other and support them.
We have nothing but to lose.
Kirie Irving: Earth isn't around!
Irving, who's talking to NBC Sports, is "not around the world."
Earth is straight.
That's what they're getting people to fear.
Oh, man, don't question too much.
Because the more you figure out the more information, the more it comes up with a lot of information.
That's crazy.
Is the world straight?
Or is she going around around around around her own place?
I think you should take a look at this.
I'm telling you, they're lying against our face.
They're lying to us!
Irving said, "I believed I've believed I've believed I've believed I've believed in all the years."
I thought the world was around.
You really think we're back in the solar system?
Nothing they sent is coming back.
He's not coming back!
The information they gave us is too tight.
The truth is here.
You just need to call this truth.
"Do you understand what I'm saying?"
Kirie Irving, who claims that the world is right, is fighting 244 and 5.9 asist partners.
>>uzb_Latn<< Assessment: artist, Chelsea Mannning used to create DNA
In the middle of the room in New York Fridman Gallery, there are hundreds of white, black, brown, and brown, almost almost identical to each other.
It was created by 30 portrait artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, who was sent by Chelsea Manng.
It was discovered that after the secret diplomatic messages were leaked to the WikiLeaks website, the former intelligence analyst Manning for 35 years sent his cut hair from Fort Leavenworth prison.
The name of the new exhibit on August 2.
This is one of the two-year-old novels that unites his research in technology, computer sciences, and articulated by Dewey-Hagborg, the third day's execution of the task with Barack Obama, and a two-year-old writer of Man's first event.
Using the DNA algorithm and using this gene to describe what a person might look like, Dewey-Hagorg, a 30-digit person who has this gene, has also found that the function of DNA (and not just a few other ways) of experimenting with his own experiment, but also a little bit of brainstorming.
Bradley Edward was born as Edward, but he was clearly considered to be a woman, six of the Casusan Law, a computer fraud, and a crime in 2013.
The agent was taken under pressure by prison, so there was only one photo of Mann's driver seat, who was sitting in the driver's driving seat with him, a black ring.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was able to achieve the success of the project further Garip ahead of the decrements.
In this case, the artist produced the DNA from which these people could look like.
At this time, he received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They were interviewing with Chelsea Manng in prison, and they wanted some portraits that could accompany this book," Dewey-Hagorg explained.
The visit was not being reported at this time, so they reached Chelsea, and they asked if there was no interest in the transfer of a DNA port.
The artist and his prison inspiration, in two years, came to have been an unexpected letter of encouragement by making a change in two years.
They even discovered the Baskets, who had been promoted by Shoili Lawgo, who forgave Chelsea's punishment, and had a future in which he could personally view it as a cardiac book.
A few days after Obama's arrival for the book market, Mann's desire for the trade was a happy experience in Kansas after seven bitter years in a military prison.
Donald Trump has a deep and powerful point in the new, terrestrial pathways that promote information about the government and transeconscience of the government.
When it was asked for weird timing, Dewey-Hagborg said, "The events are due to one reason."
An artist's signature on the wall of his Gas is that Mann's character in large sizes is placed under the heart of the character (the character of "i" in the case of the character was put in the heart), which was called for "tomatography, sex, and culture to end.
There's a mitochondrial DNA store across the wall: there are many C's, G's, and A's.
The 200 letters (also known as the word of sociology) include nucleotides, Dewey Hagorg wanted to tell us how much we all look like us as a biological creation.
"What I'm hoping people can get it out of this is that they don't care who we are and how clear our genome is, how clear it is, how clear it is that the video deals with the Taxi-Hagborgies," he said in 2007.
"DNA data can tell a lot of different stories, and that's 30 of these stories."
The last piece that was held in one room was a short line from the short line earlier.
It's shown here by Manning, King Kong style, the United States of Disabilities from the Disabilities of Disabilities.
"They've made your conversation if they've won."
"Don't be silenced with the family."
The artist from Philadelphia said, "This is a letter from a letter he wrote to me."
"When I talk about this, my teeth fall down."
Man has not yet seen the exhibition of his own genetics, but when he sees that he's already in the middle of the book, he will be greeted by his own genetic pronouns, like a group of protists.
Like everything else in the series, genetic pills were made by Mann's neck (52, Man's height), which was especially designed.
Regarding Dewey-Hagborg, he said, "I'd put them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd."
"I wanted this to be taken as if it was a public move that was made with Chelsea, as behind her freedom."
Northwestern education staff and the University of Oxford is searching for the murder
The police said that after the death of a person in a high office in Chicago, Northwestern University of Education and the University of Oxford, a man was born in a country for working at the University of Oxford.
Cook Management Records on Monday, following the claim that Trentton H. James Cornell-Duranleau was taken to the first arrests for the murder of Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56).
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau died many times after he died.
In a report published by the Chicago Police Department, we were told that a body was found on July 27th.
The officers got a phone, came to Grand Plaza Apartments, and found the victim with a lot of depth in his body.
The official sources said Cornell-Duranleau was dead at the scene and the police were looking for a murder as a murder.
Lathem has been doing accrediting since 2007 at Northwestern University in microbiology and immunology.
Alan K. Cubbage, president of college relations, said that Lathem was permitted to enter the University of Northwestern University campus.
"It's a crisis case and Northwestern University of Northwestern, which is under investigation."
Warren is a senior salary assistant at Oxford University.
"We're in touch with the United Kingdom police and are willing to help the U.S. investigational authorities," he said.
In the brain, Warren's colleagues were also told that they were in shock and wanted to be delivered.
U.S. President Anthony Gugliemi said that the suspects have been encouraged to surrender to the Ottodes.
"Polisin has a idea where they are, but our efforts to identify him are slow."
Gglimi said the local, regional, and international osteoporosis helped to find the suspects.
Gugliemi said he got a phone call from the Grand Plaza building director, who had just gotten something to build up in 1008.
The police showed the scene as a terrible threat.
The Giglimium said it wasn't clear about whether it was on July 27th.
He said Lathem and Warren were true when they were in the building.
"We believe that the victim was associated with Latham, the president of the dead."
"Polis still works the time and history of the victim and probably a family, for a particular family event," said a government officer in Grand Plaza.
Italy put hands on the German ship
Italian police revealed that Iuventta was a ship in search of refuges in the middle of the Mediterranean, last night, at Lampedua Island.
The police who reported that two members of the body were involved in their telephone talks with the journalists, heard that this operation was carried out on the investigation that began in October 2016.
"Libya-Italia is also an act of illegal transfer activities," Jugend Retett's members, at least three times, are taking advantage of the shelters they receive from foreign merchants.
Jugend Retett, who was questioned by the prosecutor, is also among the claim that members of members of the League have been working with some people from the Ministry of Justice.
Thus, according to the organization, the preliminary laws indicated that human life would continue to be saved, and that the charges against them would be considered to be punished.
In addition to the ships of Italy Security and the European Union of Europe, nearly 9 international districts have been assigned to search for shelters in Akdeniz.
The Italian government has set up 13 financial standards for these institutions to follow, and he ran it out.

>>uzb_Latn<< Russian Prime Minister Mutko: "We will complete the WADA road map"
Russian Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko, Russia Anti-Dopping Agency (RUSADA) said that the rest of the world will not take long time to apply the criteria of the Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
"It has been completed in a set of map criteria, the RUSADA has agreed to cooperate with the United Kingdom Anti-Discing.
The WADA road map was updated on this link."
The Prime Minister recently described the second part of the WADA Board of Education, which describes RUSADA's recent development of RUSADA.
According to Mutko, that doesn't mean anything to worry about Russia.
"It was announced, and it was all done.
He added that the results would be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and to WADA soon."
There's a criteria mentioned in the list that the Russian anti-doping authorities approved by the WADA, a Canadian lawyer, Richard McLaren, who claims to have been approved by the Russian prosecutor of the Russian sport.
"When our anti-dorpping system accepts a failure, we're trying to question the investigation.
All checks have been done.
But there is no government program, and we will not accept anything.
Mutko's words were repeated by the president of the Russian Public Anti-Doping Committee Vitaly Smirnov.
Smirnov, who spoke in the early hours of the day at RSport, agreed on their past problems in Russia's anti-doping organs, but he added, "We've done a lot of opportunities to create and organize.
"No one thought to accept the report as unsatisfactory," he added, Smirnov.
RUSADA was arrested by WADA in Russia during the next summer of November 2005.
With the eyes of international experts and the United Kingdom Anti-Dopping, this memory was permitted to test and coordinator.
In July, after a visit to the General Center in Moscow, WADA announced the WADA Director Ovier Niggli RUSADA has made it clear that RUSAA has moved on.

The president of Galataray will not be left empty
Galalasaray former president Faruk Sürren, who went to Bushresh and the president of the United States and the president for the Nidian transfer to Ankara.
Here's the personal explanation that the chief of the president's SKAH readings:
"We're finished when we're going."
The president of Galataray doesn't leave the president, his hand will be empty.
Ndiaye transfer: Galasaray won't go to football.
The football player comes to President's feet.
Of course they know, they want to kiss your hand...
But no matter who's the player, the president won't go to his feet.
You're giving 9 million Euros to the player Ottomanspor who bought 300 thousand Euros...
Not 7.5 million million, he's gonna be 9 million!
You already have a big investment, of course, you'll play 7.5.
I don't want to be Tenky.
But it's in the middle.
G.S.S.'s going on the erosion.
Not just football, it's all wrong.
And the Qur'an which is the Qur'an and the Qur'an that will change it.
But as far as I understand, members are happy!
The start-ups to help your company not to be next Uber.
Amy Errett wanted to measure the happiness of working in the e-commerce-up, but the customers didn't work.
The answers were usually unproductive, unable to help or worse.
Even if he'd had an anonymity, some workers weren't counting on him for years.
Errett, a 75-year-old e-commerce company in San Francisco, says, "No time or object has been held."
He called out someone outside for help.
A new kind of human resource is coming to understand how the companies feel.
These are some of the ways that the syphilis perform this to measure the activity of employees and to ensure that firms and demographic teams are targeted by special teams, and in some cases, the executive executives who are willing to pay taxes to the staff, and in some cases allow the manager to pay taxes.
The software analysis engines analyzed Redwood City-up's co-founding partner and President Jim Barnett, and President Jim Barnett, who observed your company's health, but said, "Where's your company's Fitbit?"
Errett says that his colleagues used to think and feel better after three years.
With the symphistication of the teams present, the company receives the most complaints of which parts of the company have received, and which manager has shown that there are low-level points of interest, so that they can be set up for these reasons.
To not be a next Uber, companies begin to understand that they should have knowledge of the culture of their employees; Uber has been in a scandal since an old employee's published a blog that clearly portrays what those who say are being punished.
For the start-ups like Glint, this vision means a very complicated job opportunity.
Online technology technologies can be estimated at 118,7 billion dollars by 2020, according to Lt's Talk Payments.
The interest in and activity that helped the companies identify bad behaviors and prevent obstacles has been increased by Uber's discussion of Uber's lack of independence in this year.
Converncies have 600 clients, including Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a client.
Like Grint, Convergent allows companies to make private "nails", real-time confidential reports, and take their map of problems.
It also offers an anonymous letter of help that the workers can deliver their bad behavior.
If the president is charged, the complaints are going to the director.
He said, "Caucomo Courts of the Corvercen and President Patrick Quinlan."
Quinlan said, if a company doesn't treat their employees badly, or does not act ethically, the editors may be able to deal with financial problems, even if they don't come into the field.
The restaurant chain of over 2,500 employees, Ruby Tuesday, is using more than one year to ensure that the workers are aware of the basics and procedures of the Converns and the way to get to the company center easily.
When an employee asked me to report a problem, he had to find a phone number or e-mail in the company center, he was on a official complaint, and he was hoping to take serious action.
Ruby Tuesday's high court officer James Vitrano said that it's not a good way to follow the complaints that most of them are dangerous and disturbing.
But with the use of the company's Convercent now, the problems (such as office, city, state, or state) can be resolved faster and solved.
Vitrano, director of Ruby Tuesday's risk management group, said, "I can get closer to a full, 360 degree perspective."
"In fact, we protect our feelings against legal cases."
After the failure of the economic values from Arthur Andersen's Enron scandal in 2002, companies have taken on economics, values, and relationships with employees, said Quinlan.
But after the "sosocial media came to its own, the firms realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from becoming viral.
He said, "Before the use of technology to test what he was doing, people used as a form of strategy," he said.
Glint and Convercent are also offering their services as a service, and they receive payment for the use of their products.
It's a business model and opportunity that supports both start-ups.
Convercen, Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capittal took $10 million of financing from firms and dropped the total market market at $47 million.
Grint gave me $10 million from Besseer Venture Partners, and he took the total funding to $60 million.
These investors are not so surprise when companies take care of each other's nature, culture, and risk rates.
Artan's fewer studies show that today's employees look forward to more things than they used to do before.
Like Silicon Valley, high payoffs and interesting projects are only needed.
They want to make sure they're accepted, paid, and pay their time to a company with a positive amount of time.
"When people feel happy to be part of a company and appreciate what they have done, they feel better about the company."
In investors do their own portfy companies well when they do well, they get a good job if the companies feel inside, and the company feels safe.
If third party analysis tools are promised to increase the internalness of workers and their own feelings, it's not surprising that they can find support.
It is important to have data related to the workforce, according to the cultural experts.
But the data doesn't work if the company's responsible for the movement.
In fact, if a company wants to get back to his employees, he can expect a change.
And if it doesn't come fast enough, or if it doesn't, it can cause disappointment and feel like the workers are broken.
Russell Rath, who is a consultant in Cotter International, who has made a lot of trust in firms, and has made a lot of trust in firms, said, "You're going to have to be ready to give 4,000 talks."
"Because if you don't follow it, people will think like this, "Have you really heard me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why would I care?"
According to Errerett, a problem was reported at Madison Reed, the same day when a problem was reported in the Grint.
And after the decision-making mechanism and communication quality of communication, the company has added communication training in order to solve problems.
In Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new instincts about its employees, and the long term time, he hopes he will be able to hold more workers in this industry.
"If you don't depend on creating a transparent culture, you'll lose people."
"And if you lose people, you'll lose customers.
And when you lose the customers, you will lose the firms."
It's a long day for the NCAA to keep two practices every day.
It's at 11:00, and they're hanging around to talk about a new anti-technical stage of the UCLA football players in the camp.
Some have grown up in their form, have been driven from the opposite side of the first day in education camp.
For some important part of the team, these empty minutes are creating a day-to-day break.
After 3 hours of training, registered players will return to their classrooms, and the next day, they will try their final exams before they return to the Wasserman Football Center.
Just before Jim Mora arrived on Monday, he said, "Now, three days ago, there's a pity for these men."
The NCAA's two training days, at least until the finals end of Friday.
That's why UCLA's first three programmes were scheduled to start at 7.15 for the players' training program.
Another practice that doesn't have two practices a day; Bruins is getting closer to one week, and during the summer of the summer, Mora's six season at Westwood's Westwood.
In September 20th, Texas planned to take 18 trainings from the 20th to August, before they started the official game for A&M against A&M.
Mora said that even though the players added new pencils to their busy study program, NCAA has supported the rule change.
"We carry a huge burden on them for three or four days, and that's very hard."
And they've been doing it recently, and they work, great kids.
I think we'll have more time when we're on Saturday. It'll be great."
The UCLA will stop their practices when the camp is over; the ball that is close to the open and end of the camp will be closed, and it's not easy to think that it's a safe hotel with a guard behind a pendant.
The hotel of Bruins is planned to be located at the hotel from the beginning of this week, but Mora accepts that these rooms would be free during the season.
She said, "We're going to have confidence."
"It's a real concern, and it's not too easy to think that someone's going to rent a room and take a practice there and take a video.
If there's a video record of an experiment, it's a good thing.
But we'll be safe there, and we'll have security up there at 8:00.
We're going to do the best we have.
I won't worry too much about that.
We have a plan."
Facebook builds a storytelling power to fight against false news
Facebook's third party will send more potential fake articles to the audience, and will show them their findings under the original sharing; the world's largest social network, trying to fight with the news on Tuesday.
He said that he would be able to identify possible fake fakes and use updated machine learning in order to send stories to the stories, and that would be under the original article to confirm the results of the story.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distributed areas of news that many know the United States presidential election of 2016.
The problem was that the French voters were forced to stop false news in the summer before the presidential election and supporting Germany's political media network efforts to speed up violence in Europe.
On Thursday, Facebook said that a test of new storytelling was beginning in the United States, France, Holland, and Germany.
"In addition to seeing what stories were discussed by the third party storytellers, people would like to have more information about what they read and share."
Facebook said that Facebook will continue to test the "good article" feature and that he will work on other changes in the news to reduce false news.
The story of a Kale in England.
In the past, a small Scottney Castle, a Squeeze music club, took a shelter in the 1970s and 1980s for Margaret Thitcher.
But right now, in a history document, a line written by Jamie Rhodes, who was inspired by a line from the Bewl River Valley, in Kent, witnessed the peace conditions of the Bewl River Valley.
"I've found it nice to look at someone who died 300 years ago."
"How personal ties are to hold this letter on my hand."
A Kale, a different artist from the Middle East, who lives in Scotland, was married by a different artist from the United Kingdom (Isaac Lenwicz, Brian May Smith, William Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg).
It's not the first book that corresponds to this archive: he also wrote the stories of the British Library, a project in which he found emotional feelings.
"I've got the prints on the side of a letter written by a double agent who works for the Corresponders," he says.
"It was his head finger!
And the letters always smell because you burned a fire for the light.
That smells like he's there for another 300 years.
Oh, I love the archives!"
As one of the old papers in love, I've been able to get support from the National Trust and the British Art Council and stay in the castle for nearly four months ("If I have to be honest, I have a little bit more than I'm willing to be honest").
Rhodes spent his days discovering the "new" castle of Victoria's history, searching the archives and searching for their remains, and using many treasures, such as sediments and sediments, such as sediments and sediments, and antiques, which have spent hundreds of years of years in Victoria's history.
He traveled the land and its territory of the former pendant by talking to guardmen, gardeners, and at times working with artists on the beauty of the book of the book.
Then the night was "viski drink and write."
The National Turst was complete, but the last successor Elizabeth Hussey died in 2006 is not known until Scottney's detailed history.
Rhodes began to capture the original archive ten years later, but he described it as "Oh, many years ago, aristocratics say, "Oh, throw it down."
The letters of the days of the British Empire, "You think the boundaries of which you have, you think, are the most boring of the two families," Rhodes said, "There is a tree that has a strong roots on both families."
Forget it, men!
Some of the stories in the collection that have recently been constructed to join the New Testament in 1381, including The Labourer, have been used as a starting point to make a larger entry to the British history of England.
"There's a record that the Queen and Sussex's Chevile families are in the castle for 1380."
"The Great East Asian started in this area, and I thought it might be a good starter.
Maybe these two could be connected?
The Darrell family's story of the story of the seven years in the history of the rest.
Or the 18th century fugitive Arthur Darrell's place was discovered when the Tabut was removed from the ground.
The Darrellss were looking like the Scottney family, and they were always spending money because they couldn't afford it.
In different generations, Darrell decided to marry wealthy women, and I imagine them as a group of handsome men who are willing to build property."
Rhodes, who's done the work at the station, is looking for other single writing experiences.
In Fin's wild life, a field of artorium at the early 20th century, he completed a two-week job for a man who was re-induced by nature.
But Scottney's holding a separate place in his chest.
He says, "I'm sorry I'm being hurt."
"Oh, I have to go now and face the damn real life."
The reaction to the Meral Akkerer's 'Maho'
National Haret Party General Ismet Greatman, recently published a statement regarding the social media and press of the MHP.
Using the expression "P" from the sides of the social media and "the former rifle Marks" to MHP, "the heart of the heart has been applied to games and speeds to prevent the presence of MHP in 12 September.
Bigman, he said:
The "Turk's history of the Turkish people's existence" has become so ugly that there's no doubt that the crime file can't be taken away, the idea of the crime, if it is mixed up your hands."
"Now, the MHP Cocaeli Council has released 410 members and members of its members in the New Bursa City District."
250 percent, with unsatisfactory messages like 300, the public is misdirected.
It has already come upon the news of [the punishment of] falsehood.
As this number has not been given to us, the number of suppliers in the garden does not extend a hand to the banks.
Bigthaman, who mentioned in the phrase "in the word", said he was trying to correct the people's beliefs and practices.
"It's against the propagan and campaigns of the MHP against the MHP" said.
The MHP General General General General of the MHP said that Turkey was an important and independent actor of Turkish:
The former Marxists who wanted to destroy the Turkish conscience of the Turkish people cannot.
All the comments made are a dirty account behind the application algorithm.
Because political and media have kept her eyes on the MHP plate.
It doesn't mean that no good work of our party, no good work and no hard work is being done right now.
What's wrong with those who can't get rid of their negatives?
They didn't touch MHP in their lives, they didn't share our memories, they didn't understand, they didn't come to our fight, they'd always be able to keep their mind off their hearts.
The efforts of the National Guard Party to promote unity and integrity are an effort in the brain.

Washington, Green Card's Changes Rules
According to the media, President Donald Trump said that there will be a new U.S. move plan to change the rules of Green Card.
The legal immigrants are regarded as reducing 500,000 dollars per year for temporary work requirements and restrictions on families.
New rules were offered by the Republicans and supported by the president.
It's going to be discussed on both wings of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise millions of dollars for taxes, and replace it with Green Card to other countries of the United States.
The law will reduce the zinc register and take the place of my current regime.
This new application will benefit those who speak English, its financial resources and their economy, according to Trump's report of the American media.
The writers commented the Fenerbach-Strim Gaz game
Two seasons I couldn't find, I couldn't see it again and again, Kaqua...
It was in the field to make a "mangal heart" agreement between the Bigman's forces.
We can appeal to your game, positions, or performances, but I haven't seen a game that's been working on such a long time.
He was in the first game, but yesterday he's got his wallets on his shoulder; the commander of the Fenerbula's field is now Valbuena.
It was an age of age, but in Bigman's words, Bigman had a character.
30 years ago, we gave Riza the name for the atomic car.
If it's done, it'll be the best for the French player.
She's all over the place of Sahan, joined all the post entities, took responsibility, and burned a huge show to her neck by throwing a ball.
Alper's first play in front of his second-life position left Stram Gaz in the field for a long time.
While the fenerbal circuit was running away, he was always looking for an formula to get over a hard wall like that.
They're in charge of the field, but they can't produce a positive post in a drug-producing field.
This image may have a comment, but we're dealing with a game that refuses to send Ahmethan to his post.
What if the team didn't trust the young player or the performance has to make a little more progress.
They couldn't use two clear opportunities after scor 1-1.
It was important that they go through the tunnel, but it would make the night more beautiful to stand up to the player's fight.
It'll probably be 1-2 new transfer until Monday.
But the truth is that Fenerbache needs the largest number 12...
We're on the side of a very bright and delicious season, who's trying to play ahead.
Aquaku Bigman's machine builds a bit more time.
They're fine physically.
The game key will come.
You see that all the footballers in the field are getting more self-explanatory.
For a new page, they need a lot of opportunities last night.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we need to worry.
As you think you can't be more weird, 2017 is a new report on the technology development of the sex robot.
Yeah.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
In the past, the question has been published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five months.
We need to take their load to Noel Eastkey, the headmaster of the robot science and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University.
The clients can choose the color of the robot, the meme light shape, and the skin type.
Mr. Sharkey said, "People laugh at them, but firms really love them, and we'll see them more."
Modern sex babies have a hot silicon that is hot to touch the silicons, especially with human intelligence.
Users can also make personal decisions by choosing the robot's eye color, the shape of a
But it's even more interesting, since there are many robotics who have the "consequences" to demonstrate their articulation.
Modern sex babies are born into silicon-sized robots.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to get their own robotics attracted by character characteristics (e.g. shyness).
Later, there's the Roxy Gold sex robots, which are developed by the True Companion, the pre-dicate program, which includes the "Wheezy Farrah" and "maceric" personality.
"Roxy Gold has a person who wakes up as long as you can."
I mean, whatever you love her, she doesn't love her whatever you like.
They also have spirits in the day like the real people.
She can be sleepful, wishing to talk, or she can be in "attack".
There are many disturbing sides of the rise of sex robots: not only take the place of real human relationships but also the characteristics of obedient women, as we approach Frijit Farah.
The Web site describes True Companion, Roxxxy, but it's for men.
"If a woman can't have a vibrator like this, why don't men have Roxxy?
What's wrong with this sex robots isn't just a fireball or sex toys.
Their growth and increased complexity indicates the dark and deepness of our culture, and don't come back to the desire of sex with a propulsion of sexual equality.
Many men are born naturally not having sex robots, and the FRR takes care of their growing potential, but they are now located in the outermost culture of the tobacco culture.
But those flying planes can be highly educated about how we're living.
A lot of people are not strange or aggressive until the free market has given them the right to be like that.
It's not a time when sex robots are in danger of women's sexual assault on women in the White House.
The Handmaid's TV series is the most stunning side of the image, not of scientific bodies or objects that reveal all details, but of how real the image feels.
It's a sudden change of Gilead Republic, but it doesn't seem like much change now.
The goal of these sex robots is to create more physical compared to real women (at the time of the porn stars) as long as they can be available to the rest of these sex robots.
They want their Creator to give them a sense of touch, and they want a real body to observe their actions.
But when the job comes to them, robots can't represent real women.
They can't leave their wives or leave them.
There's no activity or history of history, there's nothing to reveal independence, or nothing to break up total slave fantasy.
In other words, they're slaves who enjoy them.
Or by the date of 2017, women.
The American military convoy attack: the dead and the wounded...
Afghanistan's capital was targeted by foreign military forces who were targeted by suicide attacking the city of Karababı, in the country.
1 NATO's army and 3 civilians lost their lives, and 5 of the victims in the concentration of American soldiers and the 1st of NATO forces were the interpreters in the concentration of NATO.
The official statement that NATO support forces (Resolute Support) in Afghanistan was issued by NATO forces in the form of an Afghan Ugal Army in the United States, stating that the suicide bomber was inflammatory during the campaign.
The wounded personnel's Bagram Airlines have been taken to the U.S. Department of Justice.
The lives of the wounded are not at stake.
It says suicide bomber is the Taliban.
Trump's big scene?
To show Mit Romney a right-wheel
The fact that political division of the United States voted into the United States voted was the reality of Trump's time.
The papers from Christmas and Thanksgiving in the United States were full of how to deal with the family of relatives who had voted for Trump.
We're all going to try to blow our own fleets.
A little less talking, Trump's power to bring families together.
I'm sure it's because my left-handed poet, who lives in Chicago, is visiting us in New York this week.
He reminded me that there would be a powerful influence against a common enemy.
Everyone, including the Republican brother, who has been associated with the White House for decades, is suddenly and strange.
It's a good thing at the dinner table, but it's just that I think it's a big deal.
Left was invented by Trump, but the power of the president's creation has created the power to direct the right for me.
When we talk about "Normalation" and Trump, one day we talk about the terrible possibility that his behavior could no longer shock her behavior.
There is even a long-lasting script, and Trump looks like "normal" and these look like a mannient symbol.
I find myself living in a nostalgia for the crazy version of Mit Romney.
When Trump goes, the next President must have only in mind that the island of the Republic has a degree of improvement.
We took our children in the town of my cousins at the Central Park, and you need the highest and highest-factors that run by New York Park department, or you need three bucks you could spend in the city.
The horses are usually large, centralized, centralized and centralized by fibiglas design (the pediatric image made of strange images, and the animals are back in fear of their own shoulders) and the music that is inflammatory.
In other words, many cities of one city may be disappointed: high buildings start to become boring, the lung line starts to get to know too much more exciting, and the truth of the city is not reached.
It's been thirty and five years, and I still haven't gone through the day when Swiss Cottage's not actually a Swiss house (not a large bar Olde Swiss Cotttage) in North London.
What's going on in Central Park is still a strange magic experiment, two-year-old men, 11-year-old, and two women can go here and all have a very good time.
If I had a note on the gun, I'd give him a note, but thank you very much.
On the other hand, this week, before I spend my credit card in a bomb this week, I was asked to evaluate between 1 to 5 stars.
The same thing at the coffee shop in my street corner, and one note is a 15 %'s choice to match for a quick purchase.
This effect is not just slowing down a non-profit trade, but also pressure on the server to make a person who doesn't need a person who doesn't need it.
The poor woman in the neck, like an excuse to get married, gave me five stars to give her credit card.
When the heat was about 41 degrees away, they wore their furniture.
In Tunceli, one of my hot days of mine, the people were exposed to Munzur lavas.
At noontime, he tried to protect himself from the heat of the hot temperatures, including the young, old, young, old, women, and boys, on the shores of the Munzur River.
Especially since the Townsian citizens in the country, such as Holland, France, England, and England, have been filled with plajs outside Munzur China, especially because they live in the country of Munzur China.
"I didn't want to spend my vacation in the West for the sake of Munzur Plaj," said Suna Tosun, from Tunli, "I didn't want to spend my vacation in the west, I didn't want to spend my vacation on the family Munzur, and stay in our own land."
"Munzur's freezing water has no place in the world, in these temperatures, Munzur has cooled us."
Hasan Ulu from Germany said they chose the Munzur River in Tunisia instead of the Source or Bodrum Islands, and so they didn't regret it.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital with chest pain
It's the second time that Pistorius has left the prison to visit the hospital.
Last year, after the prison authorities fell in the cell, they were taken to the hospital for treatment of the cuts.
Pistorius was in charge of the murder after the previous accident was decided by the prosecutors.
In the early hours of 2013, he killed Steencampa at the house of Pretoria in Pretoria, and several times he killed a
Pistorius claimed he had mixed up with someone who was in the house hiding in his girlfriend's room without an invitation.
The prosecutors explained that they thought it was too light this time, that Pistorius intended to object again against the six-year torment.
U.S. Congress said he's going to oppose the South African High Court, and the complaint could be considered this year.
Pistorius, if the prosecutors succeed, he'll be able to stand up for 15 years of his punishment.
There's no death penalty in South Africa.
First frame has been successful

Two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece
According to Foreign Business Report and BTV, two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece because they needed to make illegal camp.
A group of illegal camps including the two Bulgarians were arrested by police in Sithionia on August 1st morning.
They were left on the same day as the investigation continues.
He told BTV that Bulgarians were left later on.
Greek occupants have forced their control over free camping, and they are still holding serious punishments for those who have not left for that purpose.
It's gonna be controlled all my time.
The minister said that the court could be punished.
We're not going back to Holland without finding her.
JOEY Hoffman (22) went to Turkey to accompany his two friends at the beginning of the summer.
Joey Hoffman, who went through the car they were renting for Adana and Mersin, disappeared in Silifke on July 8, July.
All his friends came together, but all the calls were reported to his family in Holland, even though they could not reach Hoffman.
While the police moved on to find missing tourism, his brother Robin Hoffman and his friends, Angelo Durei, went to Jay Gawwald Adana.
PROPHECIES IN THE TRUTH
Robin Hoffman, who was in charge of the police, threw missing snakes on Adana and Mersin to find his brother.
We said they heard from Robin Hoffman's brother on the last 8 July, saying, "We've got to the police in Holland."
Then with my two friends, we're here to apply to the police here.
We couldn't find any clue.
"We will stay in Turkey until my brother has heard the news," he said.
Well, the World's Second Cren of the World
The 2017 Paltillian Comet was the second world of the national athlete Ayeren Green Green River, founded in Russia.
Look at youth and Spor Minister Osman love, Aishe Cen Green, who won silver with his message.
On the first day of the 2017 Paleillary Youngs Champion in Russia, Cereen was the second world of 400 meters above the Green Green River.
Ceren took his place in the park with 8 finalists, and he took the gold medals only 27 salads.
The gold medal at 03.8.18.73 per second, while Elena Lopatina won from Russia for about 03.00 degrees.
Turkey represents 8 men and 8 women athletes in the champion.
"I think I'm dying, she's mom."
"I don't want to die, Mom, that's not fair."
"Thank you for everything you've done for me," Italian Gloria Trevisan said.
Among the men who were unable to hear the fire were the 26 - year - old Gloria Trevisan and Italian lover Marco Gotardi, a 26 - year - old girl in the 21st floor of the building.
In the north of Italy, Trevisan family lawyer Maria Crystalna Sandri said that he had lost two young people, according to the information that he had received from the British authorities.
The lawyer who wants young parents to have a lot of pain, asked the journalists to explain it to them.
I think I'm dying, my mom.
The lawyer Sandri said that after Gloria's fire, her mother called the Emanuela Trevisan and heard her last talk, she cried when she heard the last talk that her mother had made.
According to this, Gloria Trevisan spoke with his mother for two hours after the fire that began around 01.00.00.
It's called Trevisan's calmer in their first conversation, "Anne, bad things happen here, fire."
We're stuck, we can't get out.
There's some smoke, but don't worry, we're waiting for rescue.
"We tried to open the door, but there were so many smokes and the elevator wasn't working."
With the rise of fire, the next calls were announced that the last words of Gloria Trevisan were the ones:
Mom, my whole life goes out of front of my eyes.
I think I'm dying.
I had a life I had before, that's not fair.
I don't want to die, and I want to help you as a material.
I'm sorry I can't hug you again.
Thank you for everything you do for me, Mom.
I'm going to heaven now, and I'll help you out there.
This is the case of the Italian government.
They were both Gloria Trevisan and her cousin Marco Gotttti, who was forced to find work last year, moved to London in the north of the country.
In the country, however, Gloria Trevissan, who had found an unsatisfactory job, began to work in London as a short time of 18800 pounds (2060 eurio).
"Gloria went to London to help her family to help her family."
Unfortunately, our young people have to leave the country to save their future and find a job.
The government must find a solution right now.
Italy's drama that doesn't allow young people to work.
Gloria's father, Loriis Trevissan, said, "It's a mistake of our government that tries to run away from our young people to find jobs."
When an unemployment rate reached 12% in Italy, the average rate between young people is 40%.
Over the past few years, many Italian young people have moved to many European countries, including England.
Only last year, the number of young people who had to leave Italy was 110.
In comments about the destruction of Gloria Trevisan and Marco Gottdy's deaths, there was a country where there was a country that couldn't allow young people to work.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate can make it easier
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your system.
But a new study claims that a rich diet of meat proteins and milk products can help reduce the symptoms of those who suffer from disease.
In the United States, this unproductive health condition affects about 300 million people in the United Kingdom and causes the brains and fats, or blood loss, and overweight fatigue.
Although it is recommended to reduce the symptoms of meat and milk products, researchers at the University of Washington found that the proteoporosis of the protein contributes to the development of a aminocytosis, which has been used to increase the growth of the immune response.
Dr. Marco Colonna said that the germs that hide in food do not go secret in the body to the body.
The cells that are involved in triggering the triggering the damage to the cell are compared to the cells that encourage the immune tissues that encourage the damage.
If Denge is too much to breathe, the medicine can be fatal.
In the experiments, there was evidence of a type of drug that stimulates a seismic bacteria in the rats.
And the bacteria need a stripptophan from one of the structure of the proteins to trigger the formation of cells.
Professor Colonna said, "The nature of bacteria that are part of my microbiology has been linked to the development of the cell that promotes stability.
The rats who had more fluorphans in their diet had more contact cells.
If the same thing happens to people, the L. reuter and a richer diet from the strippofan care would have developed a more positive, less harmful yeast environment.
Dr. Louisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, working on a variety of immune cells, found that a group of experimenters had these kinds of gravitational cells.
The difference was doubts about the bacteria, virus, and mantar groups in the channel of the rats, which is normally called the yeast microbiotics.
The DNA receptors of the rats have been discovered, and there are six types of bacteria in the rats, but there is no evidence of this inflammatory rats.
An altheli is given to the rats that have been found in an environment where they have no immune system and that kind of connection cells have developed, and they have become able to identify the immune cells.
In order to understand how the bacteria react to the immune system, researchers developed L. reuter in the fluid and then transferred this fluid from the rats that were not infected.
The booming cells are transformed into cells that encourage decay.
When the electron was turned out to be an indol-3-caltic acid, it was found that there was a side of the triptophan metabolism known as the indol-3-class acid.
When researchers double the fluorphan scale in the rats' stomach, the number of cells increased by 50 percent, but the number of cells increased to half thermophan levels.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan said that people have the same walls that encourage rats, and most of us have L. Reverries in the stomach channel.
The fluorphan from L. reuter doesn't know that the species of ferry have developed in humans as they do in rats, but the genes related to Triptophan have been found in people who are infected with the disease.
He said, "It's probably something we'd like to encourage these cells, because these cells are controlling the evidence inside the yeast.
In the case of the L. reuteriation, it is caused by the spread of this population."

The White House Show to the tax Engineers
According to military records, the White House's policy to prevent the production of the United States last month has cost up to $240,000 to the European settlers in the south.
When the president arrived, Marine One, also known as the white Skikorsky VH-3D, was an interesting link to the United States building program on July 17 July.
President Donald Trump, President Mike Pence and senior White House officers have traveled all over 50 countries.
Heipopter, who was built in Connecticut, was also well known to have a fire truck from Wisconsin and a form of Mississippi.
According to the reports of Marine Heliopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the White House of Home (FRAGO) asked for an active command (FRAGO) to "dependent organization".
I wanted to make sure it was an e-mail organization that was a very unusually different from HMX-1.
The message was announced that he would come for the organization in the south of July 17th morning, and that he would stay there until noon at 6:00 p.m.
If it's late from the White House, it was announced that there would be a second flight team for the flight of the mission clock.
The unit of security was in the helicopter while the original flight crew was standing on the ground.
It's not clear that a second flight crew has to be required.
Even the law prohibits federal workers to use the government's property for political purposes.
Records show that HMX-1 has been questioned that the organization doesn't violate this form.
"A question we've asked has not been violated by Hatch Law, and it has been reported that he didn't.
And he said, "It looks like you're locked."
The "Made in America" organization is defined as an official organization by the White House and does not enter the Bitch Law.
But the official organisations are also political advancements.
The president of the agency, then, was moved to reform the reform of health services that continued in the Senate, and praised the efforts of government planning.
Marine One or Air Force One is not the only thing to use air transport as a political purpose.
The presidents need to use these to travel.
But it's unusual to be asked to be used as an image for a photography opportunity.
Trump was careful when the presidential flight took place in Melbourne in Florida in February, and when Twitter's account of the use of the presidential plane was taken into consideration by the presidential plane.
"Beyaz Saray, 50 states Americans are excited about the American series of products made by American workers all over the world."
The HMX-1 crew is often doing educational flights in Washington, and in the south corner of the United States has been trained to leave the President of the United States to the White House.
During the morning of Trump, in Germany for the G-20 summit, HMX-1 White House was completed at 58 degrees in the HMX-1 White House.
An officer said that the flight for the U.S. organization of the U.S.A. was supposed to require training in that month.
The British helicopters flew an extra 11 hours for "not really interested in support tasks" that day.
White House said the tax inspectors didn't get paid for any number of other numbers in the organization.
A word from Skikorsky said heloopter didn't join firms in the south.
HMX-1 is not keeping budget records for the president's flights, and it's hard to determine the permanent result that has been attacked by the organization.
However, according to the U.S. Department of Defense for 2017, the Ministry of Defense is $24.40 per hour to meet VH-3D.
The unit records are recorded for 30 minutes each side from the main base in Marine Corps Air Facilty Quantico Virginia.
The White House asserts that heloopter's going to be a real co-operator is under there.
He said, "Vergi to his clients, to get out of the space to get out of the way by counting the cost of payment."
"This range of guesses cover the resources of the fish in labor, care, and year after year."
According to a 2015 RAND survey, the Ministry of Defense is not involved in the transfer of the Ministry of Defense, but is involved in fueling, maintenance, and contracts.
At the time, the old title of the White House was confirmed that Sean Spicer heopterin was used for this organization.
He said, "What's done here in Anaficire America is this weekend."
"And I know that Sikorsky and the Connecticut state are much more proud of what they do to our national security, and I think it's all about hundreds of people.
And I think many Americans, like most Americans, are proud of us all with the helicopters and other military teams to do it.
That is the fairest way."
During Trump's walking through the south-west mud for the organization, he didn't come into contact with the helicopter, but he took steps to drive a fire truck.
In the White House, Trump called on the company's firms with his own fleet Sikorsky.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three of them."
