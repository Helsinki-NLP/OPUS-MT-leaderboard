AMs from Wales fear they "will be seen as foolish"
There is consternation among some AMs following a suggestion that their title should be changed to MWPs (Member of the Parliament of Wales).
This was raised due to plans to change the name of the Welsh Parliament assembly.
AMs across the political spectrum are worried that this will make them appear ridiculous .
AM Labour said that his group was concerned that "it has the same sound as Twp and Pwp."
For readers from outside Wales: In the Welsh language, twp means ibleh and pwp means raw.
AM of Plaid said the whole group 'was unhappy and suggested alternatives.
A Conservative from Wales said his group had an "open mind" about the name change, but noted that there was a slight verbal difference from MWP to "Muppet".
In this context the letter w in the Welsh language is pronounced in a similar way to the pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptor of that should be called Assembly Members will of course be a matter for the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 empowered the Welsh Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals that had broad support for the assembly to be called a Parliament of Wales.
On the issue of the title of the AMs, the Commission favoured Members of the Parliament of Wales or WMPs, but MWP received the most support in a public consultation.
Apparently, AMs are suggesting alternative options, but the difficulty of reaching consensus could be a headache for the presiding Officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft legislation on the changes within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AMs will have the final vote on the issue of how to be called when they have a debate on legislation.
In Macedonia they leave to public opinion in a referendum on the change of the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "North Macedonian Republic."
The popular vote was set up with the aim of settling a decades-long dispute with the neighboring country of Greece, which has its own province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor's name represents .
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite over the change of name, said he would ignore the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the consequence of entering the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells stop ringing as churches in Harlem are sending
"Historically, the elders I spoke to say there was a bar and a church in every corner," Mr Adams said.
"Today, there is none."
He said he could understand how the bars disappeared.
He said, "People are socializing in a different way" today.
"Bars are no longer the center of activity of the locality where people go on a regular basis."
As for the churches, he worries that the money from the asset sale will not last as long as the leaders think, "and sooner or later they will be back where they were in the beginning."
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment blocks with condominiums filled with the kind of people who will not help the rest of the local shrines.
"The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in this building would be white carnations," he said, "and thus, they will not be bothered when the day comes that they will be created for these churches because it is likely that many of these people who enter to live in these condominiums will not become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by congregations of white carnation people before Harlem became a metropolis of white carnation people - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St.Martin's ten years later.
The original Methodist Congregation of white carnation people left in the 1930s.
A congregation of people of black carnation who were practicing the nearby religion took the title for the building.
St. Martin's was taken from a congregation of black carrot people under Rev. John Howard Johnson, who ran a boycott of retailers at 125 Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, which resisted hiring or promoting carrot people.
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged, but as Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, they commissioned the carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson's and successor to St. Martin's, was proud when he called the carillon "the bells of the people."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: "Cultural treasure" and "a unique historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that she was the first carillon in the world to have a black carnation musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the largest carillon in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's has not changed with anyone else.
What happened in St. Martin's over the past few months was a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay church leaders, others from the Episcopal diocese.
The 'vestry' - the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders - wrote the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese would "seek to pass on the costs" to the vestry, although the vestry was not involved in engaging the architects and contractors who sent it from the dioceses.
Some of them complained about a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
The shark injures a 13-year-old boy during a lobster lick in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while sneezing for the lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. where Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was sleeping with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy shouting for help and then went over to him with a group to help him draw out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was the after-excitement to catch a lobster, but then "I realised he was shouting, ‘Gidimni!
Giddy-up!"
"It's been a long time since I've had the baby and I've had the whole baby," Hammel said, adding that he realized the moment he had come to where the baby was.
"I cried out for everyone to come out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
They took the boy by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
Lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles said in a meeting with the media that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a species of dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of the torso.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablade to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing against Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with racked corridors similar to those of a ‘department store' of beauty products equipped with specialist assistants.
As part of the UK's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as sales of clothing and goods for domestic use decline, larger corridors with beauty products will be tested in 11 stores across the country and the idea will spread to more stores this year.
The investment in beauty came after supermarkets were looking for ways to use space on shelves that was once used for TVs, microwaves and items for domestic use.
Sainsbury's said it will double the amount of beauty items it is offering up to 3000 items, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will have more space with branded areas similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket will also relaunch its range of boutique make-up so that the majority of products are vegan - something that is increasingly demanded by smaller buyers.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will examine concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, in lower London, last week, while the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and switching to buying small amounts of food every day at local convenience stores means supermarkets are having to do more to persuade people to buy from there.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's chief executive, said shops will increasingly look like 'department stores' as the supermarket chain tries to fight Aldi and Lidl with more services and its non-food product.
Sainsbury's has been placing Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitats since it bought the two chains two years ago, which it says has boosted grocery sales and made purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the tie came to an end after a fight over how to split income from the pharmacies in his supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold the pharmacy business with 281 stores to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, three years ago.
Lloyds will play a role in the plan, he said, adding an extended range of luxury leather care firms including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands has been designed to suit every need and the attractive environment and convenient positions of the shops mean that we have become a destination of beauty products of interest challenging the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'extremely rugged' after Holly Willoughby cancels <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons character Den Peter Jones 'very angry' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby canceled a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle firm's business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time for the firm of household products and their accessories, Truly.
The pair's business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's firm, Goop.
The presenter of This Morning, 37, appeared on Instagram to announce that she is leaving.
Holly Willoughby left a Dragons' character Den Peter Jones very angry because she was cancelled from being part of their business of a cash-strapped lifestyle firm at the last minute - to focus on her big contracts with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "very angry" when the very popular television personality admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his enromised business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, whose new deals - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant that he didn't have enough time to pay.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop firm and was thought to double Willoughby's estimated wealth of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
As soon as Willoughby, 37, appeared on Instagram to announce that she would leave with Truly, Jones left Britain and went to one of his private holidaymakers.
A source said: "Truly it was by far Holly's first priority.
It would be her long-term future that would fill the next few decades.
Her decision to leave left everyone completely stunned.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, the launch was almost over.
There is a filled warehouse produced at Marlow's headquarters that are ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of this morning's presenter, who is among Britain's profit-making personalities, could mean a cost of millions for the company due to a large investment in products from pillows and candles to clothing and household products, and the potential for further delay until its launch.
And it can mean the end of a long friendship.
A mother of three, Willoughby and her brother-in-law Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined them as chairman in March.
The couples travel together and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is set to become an M<0x26>S brand ambassador and will succeed Ant McPartlin as a presenter of I'm A Celebrity of ITV.
Yesterday evening, a source close to Jones said "We do not comment on his economic affairs."
It's hard to find love, but it's hard to find love."
He joked about criticism he would get from the news media for making a comment that some people consider "non-presidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
"Why did President Trump give up?
Trump said in a voice that imitates that of a "news presenter".
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in another meeting after Trump boasted that their initial meeting in Singapore in June was a major step towards denuclearisation of North Korea.
But the denuclearisation negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders, on Saturday, at the General Assembly, that North Korea does not see a "corresponding response" from the United States to North Korea's early disarmament steps.
Instead, he noted, the United States is continuing with sanctions aimed at maintaining the pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his manifesto speech.
He said, "We're doing well with North Korea".
"We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people were killed.
Now we have a very good relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results - the end of rocket tests, aid in the release of hostages and the return of American veterans who had stayed home.
And he defended his unusual approach while talking about relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this arena full of people, we would have about 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroy island, kill hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they were not needed.
Even after more than 10 percent of Lombok's population had to move from their homes, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they were very clear that they were not asking for international assistance, so it is a challenge," Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to travel to Palu, it is unclear whether foreign personnel can operate on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, the spokesman of the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies could be allowed to contribute to the forcing of aid.
Considering the earthquakes that occur in Indonesia often, the country is not yet well prepared for nature's great anger.
While a refuge from the tsunami was built in Aceh, you can hardly see them on the coast.
The apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, despite issuing a warning, likely contributed to the loss of lives.
At the best of times, travelling between the numerous islands of Indonesia is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics more complicated.
A hospital ship was stationed in Lombok to care for the victims on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has upgraded the falling infrastructure of Indonesia, the center of his electoral campaign, and spent a lot of money on roads and trains.
But Mr Joko's administration sent in due to lack of funds as he faces his re-election next year.
Mr Joko is also facing pressure from sectarian tensions still in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of this faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to move from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the road, using ‘ Machetes', bows and arrows and other types of weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge equalises points at the last minute vs. Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea with a 'goal' in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was 27 metres away from Chelsea with his team losing 1-0.
He hit the ball slightly to his left before shooting the ball into the post.
The ball of the top most of the box as it ended came in the upper right hand side of the net.
Eventually, the ball dropped behind Kepa Arrizabalaga, who jumped to try to catch him, and fell into the net.
"I was trying to get into that position, to get into the ball and players like Shaq always send him forward as much as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming over and I missed the ball once and I didn't think much about it and I tried to shoot the ball."
Chelsea were winning 1-0 by the middle of the game after bringing a ‘goal' in the 25th minute from very good Belgian player Eden Hazard.
Chelsea's striker handed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic, before leaving to run to the midfield and then quickly entering Liverpool's midfield.
Kovacic passes the ball quickly in the middle of the field.
Then he shot the ball in a very beautiful way, leading Hazard inside the box.
Hazard ran more than the players in the defence and sent the ball into the net with the left foot and passed where Alisson Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool face Napoli at the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of deaths in Indonesia's tsunami rises to 832
The death toll in Indonesia's tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said early on Sunday.
Many people have been reported trapped under the rubble of the collapsed building due to the 7.5 earthquake that occurred on Friday and caused waves as high as 20 feet, a spokesman from the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 people, was filled with debris from the collapsed building.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was shot with a knife.
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 a.m. with knife wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, with a 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police urged people in the area who saw or heard something to talk about.
Investigative Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in the early stages but I appeal to anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to everyone, in particular taxi drivers, who may have picked up something on the dashcam videos to contact us as they may have information that is vital to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was from Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing as police say they are in the process of informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to re-enter his apartment but is being informed by the police that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He had no words when he found out what had happened.
Residents are being informed now that they have hours left until they are given permission to re-enter.
A police officer was heard telling one man that the whole area is being considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene with tears in her eyes.
She continues to repeat "it's a terrible thing."
At 2 p.m. there were two police vans inside the enclosed area and another van just outside.
A number of police officers were inside the enclosed area monitoring the block of apartments.

Cromwell's Parliament statue becomes the last monument hit by the 'rewriting of history' argument
Its removal would be a form of justice appropriate to the destruction in a manner similar to that of the Taliban, of many of the British religious and cultural artifacts carried out by its fanatical ‘Puritan' followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the present debate about the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The ‘iconoclasm' of the British civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the evil Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The excellent portrayal of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is evidence of a 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is a fully accurate representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th century conflict shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable individual figure representing one side of that divide.
His achievements as ‘Lord Protector' also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated."
A Chinese man who kills and kills a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan," was found dead with severed, bloodied artery near a lock at the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported.
A pig farmer prepares to inject the vaccines into pigs in ‘hoggery' on 30 May 2005 in Xining of Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly travelled with his cousin from the nearby province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and discovered a door to the pigsty in the open vicinity.
He said there was a bloodstain in his mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 250 kg pig had attacked the farmer and killed him, according to the report.
"Cousinal legs were bloody and mutilated," said the cousin, who referred to him with his surname "Wu," as quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan was not of Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up so as not to attack others, while police gathered evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking people have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, and the man was critically injured.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kg pig kept a farmer from Wales with his tractor until the animal expelled his wife.
After a farmer's pigs from Oregon attacked and ate him in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba Farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but the taste of blood can act as a "cause."
"They're playing.
They bite, they're very curious... they don't intend to hurt you.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remains will bring heavy rainfall to the southeastern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring flood rain across northern Mexico and the southeastern United States in the coming days.
Rosa brought a 85 mph, Category 1 Hurricane wind at 5 a.m. Eastern time Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it is forming a ‘trough' over the Pacific Ocean and is moving east to the West Coast of the United States.As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm will begin to push strong tropical humidity in a northerly direction.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical moisture interacting with the approaching trough causes heavy rainfall in the southeast in the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates to approach from 2 to 3 inches per hour in parts, especially in southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
From 2 to 4 inches of rainfall are expected in parts of the southwest, especially on a large part of Arizona.
Rapid flooding is possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered character of the tropical rainfall.
It would not be a good idea to go out on foot in the desert with the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can cause the canyons to become dangerous rivers and storms will bring very local blowing winds and dust.
The trough will bring some rain to parts of California's southern coast.
Total rainfall of more than half an inch is possible, which can cause small streams of debris and slippery roads.
This will be the region's first rainfall of their rainy season.
Some torrents of scattered tropical rains begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rains become more scattered late on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain spreads in Four Corners on Tuesday and lasts until Wednesday.
In October there may be some sharp temperature changes across the United States as the Arctic cools, but tropical areas remain fairly warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There will be a big example of dramatic temperature differences from the U.S. Center on Sunday.
There is almost a 20 degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to develop and expand again.
A large part of Central and Eastern America is expected to experience a warm start in October with temperatures in the 80s spread from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could climb up to 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be roughly 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast is pointing to high prospects for above-average temperatures for the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people saw Thursday's highly intriguing testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused her of committing a sexual assault that allegedly occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political fight continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming with the shocking last-minute news of Friday: an agreement drawn up by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh babasha when under the influence of alcohol and tried to take off her clothes when they were a post-secondary school-level party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate testimony, said that he is 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday saw it.
the company was counting the average amount of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen generally finds it difficult to calculate how many viewers there are from offices.
To put this in perspective, it is a size of an audience similar to that for the decisive football match or for the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinionators strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was at the forefront of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was just behind him with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, protesters were caught off CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning and were shouting at him as he tried to climb into the elevator for a hearing of the Judiciary Committee.
He stood there staring down for several minutes as he was being aggressively criticized, in a live broadcast on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to a country?
They said to him, "You have power, when many women have nothing."
Flake said that his office issued a statement and said, before the doors of the lift were closed, that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All cable and broadcasting networks were broadcasting live, hours later, when the Judiciary Committee had to vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate in full for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee the following week, which Democratic minorities have been urging.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had power, as it was evident that Republicans would not have the votes to endorse Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "taking advantage of politics" over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "taking advantage" of politics and weakening national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview after one with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson pressed his attack of the so-called 'Chequers' Plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was "completely insane."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson after LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting who killed 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on a charge of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate, WAFB reports.
After questioning Simpson, police said they admitted to having shot and killed Wayde.
His bond was set at $350,000, reports the Advocate.
East Baton Rouge Parish coroner's office he released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death is damage from a gun's head to neck.
The department is giving credit to the Louisiana State Police task force clandestines, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and the area's citizens to assist in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletics director Joe Alleva thanked the area's law enforcement for "the diligence and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The striker, who was 2 metres tall, was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 ‘rebounds' per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "lost" and "under shock" after Wayde's death.
"That's what you worry about all the time," Wade said.
Volcano throws ash on Mexico city
Ashes dumping from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern reaches of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center was monitoring various tectonic noises and movements.
Pictures on social media showed thin layers of ash that covered car windshields in the vicinity of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geography physicists have noted an increase in activity in the volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarisation vote on secession.
A pro-separatist group with their masked faces held back by riot police threw eggs and dust paint at them, creating a cloud of dark dust on the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
There were also small clashes during the day and police had to use lembubs to control the fighting.
Over a period of several hours, pro-independence groups were shouting "Don't forget, don't apologize" fighting against unionist protesters who were shouting, "Spain Forever."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries they received in the protests, local press reported.
Tensions remain high in the region that wants independence a year after the October 1 referendum deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters chose with a large gap to become independent, although participation was low with those who were anti-secessionists who made a large boycott against the vote.
According to Catalonian authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region in violent fighting.
Pro-independence groups had camped overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he had no hope in Catalonia's prospects for independence.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my mom and dad crying with joy that they could vote but now we're on our own," he said.
Despite having a vital and narrow victory in the regional elections last December, the pro-independence parties of Catalonia are sending in to maintain the momentum this year with many of their best-known leaders either in exile who have decided themselves to either be in detention and are awaiting trial due to their role in organising the referendum.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was recording the protest on his phone in support of the police, said the conflict was caused by politicians of both sides.
"There's going to be more and more tension," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of Catalonia's nine leaders jailed ahead of trial since the end of last year, announced he would run in next year's European Parliament elections.
"By standing as a candidate for the European elections it is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested after car crashes into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car drove into a house in Londonderry on more than one occasion.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 BST.
Investigative Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused to the gates and the building itself.
It could also have been used a ‘crossbow' to shoot at the car at some point.
Menga's goal wins 1-0 match for Livingston against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first 'goal' for Livingston won the game
Livingston, who was promoted, bellied Rangers thus Steven Gerrard lost for the second time in just 18 games as coach of Ibrox's 'club'.
Dolly Menga's ball shot made all the difference as Gary Holt's side was tied in points with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side did not win once off the field in the Premiership this season and next Sunday they will play against Hearts, who are first and behind them with eight points.
Before that game, Rangers will play against Rapid Vienna in their Europa League stadium on Thursday.
While Livingston continue not to have a division loss in six matches, with head coach Holt having not yet lost a game since he came in to replace Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses opportunities against bulky visitors
Holt's team should have been winning before he had a 'goal', with his live playing style causing a lot of problems for Rangers..
Scott Robinson managed to pass but passes the ball in front of the bar, then Alan Lithgow was only able to pass the ball by wide body after sliding to get to receive the ball from the blow of the head from Craig Halkett near the bar.
Those who were playing in their own stadium were happy to let Rangers play in front of them, because they knew that they were to the visitors and could give them problems at certain moments.
And that's how the crucial "goal" came about.
Rangers let a ‘free-kick' in and Livingston took the opportunity, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to help Menga, who touched the ball and brought it into the bar from the center of the box.
By that moment, Rangers were dominating possession of the ball, but were finding the defense of the team they were playing on their own pitch, not penetrable, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to worry about,
That style of play continued even in the second half of the game, but Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to accept the ball.
Scott Pittman was unable to find a 'goal' due to Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow shooting the ball wide after being handed another Livingston player.
Balls were constantly entering Livingston's box and were always removed from their players, while two requests for ‘penalty' - following Halkett's attempt on substitute Glenn Middleton, and another after the ball was touched by a player's hand - were rejected.
Phenomenal' from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
For a man, they were excellent, they continued to exceed expectations on this rising trajectory.
The style of the games and their staff have not changed much from returning to the main fight, but most credit should go to Holt for the way he has united the team since he arrived.
He had a lot of heroes.
Chief Halkett was very big in his games, organizing an extremely well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall with seven eyes.
However, Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they were playing very well at certain moments under Gerrard, there was a lack of standards well this time around.
Their last chance with the ball was not good - only once they managed to separate the defense of the team they were playing in their own stadium - and it is a sign for Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the rankings.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an received different reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September) there were people laughing and listening blue as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at repairing relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then left for Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to block a large crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many of his supporters showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - also voiced their voice, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome in the country.
The protests against each other reflect the separation of a visitor who is a hero to certain German Turks and is believed to be ‘autocrat' by others.
Road crash in Deptford: Cyclist dies in car crash
Cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and attended the paramedics, but the man died on the spot.
The crash occurred a few months after another cyclist died after being hit by a car and it continued on Childers Street, about a mile away from Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Road closures and bus diversions are in place and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prisoner: Six officers injured in disorder
Six prison officials were injured after a disturbance in a high-security men's prison, the Bureau of Prisons said.
The disorder began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialized officers "Tornado" were brought in to address the disorder, involving eight prisoners and located in one of the sections.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries on the spot.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to address an ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were cared for for the injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and may spend more time in prison."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year anti-riot officials were called to the prison to address a serious disturbance in which staff were attacked with ‘pool' balloons.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake city with Quick Flood (Drought Areas May Benefit)
Tropical depression rarely strikes Arizona, but it is likely to happen early next week as the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa moves through southwestern Desert, leading to risks of rapid flooding.
The National Weather Service has already set up a rapid flood watch for Monday and Tuesday for from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass in a straight line from above Phoenix on Tuesday, and approach late Monday with rain.
The National Phoenix Weather Service noted in a tweet that "only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a status of tropical storm or depression at a distance of 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950"!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane at a distance of 40 miles from the AZ border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with amounts isolated up to 6 inches in Arizona's Mogollon Rim.
Other southwestern areas including the central Rockies and the Great Basin are likely to have from an inch to 2 inches, with possible isolated totals up to 4 inches.
For those at risk of rapid flooding, Rosa's rainfall can be a positive thing as the region is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious issue, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial as the southwest side is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the drought monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing, at least, extreme drought, the second highest category," they reported from weather.com.
First, the route of Hurricane Rosa led to touch Mexico's Baja California peninsula.
Rosa, which will still be a very strong hurricane on Sunday morning with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, will be located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and will move north by 12 miles per hour.
The storm is encountering colder waters in the Pacific and therefore loses power.
Thus, it is expected to make contact with Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or early evening.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico can be severe, creating a significant risk of flooding.
"A total of rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California northwest of Sonora, with a possibility of no more than 10 inches," they reported from weather.com.
Then Rosa will move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and then will move from Arizona and south of Utah until late evening on Tuesday.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or her remains is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest of Sonora, and in the southwestern U.S. desert," they said from the National Hurricane Center.
This rainfall is expected to produce rapid floods dangerous to life and streams of debris in the deserts, and landslides in the mountainous terrain.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Four arrested after attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in an Excelsior Terrace in the Norton Midsomer area, at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
They took him to the hospital where he remains in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old teenager, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon, said Somerset Police.
Officials have appealed to anyone who may have a video taken from the mobile phone of what happened to speak.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'sends greenery and anger' to Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a demonstration in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "sent the greenery and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying an allegation by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her allegation.
On Saturday, the President said that, on that day, "the American people saw Kavanaugh's brilliance and quality and courage."
"A vote confirming Judge Kavanaugh is a vote confirming one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a jurist with an impeccable public service record", he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The President indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I don't dispute, but in truth, I dispute," he said.
"That's why I'm running everywhere to fight for very good candidates."
Trump has argued that Democrats have a mission to "resist and obstruct."
The first major procedural vote inside the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior assistant of the GOP leadership told CNN.
Hundreds have been killed by the Indonesian earthquake, the tsunami, with the number of deaths seemingly rising
At least 384 people have been killed, many carried away as huge waves hit beaches, after a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves as high as six metres (18 ft) fell strongly to the ground at dusk, while many were carried away and died and everything in the middle was destroyed.
The tsunami occurred after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came out yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and did not get up to run immediately and ended up victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not appear on its own, it drew cars, logs, houses, it hit everything that was on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had travelled across the open sea at speeds of 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the shoreline.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, bridges that surrounded themselves and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
Heavy rains continued to rock the city's coastline on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (PPPT) said in the statement that the energy emitted by Friday's huge earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
They said the city's geography, located at the edge of a long, narrow beach, could have enlarged the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of a collapsed building, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Communications "were totally sent and without information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were moving to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time the alert was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the upper floor of a building can be heard shouting alarmist warnings for the tsunami that was approaching people on the lower road.
Within a few minutes a huge amount of water came down hard on the shore, carrying buildings and cars with it.
Reuters was not able to authenticate the footage immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused severe blackouts which reduced communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities said the military has started sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees still need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has only been reopened for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths exceeds 800.
It is a very serious situation.
While World Vision's staff from Donggala arrived strong and full in the city of Palu, where the employees are sheltering armed tarpaulin shelters have come into the courtyard of their office, they have moved from where scenes of devastation on their way there, said Mr Doseba.
He said, "I was told they saw many houses destroyed".
It is a very serious situation.
As aid groups started the unpleasant disaster aid process, a few of them complained about the fact that deep-skilled foreign aid workers were not being allowed to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only start to enter if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
This has not yet occurred.
"It's still a disaster of the province's level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, 'OK, this is a national disaster,' we can bring in international assistance but so far there is no status."
By the second night in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, the friends and family of the still-missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that would embellish this history of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy was taken out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman trapped under rubble for two days near her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian Paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended early this month in Indonesia.
Others of those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional weight," he said.
Mr Gendon recounted how, in the hours after the news of the fall of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated among the paragliding community, he sent in a way, desperately, WhatsApp messages to Palu's competitors, who were taking part in the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, only indicated that they had left, but did not indicate that they had arrived.
"I think that means that the messages did not arrive," he said.
Scammers take $26,750 while ATM was being refilled in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker refilling an ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was emptying an ATM at the amusement complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
While busy with his work, another man "was running from behind Brink's employee" and stole a money bag intended for delivery.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rap singer changes his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West is changing his name - to Ye.
Announcing the change in Twitter on Saturday, he said: "The man who was formerly known as Kanye West"
West, 41, was nicknamed Ye for some time and used the moniker as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change takes place before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the program which was cancelled for "emotional reasons," the creator of the program said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious significance for him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, while discussing the title of his album with radio presenter Big Boy.
"So I am, you are, I am, we are.
From Kanye which means ‘the only one', to Ye only - simply a reflection of what we have right, wrong, what confuses us, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
It is one of a number of famous rap singers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
As one who used to collaborate with West, JAY-Z, also serves with or without dash and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that he would "never use the military to restrict the Mexican people."
Troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were being established throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support Mexican youth by giving monthly subsidies to those studying and opening more public universities free of charge.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal groups.
The U.S. should double the funds for the I.A.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in this area, says IA investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made after several parts of the U.S. government made IA announcements, even though there is a lack of formal IA strategy in the United States.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to be the first in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, since all other countries are much further behind than the United States, and we're looking for the next revolutionary step in the AI," said Lee.
Doubling the funds could double the chances that the next big AI achievement will take place in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that won the player with the highest rating of American Othello, and later was executive with Microsoft Research and president of Google's branch in China.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government competitions in technology such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when it would be the next one, in order to help identify the next visionaries.
Lee said that researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get grants from the government.
Lee said, "It's not China that's removing academic leaders; the corporations are doing it,".
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed inspiring people from universities to work on AI.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen their efforts in the IA.
He said, "I believe the green card should be offered automatically to people who have a PhD in the IA".
The State Council of China released the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
Lee said that China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funds to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations spend money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is intended to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that attempted to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has seen no action in several months.
The people of Macedonia vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The Macedonian people voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change its name to "North Macedonia Republic," a move that resolves a decades-long dispute with Greece that had blocked its membership offers to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the bee in its north represents a possibility of possession of its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change weakens the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether participation will reach the minimum of 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum vote reads: "You are in favour of joining NATO and the EU by accepting the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a reasonable consequence for Macedonia to enter bodies such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will respect the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state electoral commission said there were no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian PM Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted for the referendum in Macedonia on the change of the country's name giving it the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was mounting a small stage and preparing seats in front of the tents armed by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we have to enter proudly under our conditions, not on the orders of others," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and be part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favor because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said a result in favour of the name change would be "confirmation of our future."
A survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will take part in the referendum - an amount below that of the required participation.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, the participation must be 50 per cent and one more vote.
If the referendum fails, it represents the first serious blow to the government's policy in favour of Western ideologies since it took control in May last year.
Sergio Aguero, the Manchester City player, passes from all of Brighton's defence to 'goal'
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his 'goal' in the 65th minute look very easy.
The striker from Argentina received a ball from half the pitch at the start of the sequence.
He ran from between three Brighton defenders before running into a wide open space.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players with green shirts.
He fought with one defender before escaping from many more on the edge of Brighton's box.
Then he passed the ball to his left and found Sterling.
The English striker touched the ball for the first time in the box to redistribute it to Aguero, who used the right foot to insert the ball into the right side of the net by passing it from where Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan is.
"Aguero is throwing some problems at his feet," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about the fact that he was going to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were fortunate to have made a ‘goal' at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the initial advantage to Sky Blues in the Premier League fight.
That 'goal' took place in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball very far into Brighton territory in that action.
He sent the ball straight to Leroy Sane with the left side in a very nice way.
Sane touched the ball a little bit before leading Sterling to where the bar is.
The attacker of the Sky Blues slightly touched the ball and got into the net just before it slid into territory it was not supposed to enter.
City will play Hoffenheim at the Champions League group stage at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play in a spoiler vs. Rockies
As the Nationals were eliminated from the possibility of competing in the decisive match, there was no reason to make an effort to resume.
But the player so competitive Scherzer hopes to be the pitcher on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications that the Rockies have the possibility to play in the decisive game, which is ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West with one game.
The Rockies managed to get a chance to continue competing with a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday evening, but are still looking to get the division's first title.
"Despite playing for nothing, at least we can have the possibility of winning knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably be playing at the highest level of any point I can face this year.
What would you not want to compete in those circumstances?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start on Sunday, but they are allegedly inclined to let Scherzer be the pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will be starting for 34 times, had a practice session on Thursday and will be playing as a pitcher on Sunday when he is usually resting.
The player from Washington playing with his right hand is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 ‘strikeout' in 220 2/3’ innings' this season.
Trump's protests in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation relating to the selection for his Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"In November, everything we've done will be threatened.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is very big -- I don't dispute, but in truth, I dispute so I'm running everywhere fighting for very good candidates," he said.
"We're seeing this very horrible and radical group of Democrats, we're seeing it happen now," Trump continued.
And they are determined to take back power by using any means possible, you can see the greenery.
They don't care who they hurt, who they want to hire in order to get power and control, what they want, power and control, we won't give them."
He said Democrats have a mission to "resist and obstruct."
"And I've seen it over the last four days," he said, and was calling the Democrats "angry and green and nasty and rogue."
He referred to Democratic Senator ranked in the Senate Judiciary Committee Dianne Feinstein by name, and received many negative shouts from the audience.
"Do you remember her response?"
Did you get the document?
Uh, uh, what is it.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no..
The band is no longer a large band.
Don't listen to those who express their opinions
When I was asked by the local media to support my campaign, I was not impressed.
After all, I am the most recent MP on a list of Labour Party MPs who were not positively welcomed - because we communicated our views.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she fought against antisemitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, issues similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
During the majority of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the Friday evening General Council meetings were exactly that.
Unfortunately today, it is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more merciful and gentle" policy has long been forgotten if, in fact, it ever started in the truth.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and each opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable for the leadership of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues with whom I thought I had a similar political view began to expect me to change my mind and take positions that I would never agree with in other situations - either on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly - and, in truth, it makes no difference what I say - I am followed by a social media abuse with a demand that they remove me from my post as MP, denounce the centre's politics, and tell me that I do not belong to the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
Yes, I know that I have had more luck than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who daily face a lot of sexual or racist abuse but are never hidden from comments.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the fact that levels of abuse have become normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad group and with every motion of "lack of confidence" or change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years that has encouraged me to keep my opinions to myself, not to be so vocal and then everything "would be fine."
But I did not go into politics to do so.
Since I entered the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school pupil, provoked by the negligence of Thatcher's government that left my comprehensive school class literally in a disastrous state, I have sought to improve public services for those who need them most - either as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I've never lost my job, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been, in any way, confused about my policy positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I can say is that when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will harm our families, businesses and public services, I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in truth, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, it's for my constituents, whether members of the Labour Party or not: I'm proud to work for you and I promise you that no amount of threats that would take me out of my office or of political expediency would deter me from acting in all of them.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr, who have not yet lost once, climbs to the top in the rankings
Two attempts could change the result slightly, but there was no doubt that Ayr had deserved to win this very exciting game of the day of the Tennant's Premiership.
They are currently ranked first in the rankings, the only team out of all ten not to have lost once.
Ultimately, it was the superior defense, as well as their ability to take advantage of the opportunities, that helped the team, which was playing in its own stadium, win, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"We've been through trials during our matches so far, and we haven't lost one yet, so I'm happy," he said.
Melrose's Robyn Christie said: "Giving the credit to Ayr, they took advantage of the opportunities better than us."
With Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, Ayr were winning, but, a yellow card from Scotland's head Rory Hughes, who was allowed to play the game by the Warriors, gave Melrose the opportunity to try and Jason Baggott made an unconverted attempt.
Climo extended Ayr's victory with a penalty, before, in the exact middle of the match, he made a ‘goal' and converted an individual attempt to bring the points to 17-5 for Ayr in the break.
But Melrose started the second part of the game well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Baggot, narrowed the gap by 5 points.
Then it stopped the game due to a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who came out of the pitch on a stretcher, and upon restarting the game, Ayr continued to score points after an attempt by Stafford McDowall, converted by Climo.
Then, Ayr's chief agent Blair Macpherson was given a yellow card, and once again, Melrose came out with aggression when they made an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine, after a period of hard pressure.
However, the team he was playing on his own pitch started attacking again, and when he was given a yellow card for the action he did on Climo without the ball, from the ‘penalty' line, MacPherson touched the ball to the ground at the back of Ayr's advancing group.
Climo converted, as he once again did almost from the area from which the game resumes, after Kyle Rowe collected the ball that David Armstrong met through the box and sent Gregor Henry, playing sideways, to the fifth attempt of the side she was playing in her own pitch.
Still Game's personality seems to be ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game's personality Ford Kieran appears to be ready to enter the hospitality industry after it was discovered that he was named as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man who plays Jack Jarvis on the BBC's popular show, which he writes and takes part in with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next ninth series will be the last one of the program, and it seems that Kiernan is planning for his life after Craiglang.
According to the lists of official registers, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan was seeking to get involved in Glasgow's "very good restaurant business."
'The sea is ours': Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, hopes the court will reopen a path to the Pacific
The sailors stand guard at the naval headquarters armed with ropes and chains at La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue ocean flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are lined with the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
Recovering it is a duty."
Across all of Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, the memory of the coast lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict remains clear - as the desire for Bolivians to be able to sail through the Pacific Ocean once more.
That hope lies perhaps at its highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision by the international court of justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course is waiting for the result with positive thinking," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ICJ's decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will find, in favour of Bolivia's statement, that - after decades of irregular talks - Chile is obliged to negotiate and give Bolivia a sovereign outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - facing a controversial battle for his re-election next year - also has a lot to lose in Monday's decision.
"We are very close to regaining access to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court would decide in favour of Bolivia - and that little would change if it did.
The Dutch-based UN body has no power to grant Chile's territory, and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
That the ICJ's judgment arrives only six months after the final arguments were heard, indicates that the case "was not complicated" said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from favouring the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may not have been helpful.
"The issue of access to the sea has been seized by the current Bolivian administration," said Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate.
Morales' hostile rhetoric weakened any residual goodwill of Chile, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile, at some point, will continue to talk, but it will be very difficult to hold discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, denied the idea that court decision-making was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have an "extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the "opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - was using the maritime issue as political help.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not take place unless it can trust the United States
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm nuclear weapons is the first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to deliver on the promises they made at a summit in Singapore between rival leaders.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is set to resume nuclear diplomacy, which has stagnated for more than three months after Singapore joined North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is "hope in the void" that continued sanctions and U.S. objections to a declaration ending the Korean War will never force North Korea to surrender.
Washington is concerned about whether to agree to the statement without Pyongyang making the first significant disarmament steps.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about renouncing an armament that the country is likely to see as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for Kim-Trump's second summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest collection of massive headwear that will soon be featured in the main stores.
If you want to add to your hat collection or completely cover the sun, you can stop looking.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a range of strange and very large headwear for their 2019 Spring and Summer collection on the runway that crowned the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats are appearing a lot on Instagram this summer and these designers have uploaded their surprising creations onto the stage.
The object that stood out most from Valentino was an extravagant beige hat decorated with a wide feather-like edge that completely covered the heads of the models.
Other very large sized accessories included a jelly-covered watermelon, a seam hat and even pineapple - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks - and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the coloured masks had sewn lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than ‘haute couture'.
One creation resembled a diving device complete with snorkel and goggles, while another was like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you continue with this good style.
Fashion watchers predict that huge ‘bonnets' will soon appear in the main stores.
The very large hats emerge after the exit of 'La Bomba', the two-foot wide-brimmed straw hat worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The ‘cult label' responsible for the impractical hat that has been widely seen on social media has uploaded another great creation onto the stage - a straw bag containing almost as much as the mesh model she was carrying.
The dark orange raffia basket, surrounded by the tiny raffia twine and a white leather handle, was the most prominent creation in Jacquemus' 2019 Spring and Summer collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm expecting to see big hats and sea bags in the main stores for the coming summer - as the designer has made a huge impact, it will be very difficult to ignore the demand for very large accessories."
John Edward: Essential language skills for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain a record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, which is only reinforced with individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community activities.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, for their chosen career and for their role as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a personalised school curriculum, we are seeing that modern languages remain a subject of popular and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, he understands with his mind.
If he speaks in his own language, he understands with his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's recent exams, we can see that languages are at the forefront of the ranking tables with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved a Higher A grade.
The data, collected from the 74 schools that are SCIS members, showed that 72 percent of students achieved a Higher A grade in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those studying German, 69 percent of those studying French and 63 percent of those studying Spanish achieved an A as well.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now, as a subject choice, kept in the same regard as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that from reasons employers gave for sending them to fill vacancies, 17 percent were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming more and more imperative in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more prospective job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career one chooses, if one learns another language, this will have a real advantage in the future as they will have the ability to stay such a lifetime.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically puts a multilingual person at the forefront of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation and, with 15 percent, French is the only language spoken with a two-digit percentage.
That's why investing in language learning is now important for today's children.
Knowing more than one language, particularly those of developing economies, children will have a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages they can choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future may be.
It cannot be denied at the moment, in a global business environment, that languages remain very important for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland's young people.
The faut bien le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
On Sunday, LeBron will play for the first time with the Lakers in San Diego.
LeBron James fans have been waiting for him to make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening game before the season starts on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, the number of minutes to play is still to be determined.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers journalist Mike Trudell tweeted that, likely, James would play a limited amount of minutes.
Following the practice session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the schedule of the six matches before the Lakers season begins.
"At this stage of my career I don't need pre-season games to prepare myself," he said.
Trump's demonstration in West Virginia, a YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a wave of campaign demonstrations tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is Trump's first of five scheduled demonstrations next week, including stops in friendly locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote suspended for his choice to fill the vacant seat on the Supreme Court, Trump is aiming to build support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when votes are cast in Nov.
What is Trump's role in West Virginia and how do you view it online?
Trump's demonstration in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's demonstration at West Virginia online below via a live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who became intense over allegations of sexual misconduct with an anticipated Senate confirmation vote suspended for up to a week while investigating the FBI.
But the primary goal of this wave of demonstrations is to help Republicans face the November elections to gain some momentum.
President Trump's campaign said the five demonstrations next week were aimed at "giving energy to volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives."
"Congressional control is so important to this agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we approach the busy campaign season," he told Reuters a spokesman for Trump's campaign who refused to name him.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the evening's demonstration could gather supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract coverage from Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time last month that Trump will have visited West Virginia, the state that won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is losing in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team determined not to give up as they approach Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes may have been just what Ryder's Cup needed.
The swing pendulum of momentum is a completely invented sport concept but one that players really believe in, and never more than in such competitions.
So, where do you think the current trend is?
"These were in front with six points and now we're in front with four, so I think we're carrying this as a bit of momentum," said Jordan Spieth as he left during the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points in the front with twelve more to play.
The Americans, says Spieth, feel but that they have a few hurdles and have a lot to encourage them, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each of them boast three points out of four.
Spieth was accurate from tee to green and is leading by example.
That heartfelt shout of celebration continued to grow as he continued his round, making a crucial putt to bring the fourth match even when he and Thomas were two from under after two.
His putt who won the game on 15 was greeted by a similar cry, the kind that tells you that he believes the American team is still there.
"You've got to get into the depths and worry about your own item," Spieth said.
This is what each of these players has left behind now.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable Ryder Cup history.
The strange but sweet couple of Europe are four by four and are considered perfect.
"Molywood" were the only pair that did not score bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and nine after Friday morning.
That run, and the way their energy seems to move both to and from this live crowd establishes that they are the players who are offering a challenge on Sunday, and there is no more popular player to seal a potential European victory as the sun sets on Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at once on different holes.
But here we are talking about an early European glory for it.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon finished by Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, when he was put in a pair with Alex Noren.
Bogey and two doubles on the front nine put the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they never managed to get close to.
But there is no one to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are very fascinating to see closely due to peer interactions, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way a strategy can change in a second.
Europe played better as a team so it came here and is in the lead on the final day but this foursome session has also shown that the US Team has the determination that some, especially on the US side, were questioning.
Europe in the lead with 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will take a good advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's fourballs and foursomes matches in front with 10-6 over the United States.
Inspired pair Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made the effort with two wins over Tiger Woods who found it difficult to take their score so far forward in the Le Golf National for four points.
European side Thomas Bjorn, ready to hold the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American side that went wrong in the morning fourballs, taking the series by 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two parties, but could not come to the difference in score.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points from Sunday's 12-game single-player to hold the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first new European to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend are only the second pair to win four points from their four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
After dominating over Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs they then worked excellently to beat Woods who didn't seem optimistic and the new American player for the season Bryson Dechambeau with an even more empathetic 5<0x26>4 score.
Woods, who found difficulty in both parties on Saturday, showed occasional moments of brilliance but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in the fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting for the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes for a 2<0x26>1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are ranked first and third in the world.
However, it wasn't all the way to Europe on a beautiful day, with a little breeze in the southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, a great three-time winner, and Justin Thomas set the limit for Americans by two points on Saturday.
They achieved a brave 2<0x26>1 victory over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourballs and returned later to win Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4<0x26>3 in the foursomes after losing both opening holes.
It was only twice in Ryder Cup history that a team returned from a four-point difference while entering singles, although the Furyk sideholders need a draw to hold the trophy.
However, after being the second best for two days, Sunday's counterattack seems to be more than they can do.
North Korea says it will "in no way" unilaterally disarm without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were deepening its distrust of the United States and that there was no way the country would unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "considerable goodwill measures" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and vowing not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see a corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without any trust in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will in no way disarm ourselves unilaterally first."
While Repeating familiar complaints from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization in which North Korea would have been rewarded as it took gradual steps, his statement appeared significantly to have not refused unthinking unilateral denuclearization as it had done at Pyongyang's past.
He referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between a serving U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work towards the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump vowed to "denuclearize the Korean peninsula."
North Korea was seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to reduce tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "denuclearization first" and increases the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal in a coherent way, and even objects to the "declaration of an end to the war," said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can break us is a dream of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions are deepening our lack of trust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the party to this denuclearization issue had been South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a blockade."
Despite this, Ri's tone of speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the US mainland with North Korean rockets was inevitable after "Mr. Cutthroat President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said there was still a lot of work to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a timeline for this, saying "If you take two, three years or five months - it doesn't make a difference."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, on Thursday, told the UN Security Council that: "Enforcement of Security Council sanctions should continue vigorously and without stopping until we realize fully and finally verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions on North Korea since 2006 with the aim of stopping funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri in the margins of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, after within a few hours North Korea criticized him for making "gangster-like demands".
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site as well as a nuclear complex if the United States takes "corresponding measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he was seeking were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students make a course on taking enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has managed to make all of its undergraduate students sleep longer with the aim of fighting the growing macho culture of studying all night and staying awake thanks to caffeine.
An academic has found that university students in the first place in the world often have no idea about the real basics on how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, believing it to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after making a speech about the impact that sleeplessness had on learning.
"At last a girl came up to me and said, 'Why are they telling me this now, in my last year?'
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which began for the first time this year, explains to students the essentials on how good sleep traditions help academic and athletic performance, as well as improving their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students had serious insomnia during the week.
The one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a students' bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to tell them the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance would have an effect from a sleep deficiency, and the importance of routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term insomnia can increase the risks of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
Then, a campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of students right away.
But we believe they have a right to know - as much as you have a right to know the health effects when you choose to smoke cigarettes," added Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of being proud to "have managed to stay up all night studying" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that lack of sleep was a growing problem.
Ensuring that you sleep enough, and of good quality, should be a student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, severe fatigue and anxiety, he said - also to avoid gaining weight, since insomnia puts the brain in a mode of hunger, which makes them hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California, who is studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, having attended one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to insist on a course throughout the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduating students to do a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students should consider making an alarm for when they go to sleep, as well as when they wake up, and know about the harmful effects of "blue light" emanating from electronic screens and LED light, which can balance your circadian rhythm, leading to trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal defeats Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another period of sadness when they played abroad as Dolly Menga's strike delivered Steven Gerrard's split side to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
Ibrox's side were looking to make a record of their first win while travelling from the February 4-1 triumphal victory at St Johnstone, but Gary Hold's team only caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 matches as manager to leave his side eight points of Hebrod's lead away.
Menga scored seven minutes before half-time and the list of Rangers players lacking inspiration never seemed to catch up.
While Rangers now descend to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and only behind Hibernian on a goal difference.
And there could be more trouble for Rangers after Calum Spence's linesman had to be treated for a head wound after an object was apparently thrown by fans of the team he played abroad.
Gerrard made eight changes to the side that passed Ayr to the Betfred Cup semifinals.
On the other hand, Holt, went with the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week and would have been pleased with the way his well-trained form has continuously obstructed their opponents.
Rangers may have dominated possession but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They had to score just two minutes from the start when Menga's first-time lay-off sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder took his big chance.
Keaghan Jacobs' strong free-kick then found skipper Craig Halkett but his defending partner Alan Lithgow was only able to shoot from behind.
Rangers gained control but there seemed to be more hope than belief about their game in the third final.
Certainly Alfredo Morelos felt he had to have a penalty on the fifteen-minute mark as he and Steven Lawless beat him but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's appeals.
Rangers managed to score well only two shots in the first half of the match but Ibrox's previous goalkeeper Liam Kelly barely worried about Lassana Coulibaly's head blow and Ovie Ejaria's light strike.
While Livi's first goal in the 34th minute may have been when the other team was playing better, no one can deny that he deserved them just for their effort.
Once again, Rangers failed to manage Jacobs' good set-piece.
Scott Arfield did not react as Declan Gallagher shoots the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm to choose Menga to finish the action.
Gerrard reacted at the brake by switching Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the change almost provided an immediate impact as the winger shot at Morelos but impressive Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston went on to draw visitors to play exactly the type of game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett catching a long ball after a long ball.
Holt's side were able to extend their lead position in the final stages but McGregor held tight to deny Jacobs before Lithgow went open from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another late claim for a penalty as he argued with Jacobs but again Thomson looked the other way.
Almanak: The Inventor of Geiger's Connector
And now a page from our Almanac of "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, like today is 136 years old today, and WE ARE TAKEN ... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to identify and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger Connector.
A foundation of science since then, Geiger's Contributor has become a foundation of pop culture as well, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," featuring those unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What's that stuff?"
Rogers: "That Geiger's Contactor, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these cuffs, you can actually hear the effects of atoms giving off radioactivity in minerals."

A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" cells with abnormal behavior
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" cells with abnormal behavior and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cells with abnormal behavior as part of treatment.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, which are converted into a laboratory.
They can then "see" a protein common to many cancers and then be re-injected.
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognise cells with abnormal behavior, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting the immune cells from a patient, they are changed in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers called HER2, then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of various types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explained Prof Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and how to "teach" how to target cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West carried out a Verbal Attack in favor of Trump, while wearing a MAGA Berritta, After his Appearance on SNL.
That's not a good
Kanye West was bullied at the studio during Saturday Night Live after a confusing performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would stand for election in 2020.
After singing his third song of the night, entitled Ghost Town in which he wore a make-America great breeze, he began to speak out against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to a white person and ask, 'How can you please Trump, what a racist?'
If I were concerned about racism, I would have left America," he said.
SNL began the program with a sketch of the comedy featuring Matt Damon in which Hollywood star Brett Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee about sexual assault claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, West's video was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to joke with West when he posted it.
In addition, West had complained to the audience that they had caught up with him after the quinta about his beretta.
"I'm behind the curtains.
He said, "Don't go out there with that beard."
"Shut me up!
Then they say it's lost," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the lost? and he went on to say that he would "wear my superman's cap, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try it with love."
His comments triggered a kiss at least twice from the audience and members of the SNL cast appeared embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there saying to the publication: "In the whole studio there was a great silence."
West brought him in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West confided to many with the performance of the song I Love It, dressed as Perrier's Bottle.
West had support from the president of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU TALKING TO THE BULL."
But presenter Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was simply "what he is and that's a hugely beautiful thing."
"But I did not choose to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothing or supporting their 'art') who I believe is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
"We're so different," she added.
Prior to the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying it was now "what was formerly known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The previous rapper, Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and of course the music legend that is no longer with us Prince, changed his name to a symbol then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Man charged with attempted murder of a knife-wielding man at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Magistrates' Court of Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington talks about toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series HBO Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor spoke of macho hero stereotypes, saying that such roles on screen mean that boys often feel they have to be violent to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed "something went wrong" and had doubts about how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his 31-year-old co-star of Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, also admitted he has "strong interests" to address the issue.
"Personally, I feel like I have a strong interest, right now - where have we gone wrong with masculinity?," he said.
"What were we teaching men when they were growing up, in terms of the problem we have now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity through his many male characters.
He continued: "What is natural and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, that makes young people feel that they want to be this certain side of a man?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time - how do we change it?
"It's very clear that something went wrong for the boys."
In the interview he also admitted that he would not make Game of Thrones prequels or sequels when the series comes to an end next summer, saying that "so many wars and horses".
From November Kit will appear in Sam Shepard's new True West production which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this program, so this is how she gave me my future family, and my life from here on out," he said.
Rose interpreted the part of Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantasy series she won in the Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials say.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted by sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people getting HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and Aids in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission by sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be common.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases come from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member revealed GOP senators' data, says "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on legislators' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat has ascertained that the claims were being disseminated by "ultra right-hand" pundits and websites.
"Lies, lies and more disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released allegedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The disclosure was made some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with the Waters office and released information of a Waters staff member, reported the Hill.
"This baseless allegation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"My staff member - whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - was in no way responsible for the disclosure of this information.
This unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is one of anger," wrote Fleischer.
"This suggests she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they should not be angry.
It should not be resistant.
It should not question the motives of the accuser.
It must be calm and serene."
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters's reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who will stand to take Waters' seat in the mid-term elections, also made his voice heard on Twitter.
"This is a great thing if it's true," he said on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said her office had warned "appropriate law enforcement authorities and entities about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the authors will be exposed," she continued, "and that they will be held legally accountable for all their actions that are harmful and dangerous to each and all of my staff members."
Criticism of Johnny English Strikes Again - Rowan Atkinson, imitation of a powerless spy
It has become traditional now to look for meanings of Brexit in any new film with a British perspective and this seems applicable to the return of the action-comedy imitation franchise of Johnny English - which began back in 2003 with Johnny English and came to life again in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
The ironic self-sacrifice on the subject of how badly we are obviously, would be the opportunity for a new export of the country?
At any rate, the incompetent Johnny English with his big eyes and moving parts of his face unusually had the license renewed a second time to do everything wrong - that's his name more than anything else shows it is a widespread comic creation designed for non-English-speaking cinema-going people's territories.
Of course he is the stupid secret agent who despite his strange claims to his sweet charm has a few from Clouseau, a hit by Mr. Bean and a large piece from that man who contributed one note to the melody of the Chariots of Fire theme at the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.
It is also originally based on the traveler and international mystery man that Atkinson had once played his part in the advertisements of Barclaycard TV, today forgotten, after leaving chaos behind.
There's a good time or two in this episode.
I liked the moment when Johnny English was approaching a helicopter while he was wearing medieval armour and the propeller blades stuck to his helmet for a while.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy appears, but humor feels rather poor and strangely overdone, especially since the film's "serious" marks such as 007 and Mission Impossible themselves offer comedy as an ingredient confidently.
Humor feels as if it is aimed at children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English's strangely unfortunate incidents were not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's speechless film jokes in Bean's persona.
The perennial topical proposition now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's highly secret web network of spies, revealing the identities of all of Britain's agents in the field, to the disappointment of the agent who was on the job - unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the cake cherry for the prime minister who is an imperious and struggling figure, who is already suffering from a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson makes her best with this character like Teresa May but there isn't much in the script to work on.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that every active spy has been compromised, she will have to get someone retired.
And that means the incompetent Johnny English himself, now employed as a teacher in an elegant building, but giving unofficial lessons on how to become an infiltrated operative: a few good jokes here as English offers a school-type spy academy of Rock.
English is taken back to Whitehall for emergency meetings and joins his former partner of great patience, Bough, interpreted once again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, with a submarine commander, playing a nailed one interpreted by Vicki Pepperdine, in which she is a little wasted.
Thus the two inseparables who always confuse everything in the Secret Service of Her Majesty are back in action, when they encounter the character of a seductive and beautiful woman Ophelia Bulletova interpreted by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the rule of the sweet tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of farce fun behavior: dressed as waiters, setting fire to a high French restaurant, creating chaos to board Volta's luxurious yacht; and English begins a full anarchy as he tries to use Virtual Reality's cottages to familiarize himself with Volta's interior.
Certainly all stops lead to that last sequence, but as friendly and animated as he is, he has little idea of a children's television.
It's quite moderate.
And like Johnny English's other films I couldn't help thinking: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role he really deserves for his talent?
Labour denies they are preparing a plan for Britons to work a four-day week but are paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is expected to consider a radical plan that will see the British work a week of four days - but are paid for five.
The party reportedly wants the companies' masters to hand over the remnants of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers by giving them another day off.
This would see employees enjoying a three-day weekend - but still taking with them the same pay.
Sources said the idea would be "appropriate" to the party's economic agenda and plans that the country leans in favor of workers.
The switch to a four-day week was approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"This will not happen from today to tomorrow but a four-day working week is an aspiration that fits the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of the worker as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day work week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, the aspiration is currently not being endorsed by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not a party policy and the party is not considering it."
Opposition Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to clarify his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "anonymous directors" and "beneficiaries" in utility firms.
The opposition chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not take back all their share as a Labour government can make a "reduction" based on perceived misconduct.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create Inclusive Ownership Funds to give 10 percent of private sector firms' equity to employees, who are willing to take annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" if Kavanaugh's FBI investigation can change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by a week, raising the question of whether the bureau's findings could influence any Republican senator from withdrawing his support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover anything that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Hell, and sure," said Kennedy.
"I said as I entered the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after that, after he made that allegation, I said, "Did I do it?"
He was resolute, determined, inequitable."
However, Graham's vote, seems difficult to change.
"I've already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and it must be a very big indictment," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And any person who mentions can't verify that.
It is 36 years old.
I didn't see anything new change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
Next Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has a very impressive list of stars to appear and an equally impressive mission; ending world poverty.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people leave for the Great Lawn of Central Park to not only enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the true goal of the event to end extreme poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a representation group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you were willing to pay a VIP ticket), the concertgoers had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, send an email to a world leader, make a phone call or some other significant ways to help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful was Global Citizen with the remaining 12 years to achieve its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way of persuading people to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivism" - do people feel they are making a real difference by signing a petition online or sending a tweet?
As of 2011, Global Citizen says it has registered more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, which it has insisted on for a number of different purposes.
These actions have helped encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements from its actions, at least $10 billion of which have already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the safe funds have so far made a direct impact on nearly 649 million people across the glare.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children grow to their full potential," with the promise that Rwanda will be provided $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of the denunciation a footnote in history," The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to invite the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on his website asking "what makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and hard journey - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the big civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed, because we have more power when we are together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among some of the artists to appear at this year's event in New York, to be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. uses Navy for "blockade" to hinder Russian energy exports - Internal Secretariat
"If necessary", Washington could resort to its Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including the Middle East, revealed U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke alleged that Russia's growth in Syria - especially, where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to trade energy like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern side of Europe," he reportedly said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means of addressing this.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, to block, to ensure that their energy has not reached the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing the event's attendees hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that stymies itself as the "energy consumer's voice" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches in addressing Russia and Iran, noting that they are effectively the same.
"The economic choice on Iran and Russia is, more or less, the leverage and replacement of fuels," he said, referring to Russia as "someone with one skill" with an economy that relies on carbonated fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration was on a mission to boost its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to pull out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas project that, according to Trump, made Berlin the "slave" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 gas-fired, which is expected to double existing gas-fired capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's intense opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position attracted an adverse reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has invited the United States to stay away from Europe's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will 'Examine Well' If She Leaves for President in 2020, Says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, Saturday said she would "examine carefully" whether to stand for president after the mid-term elections.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider getting out.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government and that includes a woman in the highest position," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will examine whether to go out for a president."
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the council meeting, saying that he was "taking this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren was direct in her criticism of Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll released Thursday, showed that a majority of Warren's own constituents do not think she should stand for election in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts's "probable" voters said the senator should not stand for election, according to polls by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Political Research Center.
Thirty-two percent supported the issue for election.
The poll showed more support for the exit to the election than former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting an exit to the potential election and 48 percent against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names that have been discussed in relation to a potential exit for the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide by January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin refers to Track Palin's PTSD in Donald Trump's manifestation
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being recorded in September
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he is going through after he has returned, I can relate to other families who feel the ramifications of PTSD and some of the injuries that our soldiers are returning with," she told the audience at a demonstration for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the obvious problem that no one is addressing" and said of her son and other war veterans, "they return a little different, return stronger, revert to wondering if there is that respect for what other soldiers like them and air personnel, and any other member of the military, has given to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was brought in on a domestic violence attack on a woman, interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support a challenge to a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new United States policy of denying asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and district, on Friday filed a case of a court friend in Washington to support an asylum seeker defying the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the actor in Grace's case against Sessions who brought the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and children sons members of his violent gang," abused her but U.S. officials rejected her asylum request on July 20.
It was held in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, producing a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations face pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants to escape domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Friday, in a statement, Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine, said the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims be adjudicated on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a plea violates this principle, said the case of a friend of the court.
Lawyers went on to argue in the case that the policy of denying entry to immigrants would damage the U.S. economy, saying that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary work."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop giving asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his policy announcement on June 11.
Asylum has never been intended to alleviate all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of deaths doubles in a fight against time to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation has become increasingly dire.
"It feels very intense," said a 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, as she was hugging her fever-stricken baby boy at an evacuation center in the unfortunate city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance brings the bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their homes destroyed, searching for their stuff flooded with water, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, destroyed by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures to his back and shoulder, remained outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients are being treated outside due to ongoing strong shocks.
His eyes were filled with tears as he recounted that he felt a violent earthquake moving the hotel floor on the fifth floor he was using with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have a chance to save ourselves.
I crushed with the remains of the wall, I think," Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in the place for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and her family.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper released a four-page advertisement in a daily U.S. newspaper attempting to sell the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China's paid supplement in the Des Moines Register - the most-sold-out newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of seeking to meddle in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in the U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in a campaign escalating from Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to make advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an escalating trade war that has seen them pass rounds of tariffs on imports of each of them.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and longtime former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in an opinion page in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now doubling this bullying by making propaganda advertisements in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the government of China is using America's cherished tradition of free expression and free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, on the newspaper stand down the street here in Beijing, you will find voices of limited dissemination and you will not see a true reflection of the different views that the Chinese people may have about China's problematic economic trajectory, as the media is found under restriction of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers avoided the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans Are Eliminating Female Voters Before Midterm Elections with Kavanaugh Debate, August Analysts
As many top Republicans are supporting and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh while facing multiple allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned they will see an adverse reaction, particularly during the next midterm elections.
Emotions about this were very high, and most Republicans are already officially showing they wanted to run by vote.
These things cannot be reversed," said Grant Reehr, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School to The Hill for an article that was published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute push for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
Friday morning, protesters sang "November is coming!" as they protested in the Senate hall as the Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to run with Kavanaugh's nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's statement, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be at a very high level," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst to the news site.
"People are saying that they were already high; and true.
"But they can be higher, particularly between female voters switching votes in suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who while disliked by the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public statement detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested she could pursue an adverse reaction if Republicans run with confirmation.
"This has become a complete shake-up for the GOP," said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"This concerns not only the committee vote or the final vote on whether Kavanaugh is put on the bench, it also concerns the way Republicans have handled this situation and how they have handled it," pointed to the news station Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect the Democracies.
However, Americans seem to be somehow split on believers in light of Ford and Kavanaugh's statements, with little more support for the latter.
A new poll by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's statement, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Ford's statement.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his statement, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the push by Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations filed by Ford as well as at least another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh while drunk attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while they were at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The Inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to compete against Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, will launch a new business looking to compete against Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's Solid open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what people have permission to access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said about the new business.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their "personal online data store" or POD.
This may contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
This is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser and all at the same time.
What makes the online personal data store unique is that it is entirely up to the user to access what kind of information.
The company calls this "personal autonomy through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is that the company brings appropriate resources, process skills and skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform brought in by IBM, some staff developers who have a contract to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralised applications through the tools available on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether they should introduce a complete change where all their business models are turned upside down from today to tomorrow.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established a World Wide Web Consortium at the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a voice of influence in the debate on net neutrality.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm a huge optimist for this next era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebrating the Victoria Cross of the First World War
The only Church of England cleric to win Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant was celebrated in his village 100 years later.
Lt Kur The Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the highest British military honor.
Saturday a commemorative stone was unearthed by his two grandchildren in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said he was "brilliantly symbolic" that the stone had to be unearthed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, the Lt Kur led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in much fog and fire from field rifles and machine guns."
He later rushed to the line of fire and with "the greatest courage" led the line forward before going for a rifle on the spot alone and losing consciousness three of the troop.
The Lt Kur was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never get there but something very humiliating."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also placed a garland behind the parade, which was run by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to have played a role in this parade" and added "the courage of a genuine hero was being demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people."
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, instead of ending up with Peppa Pig
Imagine this, you would have stayed up all night to see the Bellator 206 packed to end up being prevented from seeing the main event.
The list from San Jose included 13 fights, including six on the main card and were being shown live overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK remained confused when the broadcast changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed after they had stayed awake until the early hours especially for the fight.
One Twitter user described the change to the children's cardboard as "some kind of bulky joke."
"It's a government regulation that at 6 a.m. that content was inappropriate so they had to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the transmission.
"Peep the pig," yes.
Belator president Scott Coker said they will work on their schedule to include viewers from the UK in the future.
"I think that when I think about repetition, we can probably fix something," Coker said.
"But right now it's Sunday morning and we won't be able to arrange until Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we are working on it.
When I first heard the news, there were a lot of messages going on and not all of them were sweet.
We were trying to fix the solution, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a governmental issue.
I can assure you that the next time will not happen.
We will limit it to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - and we tried to deliver more for the fans and we went too far.
It is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley 'feel inferior' because of sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he has grown to feel inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but this has given him the motivation to become successful.
The 24-year-old said he hadn't realised until he went to secondary school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the first Desert Island Discs of Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he became less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-running programme, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
While appearing as a person set aside on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less than" others as he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to like you boys and girls."
He said: "Until today, those emotions that feel less than, and feel different, were the real things that gave me the power and the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something", he said, not to disappoint everyone when they eventually find out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became a high-profile promoter for LGBT and used his appearances at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt lucky to be able to live freely without ramifications and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world winner said that when he became in love with a man - U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "was a surprise" to him.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When he went through so many things at such a young age - he went to his first 14-year-old Olympics and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar beautiful and horrible experiences.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, for me the important thing was ‘I want to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know, there are things bigger than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the things he had asked was if they already had tickets for London 2012 - since he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you're not going to be here to be in the front row, <0xC3><0xA0>'," he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally recognized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to sit in front of a crowd from countries at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the first selection of his song - Heather Small's Proud - which was compatible with him in the Olympics walk and still catching the cold.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson who is no longer in form remains on the bench in the Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will make a record Saturday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to change his shape to avoid being a not-so-happy milestone.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial event for a 12-time record, remained on the bench from captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being the center of the action, as it was often for the United States, the big five-time winner shared his day between supporting and working on his game from a distance in the hope of rectifying his concerns.
One who would never give the ball right even in the fullness of his career, the 48-year-old man is not ideal for the difficult racetrack of Le Golf National, where the long distance lifted time and time again punishes erroneous shots.
And if the course alone is not heartening enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, faces the precise British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who joined Tommy Fleetwood, new to the season, to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, with four points less than the start of the 12 single games, start well, Mickelson's game can prove to be a very crucial point.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he played today, tapped me on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It's Hall of Famer and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't want to play two games.
I've seen more, but this is the way it worked and this is the way we thought it would go.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mikelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has rather never reached the milestones of its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence brought few intangibles to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, humorous, likes to mess with people, and a very good man to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players enjoyed criticizing him, this week, which was something fun to watch.
It provides much more than just games."
European captain Thomas Bjorn that the big position at the front could quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a sizable lead position before the last day's singles in the Ryder Cup can easily be turned into an uncomfortable journey.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side led by Seve Ballesteros maintained a five-point advantage over the Americans but ended up with a very narrow margin, with a 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 victory.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but with a little bit," said Bjorn, in the press, after seeing the 2018 Class win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday to be on top of the National.
So the story will show me and everyone in this team that hasn't finished everything yet.
Tomorrow you'll go with your body and soul.
Go out there and do all the good things.
It's still not finished until you've got the points on the team.
We have a goal, and what it is we try to hide from this trophy, and the focus will remain there.
I've always said, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we know very well what's on the other side - the biggest players in the world."
Satisfied with how his players played on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I never go oltr<0xC3><0xA8> step by me in this.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow concerns the individual performances we see, and this is something different to do.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there individually, then you're tested for your full ability as a golfer.
This is the message you want to pass on to the players, to get your best out tomorrow.
Now, leave your partner behind and he wants to leave and get out his best, too."
In contrast to Bjorn, the opposite number Jim Furyk will be looking for his players to play better individually than they did as partners, with the exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who earned three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on both sides of those last days that could change everything, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before losing as Europe made the "Miracle of Medinah."
"I remember to the very least a word of it," he said in response when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, prepared his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you want to get to it as quickly as you saw it in Brookline, as you saw it in Medina.
When that one-sided momentum arrives, it puts a lot of pressure on those midpoints.
We drew up our list accordingly and put those men in the way that we felt, you know, we're trying to do a few miracles tomorrow."
Thomas had been tasked with trying to lead the fight back and facing Roy McIlroy in the best game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of men this way because I think it covers the whole way," said Bjorn about his singles choices.
Germany's new war has been postponed once again
The German Navy's newest fleet was to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the ageing Cold War-era fleets, but will not be there until at least next year due to systems with faults and rising cost, local media reported.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the flagship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing a spokesman for the military.
The ship was to join the Navy in 2014, but the problematic post-delivery issues have tarnished the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships that ordered the Navy back in 2007 will come as a replacement for the older Bremen class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a strong cannon, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missile display as well as some cautious technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signalling.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - this should be possible to operate the newest frigates up to two years away from home ports.
However, continued delays mean that the state-of-the-art vessels - which allow Germany to project power offshore - will already be out of date when they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate F125 frigate appeared in the news last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm <0x26> Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivering.
Little was known about the reasons for this, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware flaws" that made the ship useless if deployed on a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessel will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the workers on the older Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it appeared that the ship has a well overweight which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is understood to be twice as heavy as similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the price of the whole project - including crew training - is also becoming a problem.
This is said to have reached a staggering amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6bn) - from an initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems of the newest fleets are becoming especially important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is dwindling.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the defence committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the Navy currently "has a shortage of ships to withstand deployment."
The official said that the problem grew over time, because old ships were commissioned but replacement ships were not provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust is named after the secret life of bats
New research being done on the ground in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape when searching for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common pipestrellas and sopranos as well as long-eared brown bats and Daubenton at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to track the activities of the bats during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
An expert analysis of all recording sounds will ascertain the frequency of bat calls and which species are doing what.
A habitat map and a report will then be produced which will create a detailed picture of their behavioural landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work such as creating pastures and how best to maintain woodland for bats and other associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and across the UK has declined considerably over the past century.
They are under threat from construction and development work that affects nests and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and light can also pose a risk, as can poisonous papers to catch insects and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
The bats are currently not blind.
However, due to the nocturnal hunting traditions their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated eco-location technique to indicate insects and obstacles in their path when flying.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, nest inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only reserve of bats in the Threeave land in Dumfries and Galloway, welcoming eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Threave we have a very good area for bats," he said.
"We have all the old buildings, many old trees and all the good habitat.
But there is much more about bats that is still unknown, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive."
He stresses the importance of checking bats for maintenance in properties as it is possible that unintentional destruction of a single maternity nest could kill up to 400 women and youngsters, possibly destroying an entire local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them or annoy them or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer for the Night Butterfly Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for most of our species we still don't know how their populations are going."
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape as lawyers prepare to search for a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo remarked rape claims against him as "fake news," saying that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are expected to court-seek the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward has been accused of raping an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that at that time he had paid her $375,000 to say nothing about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Speaking on a video on Instagram Live with its 142 million followers hours after the claims were reported, Ronaldo, 33, remarked the reports as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news," said Ballon d'Or's winner five times while looking at the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They must become famous to say my name, but this is part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is going well," the player added, with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they called "inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player seeks compensation for "moral damages in an amount that corresponds to the gravity of the breach, which is likely one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident was said to have taken place in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a discotheque, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her by the anus, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good man" disappointed with "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sexual relations, but that this was by consensus.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "terrified of retaliation" and was concerned that she would be "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to overturn the solution as she is still being traumatised by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack took place, and this summer he followed Italian football legend Juventus in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'forever regrets' the loss of automakers
The UK would "forever regret" losing its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was a "concern" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit would cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March we will see a stop in production at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Other UK manufacturers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will function, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers call supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line today operates on an "exact-on-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be border disruptions that industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep an inventory of more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production is stopped.
Mr Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls."
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that allows, as I say, not just success to be enjoyed in the present but for us to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4 Today.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers is that we absolutely need to be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say for how long production would be stopped, but in a longer period, warned that increased costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually lose jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the United union's contender at the plant, said its members are increasingly worried: "In my experience when these jobs leave, they will never come back.
A spokesman for the government said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump's risky meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could "be delayed by another week" as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein takes care of the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, links between Trump's aides and Russia and a potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will expel the deputy attorney general, endangering Mueller's independence, instigated Washington's rumors for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, despite reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, it was announced a meeting with Trump, who at the time was stationed at the United Nations in New York, which was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he "prefers not" to dismiss Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed in order to avoid discord with the Senate judicial committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both of whom testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct an investigation of the claims against Kavanaugh over a one-week period, which further delayed a full Senate vote.
On Sunday, Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she said: "A date has not yet been set for this, it could be this week, and it could be the following week because of all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But now we see and I always like to keep the picture up to date".
Some journalists dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a press meeting at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarcity of the meetings was not due to a lack of grace with TV journalists "trying to attract and influence the audience", although she said: "Although I agree with the fact that they try to attract and influence the audience."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president makes more Questions and Answers sessions compared to any previous president," she added without citing any evidence: "We looked at those numbers."
The meetings will still continue to take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has a chance to ask questions to the president of the United States directly, this is far better than talking to me.
We try to do this a lot and have seen us do it many times in the last few weeks and this will replace the press meeting where one can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump rarely answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences when visiting dignitaries.
Individual press conferences are rare.
This week in New York the president probably showed why he behaves relaxedly and sometimes strangely in front of groups of journalists.
Health secretary writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland about Brexit-related fears
The Health Secretary wrote to EU staff working in NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and desire to remain there after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter when it was less than six months away for the UK to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to entering into the cost of definite status applications for EU citizens working in its devolved public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations continued between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal, which are moving towards decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government has also been stepping up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know that this is an uncertain time for all of you.
That's why I wanted to support now how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Fellows from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
"Scotland is absolutely your home and we wish you very much to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie Performs Emergency Surgery After Suffering a Head Injury
Tennessee State Tigers' Christian Abercrombie linebacker performed emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on Saturday when his team lost to Vanderbilt Commodores by 31-27, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State's head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the halftime.
"He went over the sideline and like fell there," said Reed.
The trainers and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him in the back for further examination.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was no longer being operated at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no detail yet on the type/extent of the injury" and the State of Tennessee is trying to understand when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a student in the university's second year suspended, is in his first season with the State of Tennessee after leaving Illinois.
On Saturday in total he had five tackles before leaving the game, leading to his 18-tackle total of the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged more stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged more stamp duty when buying property in the UK with the extra money used to help homeless people under new Tory plans
This change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on those who are not paying tax in the UK
The Treasury expects it to rise to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year - to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers must pay a higher stamp duty rate when buying property in the UK - with the extra money being used to help homeless people.
The change will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high-wage earners.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on non-tax-paying individuals and firms in the UK, with the extra money boosting government efforts to combat street sleep.
The surcharge - which is additional to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and rental purpose purchases - could be 3%.
The Treasury expects this change to rise to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
Around 13 per cent of the newly built properties in London are purchased by non-UK residents, which are increasing prices making it more difficult for new buyers to take the first step in the housing purchase phases.
Many wealthy areas of the country - particularly in the capital - have become "fantasy cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers spending most of their time abroad.
The new policy came just weeks after Boris Johnson asked for stamp duty cuts to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction firms of keeping property prices high by seizing land and not using it, and urged Mrs May to abandon allowances on affordable housing in order to rectify the "shameful housing situation" in the UK.
Mr Corbyn announced a series of eye-catching proposed housing reforms, including checks on rent and the end of dismissals "without any fault".
He also wants to give councils great powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my post to restoring the UK's dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
This means that we will be able to repair the damaged housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and find their lives here.
However, it is not fair that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies find it as easy to buy homes as the busy UK residents.
For many people the dream of having a home has become too distant, and the dignity of sleeping on the streets remains very real."
Jack Ross: "My fundamental ambition is to manage Scotland"
Sunderland chief Jack Ross says his "fundamental ambition" is to one day become manager of Scotland.
The 42-year-old is facing the challenge of reviving the Northeast club, which is currently in third place in the League One, with three points different from that in first place.
This summer he moved to Stadium of Light after guiding St Mirren back to the IScottish Premiership in the last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and nothing more," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But when I was still a child I would often go with my father to see Scotland play at Hampden, and that's always the thing that drew me back.
However, this opportunity only comes if we succeed in managing a club."
Ross's predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic head says that he did not worry about the fact that he would follow such established names in such a large club, while previously rejected the offer from Barnsley City and Ipswich.
"Right now, my success will be based on 'can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'"
Due to the structure and facilities of this club there is no doubt that this club belongs in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I probably would consider it a success here only if I could get the club back there."
Ross has only spent three years in his career as manager, after a period of chief assistant at Dumbarton and after spending 15 months with Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third category, transforming St Mirren from relegation to Championship title winners the following season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he did during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
As for when Alloa took over, he recalled that "probably this was a big change."
"I really thought that the role of manager was the most suitable one for me, much more than that of a player.
This may sound strange because I was going well, I had a decent living, and I enjoyed some reasonable achievements.
However, playing games can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I still experience this in terms of stress and work pressure but simply feel that the post of manager is suitable for me.
I've always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it, and I feel like throughout my adult life I'm now feeling the most comfortable."

Survey finds that the best time to take a pint of beer is at 5.30pm
The summer heatwave has boosted the earnings of UK pubs in difficulty but has put further pressure on the same company's restaurants.
In July, groups of pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales - but figures revealed that restaurant earnings decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA consultant for businesses, who compiled the figures, said: "Continuous sun and longer-than-expected England's participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern to the previous month of June, when pub sales increased by 2.8 percent, except that restaurants were hit even more.
The decline of 1.8 percent in restaurant trade in June continued to worsen in July.
Pubs and bars whose main sales are beverages were the ones that did most well in terms of financial results compared to the previous period while restaurant sales declined.
Pubs whose main sales are food have also suffered in the heat, although not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
It seems that people just wanted to get out.
In managed pubs and bars beverage sales increased by 6.6 percent for the month, while food fell to three percent."
Paul Newman, one of RSM's analysts regarding entertainment and hospitality said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors in terms of take-away market sales.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to find it difficult, although a fall in sales of 4.8 percent year-on-year will be particularly burdensome in addition to ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for operators whose main sales are food and only time can advise us on whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide the much-needed rest."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including the opening of start-ups, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the launch of start-ups.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales monitoring for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups, with combined revenues of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is the industry's established benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts they hide from their parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts they hide from their parents and teachers
The survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in Insta's "false" pages
The news has great fears that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of students said they have a "key" account to show their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - are creating social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in Insta's "false" accounts - a reference to the site for sharing Instagram photos.
The news has great fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they operate a "key" presentable account to show their parents, while having private ones.
A mother who met her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found a young woman who was urging others to rape her - "rape me."
The research, by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of young people aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, with half of them admitting to keeping private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that many young people are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eiledh Doyle will become the "voice for athletes" in the Scottish Athletics board
Eiledh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics board as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is mostly a track and non-track athlete who mostly won medals and president Ian Beattie described this change as a great opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from her vast experience at an international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected in the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by becoming part of the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am looking forward to acting as a voice for athletes and hope to be able to really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Games in Atlanta amid his total of four Olympic Games gold medals and who is now a regular critic of the BBC, ended up not walking after suffering a minor stroke attack.
On Twitter, he wrote: "It's been a month since I've had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time can advise us whether or not to recover or to what extent.
It was hard work but I recovered completely, I learned how to smell again and today I'm doing agile exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
A breast pump ad comparing mothers to cows gives rise to different views online
A breast pump company has given rise to different views online with an ad comparing lactating mothers to milking cows.
On the occasion of the launch of what is considered to be "the world's first wearable, noise-free breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie released an ad inspired by an ironic music video to show the freedom the new pump gives to mothers who use the pump.
Four real mothers dance in a litter filled with cow's straw with a disc that includes lyrics such as: "Yes, I evade myself but I don't have a tail" and "In case I didn't notice they are not nipples but chestnuts."
The chorus continues: "Pump out, pump out, I'm feeding my babies, pump out, pump out, I'm milking my wives."
However, the ad that was published on the company's Facebook page, caused an online controversy.
With 77,000 spectators and hundreds of comments, the video received different reactions from viewers, with many saying that it sheds light on the "terror" of the dairy industry.
Someone wrote "It was a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us they need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, except that their babies are taken within a few days of giving birth".

Another commented: "One understands that this is traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers holding their babies?"
Someone else added: "Advertising is really detached from reality."
Others defended the ad, with a woman admitting she found the disc "very entertaining."
"I think this is a generic idea.
If I had to buy one, I would have bought one.
The scent made me feel the same as a cow.
It's a little bit of an adventure, but I'm pretty sure it's worth it.
This is a generic product," someone wrote.
Someone else commented: "This is a fun ad aimed at mothers who pump (often on their workplaces or in toilets) and feel like "cows".
This is not an ad that praises or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they were all dancing with the non-reflective pumps placed in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who pump their breasts say they feel like cattle.
However, the Elvie Pump, makes no noise, has no wire or tube and fits into a breast-feeding bra without giving it to the eye, thus giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even come out while they are pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing the women who use the breast pump to the dairy cows we wanted to pay attention to breast pumping and all the challenges it brings, while showing in a fun way and in a way that one can relate to, the incredible sense of freedom that the pump will bring.
This is not the first time that Elvis has appeared on the news.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Walked Without Words to a Tension Camp at the Texas Border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply despite the fact that monthly border crossings remain largely unchanged, in part because rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to put children with sponsors.
Traditionally, many sponsors were undocumented immigrants themselves, and feared that if they presented themselves to take care of a child they would jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their household would have to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
"Almost 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of a sponsor's household are here in the country illegally, and most of them are foreign criminals.
So we are continuing to look for these individuals," said Mr Albence.
In order to speed up the process involving children, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, instead of after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear through a video conference call, rather than in person, in order to bring arguments in favour of their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those deemed ineligible for aid will be deported immediately.
According to shelter workers and reports emerging from the system in recent months, the more children are kept in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or distressed, which may lead to them expressing themselves violently or trying to escape.
Lawyers have said that these concerns increase in a larger facility such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is finding it difficult, due to the size of the facility, are more likely to be ignored.
They added that moving children to the tent town without giving enough time to prepare emotionally or without saying strength to their peers could lead to trauma that many of them are already battling.
Syria tells "occupying forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
While addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country's war now being in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were on Syrian territory illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "will be addressed accordingly."
"They should withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue to "fight this sacred battle until we expel from all Syrian territories" both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, many of whom train and advise both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-ravaged country.
Regarding the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions were right for them to return, and blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that led refugees to keep away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They are politizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib's last powerful major rebel has created an opportunity for political talks to continue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has averted a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where 3 million people live.
However Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists including fighters from the Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, who "will be destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura is hoping to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be restricted "to the revision of the articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Donald Trump will win the second term of office
With this logic, in 2020 Mr Trump will win re-election as long as, as many liberal viewers are hoping, the denunciation and scandal end his presidency prematurely.
It's "the most dramatic finale ever in a presidency!"
So far, it appears that the viewers have not yet satisfied.
Since 2014, time ratings with the largest number of viewers have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the time with the largest number of viewers, more than 1.7 million of four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" increased cable television ratings by even 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
"This is a situation that is attracting people to it because it is not something we understand," said Neal Baer, presenter of the ABC drama program "Designated Survivor", about a cabinet secretary becoming president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Why is it bothering me,'" Mrs. Scovell told me.
In this case, there is the value of entertainment.
Undoubtedly, unlike anything else on TV, the story titles coming out of Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Ignoring what is happening around you is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, this goes beyond being an informed citizen when at six you find yourself following a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "deeply backgrounded" sourcing for his book "Fear," the $5,000 bomber jacket with the skin of the tooth-colored Paul's proudly-reflecting "Post," he said.
I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he's doing making it as if this is a reality show is that every night he's leading you something," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars", about the changing cast and development in the daily plot of the Trump program.
You can't afford to lose one episode because otherwise you would fall back.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, outside his house the weather was sunny with a temperature of 80 degrees in the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not be detached from the front of the television, not when there was Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in a precarious situation.
"I remember when before we were doing those eccentric programs and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but in truth they were right."

Large amounts of money arriving from abroad for the tightest races in the White House mid-term election
It is no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district is seeing a large quantity of money, thanks to a realignment of congressional districts that acquired two operators in a race for the same seat.
This recently re-established Pittsburgh suburban district pits Democratic Representative Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running as a candidate against another operator, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's 12th old district, extending heavily over the new 17th district.
The maps were re-established after in January the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the old districts were unconstitutionally jailed in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district provoked a difficult financial campaign contest between the main party's finance arms, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) (Congressional Committee of the Democratic Campaign) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after winning with little difference in the March special election followed widely for the eighteenth Pennsylvania Congressional District.
That seat was held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political critics gave Democrats a small advantage.
The U.S. Considered Penalizing El Salvador for Supporting China, Then Decided Not to Do It
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little help from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump held a welcoming meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama and held a hotel in Panama until some partners dismissed the Trump Organization's administrative team.
State Department officials have decided to re-contact American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said department spokesman Heather Nauert, in a statement at the beginning of this month.
But the penalties were only taken into account against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million in American aid, including narcotics controls, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be a burden for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings began to make progress, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to proceed, with the aim of effectively ending any penalty considerations for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has been strongly criticised for addressing the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration places on the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new and harsh message or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman, Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate that were described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
Their reports were supported by a foreign analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke about the condition of anonymity.
A study of history
The next unexpected negative event could be the report of special counsel Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, about which there is now very substantial evidence in the public register.
Mr. Mueller is also reportedly turning his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign was agreed with Russia in its attack on our elections.
In the event that Congress passes to another person, Mr. Trump will find himself responsible in that body, as he prepares to go back before voters, and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers.
This involves a lot of uncertainties, and I have no intention of suggesting that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable - nor that of his European equivalents.
There are choices to be made by all of them on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to perform a coup d'état against Hitler, which had been resisted by the West and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We didn't succeed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves with such points of reflection, and the inexorable path of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Today, the United States faces many of these challenges.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this document reported that, last year, he suggested that the president be secretly and speculatively recorded that he is not fit for office.
Mr Rosenstein said the Times report was inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the new requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or fair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual behavior and dishonest testimony?
And above all, in the middle of the terms will we vote for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these tests, it will take a long time for there to be a shift in democracy.
But I don't think I'm going to fail, because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz from the same Nazi regime that once occupied the home of my ambassadors.
She managed to live, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, on the day of worship God sent me to light the candles on that table with swastikas.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic ahead of a competitive match with Rapid Vienna
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the win against the Austrians, after the impressive equal result they brought in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from the Europa League Group G.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season to the 2-2 equal result with Villarreal but he believes Rangers can use that result as a catalyst for big things.
"This was a good point for us as Villarreal are a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went to the game with the belief that we could get something and come up with a point.
We could probably have won it towards the end but, all in all, an equal result was probably a fair result.
Probably they were better in the first half of the game while we went better in the second half.
It's going to be a big European night again.
We hope to be able to get three points but this will be difficult because they had a good result in their last game but, with the crowd behind us, I'm sure we can continue to do our best and get a positive result.
The past year has certainly been difficult, between everything that has happened with my injuries and changes in the club itself, but in spite of this there is a sense of positivity at the moment.
The team is good and the boys are having a lot of fun; the training is being good.
I hope that we can now do our best, forget the last season and succeed."
Women are worried about this fear related to retirement savings.
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wished to be cared for, few people were talking to their family members about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want to be a family member who cares for them, but they are not taking the steps to make a conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide life insurance business.
You have to start that.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't express your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive treatment, as those options can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Get your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Your funding options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid money value life insurance policy to help cover these costs or self-insurance at your own expense - provided you have the money.
Make a decision after discussing your legal documents in the long run: Avoid legal battles.
Find a healthcare proxy to choose a reliable individual to monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
In addition, consider a proxy for your finances.
Choose a person to trust to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your accounts are paid if you are incapacitated.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Explain these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just the finances that are involved, but who are the doctors?" said Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make sure that plan is completed."
A man has been shot several times by an air rifle in Iifracombe
A man was shot several times by an air rifle as he was walking home after a night out.
The victim, aged 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of IIfracombe, Devon, when he was hit by shots to his chest, abdomen and hands.
Officials described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "random act."
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries do not pose a threat to his life and police have appealed for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by an earthquake and a severe tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the number of deaths expected to increase.
With faults in communication lines, aid officials were unable to obtain any information from the regression of Donggala, which is an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake with a power of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, about the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central province of Sulawesi, located at the edge of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit the city, it was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a regression that extends over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regression, an administrative region under a province, had a population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the pillars of the economy of the Central province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
The nickel mine is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morawili, on the coast of the other side of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit by a tsunami several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami also struck the west side of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in the upper Sumatra triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the western province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, off Sumatra, triggering a 10-metre-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A low-lying earthquake hit the resurgence of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people remembered the devastation of the earthquake and the deadly 2004 tsunami.
This time no tsunamis were triggered, but more than 100 were killed due to collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the island's top.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's oldest child arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest child of Alaska's former governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering in a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone from her hand.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured $500 bond, the KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, declaring himself "certainly, not guilty" when asked to give his plea, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A offences, meaning he could be jailed for up to a year and have to pay a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B offence, which is punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with an attack on his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic assault, interfering in the domestic violence crime report, and having a weapon in his possession while drunk in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that she had been stabbed in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups after a comparison was made between her son's violent behavior and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not functioning with the number of deaths expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just off the centre of Sulawesi located northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
On the media are circulating videos showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore with great force.
Federal prosecutors are demanding that the suspect of the NYC terrorist attack be given a rare death sentence
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding that Sayfullo Saipov who is suspected in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people be given the death penalty - a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, flying pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
In order to justify a death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious physical injuries, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, these two charges carry with them a possible death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury gave Saipov 22 heads of indictments which included eight murder charges with the help of organized reclamation, which is typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
Describing the manner in which Saipov carried out this attack as "brutal, cruel and immoral", prosecutors said that the attack required "substantial planning and prior meditation."
The intent notice states that "Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov caused injury, damage, and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferrucian, Hernan Diego Mendoza".
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the Southern District of New York last prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers but was finally sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were killed after being convicted of conspiracy to espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were killed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he inspired himself to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his mobile phone, according to the head of the indictment.
He also asked for an ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22nd charge.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they are "certainly disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a plea of life in prison with no possibility of release will only further prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defence team previously asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest at the Tory conference, Nigel Farage promised that he would "mobilize the people's army" .
The former Ukip chief said politicians had to "feel pressure" from Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Party government member Peter Bone told the demonstration in Birmingham that so far the UK "would have come out" if Mr Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge facing Mrs May to reconcile her deeply divided positions has been highlighted by non-Brexit Tories who joined a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is finding it difficult to keep her Chequers' compromise plan on track among the attacks by Brexiteers, anti-Brexit and the EU.
The allies insisted that despite the negative reaction it would continue to move forward to try to reach an agreement with Brussels - forcing Eurosceptics and the Labour party to choose between its package and the "chaos".
Mr Bone told the rally Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted "to set aside Chequers' plan".
He suggested that Mr Farage should be given a high social position and should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been responsible, we would have come out by now," he said.
MP Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit but we need to set aside Chequers' plan."
When he declared that he is against the EU, he said: "We are not fighting world wars to be servile.
We have to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay is not absolutely true."
Andrea Jenkyns, a Tory Brexiteer, was also present at the demonstration, telling reporters: "I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chequers' plan is unpopular with the general public, the Opposition will not vote for him, unpopular with our party and with our activists who are really the ones who go to the streets and who vote for us first.
Please forget the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message aimed at Mrs May, she said: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage told the rally that politicians should "feel pressured" that they would otherwise back down from the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to get back from Brexit and we're here today to tell them that 'we're not going to leave you smooth if you do this'."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he said: "I want you to put pressure on our political class, which is at the point of going back from Brexit.
We are mobilizing in Brexit the army of the people of this country that has brought us success and we will not stop until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, anti-Brexit protesters marched in Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Following the group's launch this weekend, a small number of activists trended banners with the writing Tories Against Brexit (Tories Against Brexit).
Lord Adonis, who holds a high social position in the Labour party, ridiculed the Conservatives for the security issues they suffered with the party's app as it opened the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have all the IT systems in place and technology for Canada and more, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"This is a full-fledged quilt.
The idea of a good Brexit does not exist," he added.
Warren intends to "examine carefully" the possibility to stand for the presidential election
United States Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections she will "carefully examine the possibility of going out to the presidential election".
Boston Globe reports that on Saturday the member of the Massachusetts Democratic Party spoke about her future in a debate with citizens at municipal level in West Massachusetts.
Warren, who is a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will stand for re-election in November against GOP State Representative Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was at the center of speculation that she could succeed Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with constituents who have been using the format of a debate with citizens at municipal level since Trump took office.
A person who attended the meeting asked her if she intended to stand for the presidential election.
Warren responded that it was time "that women go to Washington to repair our fragmented government, and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrested in connection with the shooting of LSU Sims
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, La., announced that a suspect had been arrested in connection with the murder with the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims which took place on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson, at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
On Friday they released a video of the shooting, in which they asked for help in identifying the man seen in the video.
Sims, aged 20, was shot dead near the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
According to 247sports, Saturday police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media "Wayde Sims suffered from a gunshot wound to his head and eventually died as a result."
Wayde came to defend his friend and was struck by a shot from Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being on the scene, having a weapon, and admitted to shooting at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any problems and kept in custody at the East Parish Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims, a six-foot-tall youth who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton nears world title after his team's orders gave him the win against Sebastian Vettel
Saturday, from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that Mercedes team orders would play an important part in the race.
From the position on the inside in the first row, Bottas had a good lead and almost abandoned Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to enter the cut-off areas and allowed Hamilton to race with the others in the group's last place, something that had to be decisive.
Mercedes stopped in the stop area after another lap and exited just after Vettel, but Hamilton continued to walk after a little wheel action with a wheel which led to the Ferrari driver leaving the inside with difficulty for free due to the risk of falling back after a double move to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was in seventh place until the end of his first lap at the age of 21.
Then he was in the lead for most of the race by not changing his tyres with the aim of finishing quickly and jumping Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
Eventually he entered the stopping area in the 44th lap but was unable to step up his pace in the eight laps he had remained while Raikkonen entered fourth place.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did his job very well throughout the weekend and was a true gentleman said let me by.
The team has done a truly exceptional job of getting first and second place," said Hamilton.
That was a really bad physical attitude
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday in connection with her insistence that she did not reveal the letter from Christine Blasey Ford that she was accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "vile and nasty and dishonest."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that has been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see the people who are rabies and vile and nasty and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at statements and disclosures of information and then say 'no, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you reveal any information?
Remember her answer... unveil the document - "e, e, what is it?
No you don't see.
I didn't see anything."
Wait for a minute.
"No, we didn't," he added, imitating the Senator.
Feinstein you sent her the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July, and it was revealed earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the revelations were coming from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't expose her story," Feinstein told the committee, reporting The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it as confidential as she asked."
But it seems that her denial was not well received by the president, who commented during the Saturday evening rally: "You know what I know, that was a really bad physical attitude.
It may not have been revealed, but that's the worst physical attitude I've ever seen."
While continuing with his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three people, the president suggested that Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.
You see vilitude, disgust, they don't care who hurts, who makes the sticks in the wheels to gain power and control," the president said according to reports from Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League defeat against Belfast Giants by winning the match against the same opponent 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
Giants gained a two-goal advantage early in the game with two attacks by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie got the same score for the team playing at home before Dwyer regained an advantage for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard earned the same score for Dundee before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen goals confirmed their victory.
This was the third victory of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's players, who after several losses advanced to beat Dundee 2-1 at Belfast on Friday evening.
This was the fourth time this season that these two teams met, with Giants winning the previous three matches.
Dwyer's first goal occurred in the fourth minute at 3:35 at a pace from Kendall McFaul, with David Rutherford giving the pace while Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a multi-action opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt gave Cownie a pass at 15:16 that brought the same score for both teams.
Dwyer made sure Giants gain an advantage until the first break of the game when he made his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The team playing at home reunited and again thanks to Bouchard they reached the other team again with a strong goal in 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee an advantage for the first time in the game at the end of the second period and secured a five-goal win for his team in the middle of the last period.
Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, will play at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Dies To Ensure That Hundreds Of People On The Plane Could Escape The Earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being considered a hero after he died to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of people manages to land safely.
More than 800 people died and many were lost after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Heavy tremors continued to overwhelm the area and many are trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position at the swaying control tower at Palu Airport, Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He remained calm in order to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which at the time was on the runway, could take off safely.
He then jumped from the traffic control tower when he thought it was crashing.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman, Yohannes Sirait, said the likely decision saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan in order to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he left us this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"When we hear about this, we feel a great sadness," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands with the country's disaster mitigation agency saying access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is estimated that the number is still increasing because many bodies were still under the rubble while many could not be reached," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves, which reached up to six meters, destroyed Palu in which mass burials will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance brings in the bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being stolen everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia are working hard to help those who are still alive but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night in order to complete every evacuation-related task.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man is missing after a plane crash in the lagoon
The airline that was operating a flight that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says a man is missing, having previously said that the 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon, she was unable to give details of where one man's passenger was located.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and other crew members after the plane hit water when it tried to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven of the people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed in the lagoon just off the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had overtaken the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane went very low.
"That's a really good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to pass through the water that was high up to their waist until the emergency exit on the sinking plane.
He said that the flight assistants were panicking and shouting, and that he suffered from a small head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who were working nearby to improve a dock also helped in the rescue by using a swollen boat to carry passengers to shore before the plane sank at about 30 metres (100 ft) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that in the last two decades 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline accidents but no incidents involved Air Niugini.
An analyst presents a timeline of the evening in which a woman was burned alive
The prosecution on Saturday concluded its evidence on the case in the new trial of a man who is accused of burning a woman from Mississippi while she was alive in 2014.
US Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used mobile phone records to gather information about the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night she died, contradicting his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When mobile data showed that he was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford spoke on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that night he was in Sanford's truck, Sanford said he was "living, since my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for two weeks when she died.
Mobile records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, phone calls and contact information from his phone.
"He deleted it from his life," said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to pass to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip hop?
Three hip hop artists want to challenge the negative perspective of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claim that the hip hop has moved beyond its origins of political messages and is addressing social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and re-make the popular conscious hip hop.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent revival in the UK with artists like Akala and Lowkey.
"Another black man?"
Nanny from NY sued a couple for dismissing her after a "racist" message
Nanny from New York is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an erroneous message from the mother who was complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple denies being racist, and compares the case to "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flexman, a mother of two, expressed regret when she learned that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was a dark carnage when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"LEEEEEEEEE PERSUNA OTHER BLACK," Ms Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs Maurice, twice.
After noticing her coarse mistake, Plasco-Flexman felt "discomfortable" and dismissed Ms. Maurice, saying that her former African-American nanny did not do her job well and that instead she was waiting for a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms Maurice was paid for her one working day and then sent home with Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation in relation to the dismissal, and is claiming compensation of $350 a day for the six-month live-in position for which she was initially employed, despite being without a contract.
I want to show them, listen, you can't do such things," she told Post Friday, adding "I know this is discrimination."
The couple attacked the statements that they are racist, saying that the dismissal of Ms. Maurice was the most reasonable thing they could do, fearing that they could not trust her after they offended her.
"She told me something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racist people," Joel Plasco told Post.
"But would you trust your children in the hands of someone who had spoken to him by force, even if it was by mistake?
The birth of your baby?
And then come."
Comparing the case to "extortion", Plasco said that it had only been two months since his wife had had the baby and was "in a very difficult situation".
"You're going to blame someone for that?
It's not a good thing to do," added the investment banker.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly announced the couple on social media, insulting them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that readers would not relate to a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who's reading it for the first time before it's published.
"It's really fun the fact that we now know what we know about Paddington's great success."
She said that her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's book by a small play bear, would certainly have been optimistic if his work had been rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "pleasant but clouded some of his sorrow" after the year.
About Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she added that her father was proud of his eventual success although he never stopped talking about it.
"He was quite a quiet man, and he was not filled with himself," she said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a child to achieve something: be proud of them even if it's not you to have achieved something.
I think he was looking at Paddington's success that way.
Although he was his creation and imagination, he was always giving credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to give her the last greeting on the phone
Upon landing her daughter was immediately taken to Nice Louis Pasteur Hospital 2, where doctors worked to save her life but it was all in vain.
"Nad was calling regularly to tell me that the situation was very bad, that she was not expected to live," Ms Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got a phone call from Nad to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to give her the final greeting.
And so I did.
I said to her, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
Medicines that gave her doctors to keep her heart beating were slowing down and leaving her system slow.
She had died some time before and started to crumble.
All I could do was sit back and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't stop crying or crying because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold back."
Eventually Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who had so far been crying over the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers - who were unaware of the difficult situation she was going through.
"Nobody knew," she said.
"I had a headache, and tears started to drop all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the flight that I felt a great sense of sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her."
Post cards of distressed women to avoid suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been sticking cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, Mrs Davis's son, was 13 years old when he started suffering from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up every room."
However, he had to quit work before he died, because he was in "a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after he had killed himself.
Ms Davis said: "I'm always afraid that this will be the cause of another ugly event."
Ms Davis created the cards, "so as to let people know that there are people you can open your heart to or meet, even as a friend.
Don't be shy - you need to talk."
Ms Humphreys, who has been friends with Ms. Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, not so much after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he was feeling bad or depressed or so," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
On Christmas Day it was very bad - when the children opened their gifts he made no contact with them with his eyes or anything like that."
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but they want to fight her: "Leave a void in the family.
Disperse us.
But we all want to continue with our lives and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in a precarious situation as the FBI begins an investigation.
"I said, if we could get something like what he asked - a limited investigation in time, limited in scope - maybe we would have brought some unity," Mr Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "exploding" amid partisan paralysis that had taken root.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is entirely due to the choice of time.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, Republicans do not go well, in that case they will be severely weakened in their attempts to put the man they want to be elected to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush was picking up the phone to call the Senators, to persuade them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the F.B.I. submits its report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, where they currently occupy a position 51 Republican and 49 Democrat.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Mike Pence, the vice president, to vote and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea "decreases" under Kim
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, South Korea's legislature said.
Citing data from the South Side's unification ministry, Park Byeong-seug, he said last year there were 1,127 party changes - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and the higher rates demanded by human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang made no public comments.
The vast majority of deserters from the North are evely offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most of them escape by passing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross compared to the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two parts of Korea.
China regards deserters as illegal migrants instead of refugees and often sends them back to their home countries by force.
Relations between the North and South - technically still at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that were focused on stagnating the denuclearisation negotiations.
This followed the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work towards the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress made since then.
"Without any trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, we will by no means be the first to unilaterally disarm," Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," saying he is unable to work in the Supreme Court
House Minority Leaders Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court nominee Mr Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he is unable to work in the Supreme Court because of his temperamental behavior.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't think of the fact that if a woman had ever behaved that way, they would have said 'hysterical'," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both of them were still young.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes even shouting and choking when he was talking about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him "an assassination of the grotesque and coordinated character" organized by liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court, because it showed that he has prejudices against Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he went after the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi commented when asked if she would try to accuse Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm going to say something -- if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, so he's not capable, not only of being in the Supreme Court, but even of being in the court he's in right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as it is seen as conservative justice.
At his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would change certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not appropriate for a person with hysterical prejudices to go to court and expect to say, 'Very good,'" Pelosi said.
Women need to exercise their authority.
It's a fair verbal attack, months and years full of anger, and she can't say what she has to say without crying.
"We're going to have to wait until we're done," said Ms. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think this is a rare thing, what do you say?"
She added, "I was helped a lot by a woman who was well-dressed somewhere else, who said that even she was crying when she was raised, but she developed a technique that meant that when she was growing up and starting to cry, she would tell the person she was talking to, "You probably think she's upset because I'm crying.
I'm resurrected."
And then it didn't stop.
And I thought it was something brilliant."
Crying is allowed as a way to unleash one's great anger partly because fundamentally they are misinterpreted.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, where I once found myself crying with indescribable anger, was when an older woman grabbed me by the necklace - a cool manager I was always a bit afraid of - and carried me to the stairs.
"Don't let them see you cry," she said.
"They don't know you're being bullied.
They think you're upset and they feel happy that they've managed to hurt you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart when he was going to stand for the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a boat known as Monkey Business and exited the election, Mrs. Schroeder, widely bred, concluded that there was no reason why she would not explore the idea of going out herself for the presidential election.
"It wasn't a good decision," he said, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates who were going to stand for election, and the last thing they wanted was another candidate.
He called it "Snow White and the Seven Nani."
As this was at the end of the campaign, she was lagging behind in fundraising, so she swore she would not stand for election if she did not make $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her fans who would give $1,000 to her men would only give her $250.
"Do they think I'm going to get a discount?" she said.
In her speech announcing that she was not going to launch a formal campaign, she was so emotional - grateful to the people who supported her, nurtured by the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and to target voters instead of delegates, and raised towards sexism - which was smothered.
"You probably thought I had these strong brakes," recalled Mrs. Schroeder about the way the media reacted to her.
"I thought Cleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will be written on my grave?
"She cried"?""
How the U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The numbers of aerial bombings of the opening of the trade war between the United States and China have been daunting, and while the battle is still to come, a misunderstanding between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year by taxing major Chinese exporters including solar panels, iron and aluminum.
The most significant increase came this week with new tariffs affecting goods amounting to $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing all goods entering the United States from China.
Beijing retaliated each time in the same way, while more recently it was presenting tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion of American goods.
China has promised to agree with the United States every time, and it is unlikely that the world's second-largest economy will surrender in the near future.
The fact that Washington takes a step back means accepting the demands, but publicly the fact that China surrenders to the United States will be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China's president.
However, experts say that if Beijing works wisely, U.S. trade war pressures could support China in the long term in a positive way by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions to start economic chaos in both countries is actually much more dangerous than what spectators have previously acknowledged," said Abigail Grace, research partners focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help to rebuild the country devastated by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that targeted their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that since the start of the war in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country.
Another 6 million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime welcomes help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored the sedition.

I'm very pleased, very pleased that I got back the cup.
The team is everything, and I'm glad I was able to help," said Garcia emotionally after the European victory.

Strange statistics of one of the best players ever, winning 14 titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled throughout the weekend to find those parts of the course where golf is played with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-caliber golf throughout the entire tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance for his team, "I'm proud of these men, they fought.
There was a time this morning when we put some pressure on Europe.
We've argued.
Thomas took off the hat.
He's a very good captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We will reunite, I will work with America’s PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be a captain.
You have to pick up the hat and tilt your head.
played better than that."
