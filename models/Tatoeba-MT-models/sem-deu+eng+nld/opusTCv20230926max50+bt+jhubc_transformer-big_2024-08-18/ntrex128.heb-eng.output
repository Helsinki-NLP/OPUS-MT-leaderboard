Members of Parliament in Wales are afraid to ‘look like puppet’
Several MPs were alarmed by the proposal that their titles would change from AMs to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This concern was sparked by plans to change the name of the erased house to Welsh Parliament.
Members of parliament across the political spectrum are concerned that this will invite ridicule.
One Labour MP said his people were worried that "it would rhyme with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: in Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means poop.
A member of parliament from Played Camry said all its members were “unsatisfied” and offered alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his members were "open to suggestions" about the name change, but noted that the name MWP (the acronym for "Valish MP") sounded very similar to the word muppet (puppet doll).
In this context, the Welsh letter w is expressed in a similar way to the English expression u in the Yukshire accent.
The House Committee, which is currently drafting the name change legislation, said: “The final decision on any descriptive words regarding the names of the members of the House of Representatives is, of course, the decision of the members of the House of Representatives themselves.”
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh legislature the power to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of the public consultation on the proposals, in which broad support was given to change the name of the Legislature to the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the role of MPs (AMs), the committee recommended the members of the Welsh Parliament or WMPs, but the MWP option received most support in consultation with the public.
MPs are offering alternative options, but the fight for consensus could cause quite a bit of headache for committee chairman Aline Jones, who is due to submit a draft legislation on the changes in the coming weeks.
Legislation on reforms will include other changes to the way the legislature works, including rules for the removal of members of parliament and the structure of the committee system.
It is the vote of the members of Parliament that will ultimately determine the title of their role during the legislative debates.
Macedonians go to polls in referendum on change of country’s name
Citizens will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was set up in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Greece has long claimed that its northern neighbour's name is a claim to Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's attempt to join the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who opposed the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore its consequences.
However, those who support the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay to join the European Union and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church are silent in the face of the difficulties of the churches in the Harlem neighborhood
According to Mr. Adams, “the old residents of the neighborhood say that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner.”
“There are no bars and no churches.”
You can understand the disappearance of the bar.
“People’s social lives today are different,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the neighborhood living room where people visit on a regular basis.”
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of properties will not last as long as the heads of the churches expect, “and sooner or later, they will find themselves again at the starting point.”
He said churches would take the place of apartment buildings with shared homes housing people who are not the type to help neighborhoods maintain their unique character.
“The vast majority of the people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “and that will speed up the closure of these churches, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move to these apartments will join these churches.”
Both churches were built by white faith communities, before Harlem became a predominantly black neighborhood—the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin ten years later.
The white Methodist community of believers left in the 1930s.
A black community of believers operating in the area became the owners of the building.
The church of St. Martin was taken over by a black congregation of believers under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who boycotted merchants at 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 caused heavy damage to the building, but as part of the plans of the faithful under Reverend Johnson to rebuild it, they commissioned the construction of the bell caravan.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Johnson Sr. and heir to St. Martin’s Church, proudly called the kryon “the bells of the poor.”
The expert who played the trailer in July called it “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical tool.”
The expert, Tiffany Ing of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the world's first bell caravan played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who later played the larger caravan in Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merryweather said that the Church of St. Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in St. Martin’s Church over the last few months has been a complex story of architects and contractors, some brought by local church leaders, and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The assembly, which is the governing body of a community of believers made up of local believers, wrote a letter in July to the bishopric in which it spread its concerns that the bishopric would “try to roll the costs” to the assembly, even though the assembly was not involved in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the bishopric.
Some of the believers complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the bishopric.
Shark injures 13-year-old boy by diving for lobsters
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as the boy dived to catch lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hummel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about an hour on Saturday morning, when he heard the boy screaming for help and then rowed there with a group to help pull him ashore.
Hamel thought at first that these were just screams of enthusiasm about catching a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, “I was bitten!
I've been bitten!"
Hamel said that as he approached the boy, he saw that “his entire clavicle had been ripped out.”
“I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” Hamel added.
The boy was flown to Rady Hospital in San Diego where his condition is described as human.
It is not known what species of shark attacked the boy.
Rescue chief Larry Giles said in a press briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim sustained traumatic injuries to the upper body area.
Authorities have closed access to the coast between Ponto Beach in Casablanca and Swami Beach in Assinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty products market
Sainsbury’s begins a competition with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and opens department store-style passages with professional saleswomen.
As part of a major initiative to infiltrate the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty products market in the UK each year, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and home products fall, the expanded beauty products transitions will be examined in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, will be added to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty products comes as supermarkets look for ways to use shelf space previously seized by TVs, microwaves and home products.
Sainsbury’s said the company is expected to double its beauty product offering to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time in its history.
Existing L’Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt’s Bees product lines will also have additional space with dedicated brand areas similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket chain is also relaunching its line of makeup products – Boutique – so that most products will be vegan-friendly, a feature that is growing in demand among young buyers.
Fragrance Shop will also inspect franchises at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first of which opened in Croyden, South London, last week and the second will open in Sly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping online and beyond buying smaller amounts of food every day at local convenience stores require supermarkets to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said the branches will become more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight off the cheap Aldi and Lidl chains with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury’s has added Argos points of sale in hundreds of stores as well as a number of Habitat points since it acquired the two chains two years ago, adding to what it says have boosted grocery sales and made purchases more profitable.
Previous attempts by the network to revive its beauty product departments and pharmacies ended in failure.
Sainsbury’s tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the engagement ended after a dispute over how to divide profits from pharmacies within supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold the pharmacies’ business operations in its 281 stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
She said Lloyds will play a role in the plan by expanding the portfolio of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Commercial Director, said: “We’ve revolutionized the look and feel of our beauty product transitions to improve the environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in specially trained employees who will be available to provide advice on the spot.
Our brand offering is designed to suit every need and our attractive environment and convenient locations make us an attractive destination for purchasing beauty products, challenging the old ways of shopping.”
Peter Jones Angry After Holly Willoughby Cancels <0xC2><0xA3>11 Million Deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones has expressed outrage after TV host Holly Willoughby canceled an 11-million-pound deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
Actually, Wilabi doesn't have time for their housewear and accessories brand.
The couple's business is similar to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop.
The 37-year-old presenter of the show This Morning announced her departure in a post on Instagram.
Holly Wilabi left Dragons Den star Peter Jones furious by canceling at the last minute her participation in the prestigious lifestyle brand of the two – to focus on her fat contracts with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones reacted “angry” when the TV star announced during a turbulent meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that due to her new deals – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 – she had not had enough time to devote to their homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The joint venture was considered similar to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was expected to double Wilabi's fortune, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While 37-year-old Willaby posted on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones was on a flight from Britain to one of his vacation homes.
According to one source: “Truly was without a doubt Holly’s top priority.
This was supposed to be her long-term future that would provide her with income in the coming decades.
The decision to leave surprised everyone involved.
Nobody could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to launch.
The company’s warehouses in Marlowe are full of products ready for sale.”
Experts believe that leaving This Morning, one of the UK’s most lucrative stars, could cost the company millions as a result of massive investments in a variety of products, from pillows and candles to household clothes, and the potential for further delay in launch.
And that could lead to the end of a long friendship.
Willaby, who is a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willaby founded True with Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined the company’s chairmanship in March.
The couple have been on vacation together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin’s television production company.
Willabi will become the ambassador of the M<0x26>S brand and replace Annette McPartlin as a presenter on ITV's I'm A Celebrity show.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We are not responding to his business affairs.”
It was a tough conversation, and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he received from the news media about statements that some described as “non-presidential” and that he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump make so many concessions?
Trump said in a “news reporter” voice.
“I didn’t make any concessions.”
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after praising their first meeting in June as a major step toward North Korea’s denuclearization.
But negotiations on denuclearization have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a “responsive response” from the United States to North Korea’s initial disarmament measures.
Instead, he said, the U.S. is continuing with sanctions designed to maintain the pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his speech at the rally.
“We are in a very good position with North Korea,” he said.
“We almost went to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results — stopping missile tests, helping to free captives and bringing home the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual attitude about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this full stadium, we had about 200 people standing there,” Trump said, pointing right in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia have destroyed an island and killed hundreds of people.
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has lost their homes, no national disaster has been declared, which is a condition for accelerating international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they were not asking for international assistance, so it’s a bit of a challenge,” Ms. Soombong said.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear if foreign envoys will be able to cross the border.
Mr Sotopo, a spokesman for the National Disasters Agency, said the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international services could contribute to the relief effort.
In light of the earthquakes that are constantly occurring in Indonesia, the country remains unfortunately not prepared enough for natural disasters.
While tsunami shelters were built in Aceh province, they are rare in other coastal areas.
It is likely that the apparent lack of warning alarms about the Palu tsunami, although there is a warning, contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best of times, traveling between the many islands of Indonesia is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship sheltering in Lombok to care for earthquake victims is on its way to Palo, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster zone.
Improving Indonesia’s fragile infrastructure is at the center of President Joko Widodo’s campaign, and he has invested heavily in roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko is facing funding shortfalls ahead of his re-election bid next year.
Mr. Joko has also faced the pressure of ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia as a result of the process of religious radicalization of the country’s Muslim majority.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes in battles between Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets – using knives, bows and arrows and other domestic weapons.
Video: Liverpool’s Daniel Stride compares at the last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Stridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Stridge received a pass from Dardan Shaqiri when he was about 30 meters from the Chelsea gate and his team was 1-0 down.
He bounced the ball to his left and then turned a kick towards the far beam.
The ball flies high above the aisle and lands towards the upper right corner of the net.
Eventually the ball landed over the goalkeeper Capa Arisablga who jumped at him, and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to get to that position, to get to the ball and players like Shaq are always playing forward as much as possible, so I was just trying to create as much time for myself as possible,” Surridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante and I made one touch and I didn't think about it too much and I just kicked."
Chelsea led 1-0 in half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blue forward passed a pass back to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> in the same game, before turning near the middle of the field and running quickly into Liverpool's midfield.
Kovacic performed a quick give-and-go maneuver in the middle of the field.
And then he kicked a beautiful cross kick, which led the axer into the floor.
Hazard ran ahead of the defense and finished with the ball in the top right corner of the goal, with a left kick past Liverpool player Allison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami climbed to 832, the country's disaster agency said Sunday morning.
Many people have been reported trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed in Friday's 7.5 magnitude earthquake, causing waves up to 6 meters high, agency spokesman Sotopou Purvoy Naruheu said at a press conference.
The city of Palo, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered in rubble from collapsed buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
Police opened a murder investigation after a woman's body was found this morning in Bikinhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 a.m. on John Street for stabbing, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police are calling people from the area who have seen or heard something to address it.
Detective Superintendent Brian Ohgan said: “The investigation is in its infancy, but I would like to implore anyone near John Birkenhead Street who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
“I would also like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something on a car camera to contact us – because the footage may contain information that is essential to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman was found living in Birkenhead and that she was found inside a building.
Friends who believe they knew the woman came to the scene this afternoon to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are continuing as police say they are now in the process of delivering messages to relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews had just tried to enter his apartment, but was told that police were forbidding anyone to enter or leave the building.
He was shocked when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now told it will be hours before they are allowed to return to their apartments.
A cop sounds like he's telling one person that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman was seen in the scene tearing up.
She came back and said, “It’s terrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans were spotted inside the scene and another outside.
A number of police officers were standing inside the scene targeting people in the apartment building.
Anyone with information is requested to send a direct message on Twitter to <0x40>MerPolCC, dial 101, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and specify the diary number 247 dated September 30.
Cromwell’s Parliament Statue Became the Next Target for Attacks on Monuments in the Struggle for ‘Rewriting History’
The removal of the statue will be poetic justice in light of the removal of the ‘Taliban’ carried out by its puritan supporters to so many cultural and religious artefacts in England
But the Cromwell Society says Mr. Crick’s proposal is “stupid” and “trying to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that in the current dispute over the removal of statues, Oliver Cromwell’s image outside Westminster Palace would become a target.
The demolition of the statues of the Civil Wars in England was not carried out by Cromwell and was not carried out by him.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell falls victim to the actions of one of his predecessors in the line of Thomas Cromwell in the century before.
The impressive representation of Cromwell in the hands of the sculptor Sir William Hamo Thornicroft is a testament to a 19th-century view and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe deserves to be honored.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell was perceived by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than at present, as having defended Parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
The question of whether this is a fully accurate assessment is the subject of ongoing historical controversy.
The indisputable fact is that the struggle in the middle of the 17th century shaped the development of our nation later on, and Cromwell is one identifiable figure representing one side of the barricade at the time.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of honor and commemoration.”
Pig kills Chinese farmer to death
Local media sources report that a pig attacked a farmer in a market in southwest China.
The man, identified as Yuan, was found dead with a ruptured artery covered in blood near the pigsty at a market in Lufenshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A farmer is preparing to inject pig vaccines into a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xinning, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled Wednesday with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead and found a door to a nearby pigsty open.
He said there was a big male pig with blood on his mouth.
A criminal investigation has confirmed that the 250-pound pig attacked the farmer to death, according to the report.
“My uncle’s legs were full of blood and shattered,” the cousin whose last name “wow” was quoted in Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Ewan entering the market on Thursday morning at 4.40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked behind bars to prevent it from attacking more people as police gathered evidence at the scene.
It was reported that Yuan's family was in negotiations with the market authorities about compensation for his death.
Although rare, there have been reports of pigs attacking humans in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing a man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig had tied a farmer in Wales to his tractor until the farmer's wife smuggled the animal out.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, one Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but that the taste of blood may be a “trigger.”
“They’re just playing.
They're like naughty kids, very inquisitive... They don't mean to hurt you.
You just have to give them the respect they deserve,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rains in large areas of the southwestern United States.
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters on the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
However, Hurricane Rosa will bring flooding throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. over the next few days.
The winds in the Rosa storm reached a speed of 135 km/h, that is, a Category 1 hurricane, and as of Sunday at 5 a.m. East Coast time, the focus of the storm was 620 km southeast of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a canal is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean moving east towards the eastern coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push deep tropical humidity north into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 millimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
After that, tropical moisture combined with the approaching canyon will generate heavy rainfall in large areas of the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Locally, 25 to 100 millimeters of rain will cause flash floods and risk landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rainfall to reach 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 50 to 100 mm is expected in parts of the Southwest, especially Arizona.
There may be flash floods with conditions rapidly deteriorating due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain.
It is highly recommended to avoid walking long distances in the desert when there is danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into raging rivers and thunderstorms will bring strong blowing winds and dust storms.
The approaching canal will bring local rainfall to parts of the Southern California coastline.
There may be total rainfall of more than 13 mm, which could result in debris drift and smooth roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the region during this rainy season.
Scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, and the rain will intensify and spread later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the four corners on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
In October, there may be sharp temperature changes across the U.S., while the Arctic is cooling off, but the tropics remain fairly warm.
This often leads to dramatic changes in temperature between short distances.
On Sunday there is an excellent example of extreme temperature changes across the center of the United States.
There are temperature differences of almost 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the following days, prolonged summer heat will try to develop and expand again.
At the beginning of October, temperatures will be warm in most of the central and eastern regions of the United States, ranging from 27-31 degrees from the southern plains to the northeast.
In New York City, the temperature could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 5 degrees above average.
Long-term weather forecasts show high chances of above-average temperatures in the eastern U.S. in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday, on six television networks, the fascinating testimony of Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh, and the woman who accused him of alleged sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political debate continues, with news feeds in the middle of regular broadcasts to announce a surprising development on Friday: an agreement drafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI will conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Cavanaugh had touched her body while he was drunk and tried to undress her during a high school student party.
Kavanaugh, in passionate testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it didn’t happen.
It is likely that the number of viewers was even higher than the report of 20.4 million viewers according to the Nielsen Index.
Nielsen tested the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data was not immediately available for other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has a hard time measuring people watching in offices.
By comparison, this is an audience on a scale similar to that of the football playoffs or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose commentators enthusiastically support Cavanaugh’s appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing.
ABC came in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen reported.
The interest level remained high after the hearing.
Senator Flake was the main character in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican senator’s office issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Cavanaugh’s appointment, he was photographed by CNN and CBS photographers as a group of protesters yelled at him as he tried to get into the elevator to get to a hearing on the legal committee.
He stood with a humiliated gaze for several minutes as the protesters scolded him, all of which were filmed live on CNN.
“I’m standing here in front of you,” said one of the women.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the nation?
He was told, “You have power while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closed, that he would say more at the hearing.
The cable and radio networks all broadcast live a few hours later, when the legal committee was about to vote on Cavanaugh's nomination for the Senate vote.
But Flake said he would vote for the nomination only on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the candidate next week, which were demanded by members of the Democratic minority.
Flake was partially persuaded by conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Koons.
After a conversation with Koons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had power because it was clear that Republicans would not have a majority to approve Kavanaugh's appointment without investigation.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of 'playing politics' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “playing politics” with Britain’s future and harming the national internet in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview that appeared alongside the idea on the front page of the paper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson went on to attack her Brexit ‘gambling’ plan, saying that the proposal that Britain and the European Union would back each other up their tariffs was “absolutely unfounded.”
Wade Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Deaton Simpson as Suspect in LSU Actor Murder
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who played for the LSU team.
A 20-year-old man named Deaton Simpson has been arrested and imprisoned for first-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Simms and Simpson, and according to police, Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said Simpson's DNA was found on them, according to a report by WAFB, which is part of the CBS network.
After Simpson's interrogation, according to police, he confessed to shooting Wade to death.
The guarantee fee was set at $350,000, as reported by Advocate.
The Eastern Baton Rouge Pathology Institute released an initial report on Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and to the neck.
Police have given credit to the Louisiana State Police Task Force for the capture of fugitives, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, Southern University Police and citizens in the area who assisted in an investigation that led to the capture of the suspect.
The director of athletics at LSU, Joe Alva, thanked law enforcement in the region for “the diligence and pursuit of justice.”
Simms was 20.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
“That’s what we’re afraid of all the time,” Wade said.
A volcano emits ash over Mexico City
Ash emitted from the Fupocateptal volcano reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity in the mountain crater increased, with 183 emissions of gas and ash over a 24-hour period.
In the center, a number of noises and tremors were observed.
Pictures on social media showed thin layers of ash covering on windshields of cars in neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Sochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed increased activity on the volcano, located 72 km (45 miles) southeast of the capital, since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists as anniversary of independence vote nears
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence demonstrators clashed with police forces to disperse demonstrations, while thousands joined anti-protests to mark the first anniversary of the party’s vote for Catalan independence.
A group of masked separatists who were stopped by the police to disperse demonstrations, threw eggs at the policemen and spread powdered paint to create black clouds of dust on the streets that usually ravaged tourists.
Clashes also broke out later that day when police were forced to use batons to overcome the protesters.
For several hours, pro-independence groups who sang “Not to be forgotten, not to be forgiven” stood up to supporters of unity who called “Long live Spain.”
Local newspapers reported that 14 people were treated for minor injuries sustained by the protesters.
Tensions remained high in pro-independence areas a year after the October 1 referendum was judged illegal by the Spanish government, but celebrated by pro-independence Catalans.
Voters voted by a large majority to become an independent state, although the turnout was low when those who opposed secession by a majority boycotted the vote.
Authorities in Catalonia said nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop polling from taking place in polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups set up overnight camps on Friday to prevent a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to go a different route.
Narcisse Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he had lost hope about Catalonia's chances of independence.
Last year we had our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy that they could vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Although Catalonia’s separatist parties won an important, albeit narrow, victory in last December’s election, they have struggled to maintain momentum this year as many of their best-known leaders are either in voluntary exile or in prison awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Juan Foig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the police demonstration in support of his phone, said the conflict was being fueled by politicians on both sides of the conflict.
“It’s getting worse and worse,” he said.
On Saturday, Oryol Junkers, one of nine Catalan leaders in jail pending trial since late last year, announced he would run for European Parliament next year.
“Standing up as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we have witnessed from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Several men arrested after car rammed into house
Three men - aged 33.34 and 39 - were arrested after a car rammed into a house in Londonderry several times.
The incident took place in Blengarg Crescent on Thursday at around 7:30 p.m.
Detective detective Bob Bloomings said there was damage to the gates as well as to the building itself.
It is also possible that at some point an arrow was fired from a bow towards the car.
Manga kick gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Manga's first goal for Livingstone secured victory
Livingston, who just made it into the league, stunned Rangers and coach Steven Gerrard, which was only his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Abrux Club.
Dolly Manga's kick meant a lot because Gary Holt's team moved level with Hibernian in second place.
Gerard's team is left without a home win in the Premier League this season, and will face the lead Harts, behind which she is eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston extends the no-loss streak at home for six games, and head coach Holt has not experienced a break since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed a chance against a weak host
Holt's team was supposed to lead long before they captured a goal, when their directness caused Rangers various problems.
Scott Robinson burst forward but dragged his attempts ahead of a goal, and then Allan Lithgoy could only focus his efforts laterally after slipping in to meet Craig Helgett’s butt before the goal.
The hosts were willing to let the Ranger play in front of them, knowing that they could make it harder for the team to take free kicks.
And that's how the crucial gate came about.
The Rangers took a free kick and Livingstone created an opening, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined forces to block Manga, who made a touch and scored a goal from the center of the expansion.
At this point, the Rangers controlled possession of the ball but discovered that the house's defense was impenetrable, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly remained almost unintimidated.
This pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos did force Kelly to save the goal.
Scott Putnam was stunned by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor and Lithgow touched another free kicking ball from Livingstone.
Crossbows continued to enter Livingston's court and brake, while two penalty balls—after a foul by the collector for replacement Glen Middleton, and one for a hand-to-hand touch—were removed.
"Amazing" from Livingston - Analysis
Alastair Lamont, BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
Amazing game and amazing result from Livingston.
All the players were excellent, and continued to exceed expectations in this upward momentum.
Their style of play and the manoeuvre of the players have hardly changed since their return to the leading position, but much credit must be given to Holt for the way he has shaped the team since his arrival.
He had so many stars.
Captain Hollett was tremendous, leading a remarkably organised defense, while Manga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Wrall on high alert all the way.
But the Rangers were uninspired.
Although they were quite good at times under Jarrar, they did not meet these standards.
They were missing the final ball – only once they opened the home team’s defense – and that was a red light for the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the field.
Mixed reception for Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met on Saturday for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at repairing relations between the two NATO allies.
They were divided on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s admission to the European Union.
From there, Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an continued for Cologne to participate in the opening of a new huge mosque.
Cologne has the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
Police have announced security reasons to block 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters have gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, have also spoken out, protesting both Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s policies and Germany’s decision to welcome him to the country.
The opposing demonstrators reflect the controversy surrounding the guest that some Turks in Germany praise him as a hero and others condemn him as a tyrant.
Car crash in Deptford: cyclist killed in car crash
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Westwood and Evelyn Streets, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at around 10:15 p.m.
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics took care of the injured man, but the man died on the spot.
The collision came after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run on Childer Street, about a mile from the scene of Saturday’s accident.
Police say they are trying to identify the victim and notify his family.
Instead of checkpoints and buses being turned on alternate routes, drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Prisoners Wounded in Riot
Six guards were injured in a riot in a secure men’s prison, the prison’s office said.
The riot broke out at Long Lartin Prison in Westershire on Sunday at around 9:30 p.m., and it continues.
Special officers from a tornado unit were brought to the scene to eliminate the riot, which included eight prisoners and was contained to one wing.
Guards were treated at the scene for minor injuries to the face.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “Specially trained guards have been recruited to deal with an ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six guards were treated for injuries.
We do not accept violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those involved will be handed over to the police and their prison sentences may be extended.”
Long Lertin Prison houses 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison governor had received treatment in a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot police were called to the prison to deal with a serious riot in which guards were attacked with snooker sticks.
Hurricane Rosa threatens flash floods in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (drought areas may benefit)
It’s rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s expected to happen early next week, when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa will cross the desert in the southeast and bring with them the danger of flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already declared a flash flood hazard on Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona into southeastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The storm is expected to cross a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday and approach late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that “Ten tropical cyclones have remained in the status of a tropical storm or tropical depression within 322 kilometers of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 60 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the Arizona Hurricane Center predict 50 to 100 millimeters of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 150 millimeters on the edge of Arizona's Mogulon.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are expected to receive 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated places receiving a total of 50 mm.
For those outside the flash flood risk zone, the Rosa storm rain may be a blessing as the area has been suffering from drought.
Although floods are a serious danger, some of these rains will be helpful because the southwest is currently suffering from drought conditions.
“According to the U.S. drought surveillance, over 40 percent of Arizona is in severe drought, which is the second most severe category,” Weather.com reported.
First, the trajectory of Hurricane Rosa will reach land across the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa storm, which is still in hurricane strength on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at about 20 km/h.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, and thus weakens.
It is therefore expected to land in Mexico at the intensity of a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening of Monday.
Rains across parts of Mexico can be heavy and cause severe flooding.
“A total of 75 to 150 millimeters of rain is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with a chance of up to 250 millimeters,” Weather.com reports.
Rosa will then continue into Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then continue across Arizona into southern Utah on Tuesday night.
“The main danger that is expected from the Rosa storm, or its remnants, is heavy rainfall in Baja California, southwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert in the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause flash floods and life-threatening waste streams in the desert, and landslides in the mountainous regions.
Assault on Midsummer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in Midsomer Norton's Excelsior Terrace on Sunday at around 4:00 p.m.
He was taken to the hospital where he remained in stable condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the area of Radstock, Avon and Somerset, according to police.
The police are asking anyone who may have cell phone footage of what happened to contact the police.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'suffered the convictions and anger' of the Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party’s rudeness and shocking tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “tolerated the convictions, the anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Cavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, vehemently denying Kristin Blasey Ford’s accusation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at a hearing about her accusation.
The president said on Saturday that “the people of the United States saw the brilliance, quality and courage” of Kavanaugh that day.
“A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh’s appointment is a vote to confirm the appointment of one of the finest legal minds of our time, a man of law with an excellent record of public service,” he told supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly addressed Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of Republicans voting in midterm elections.
“Five weeks to one of the most important votes of our lives.
“I’m not a candidate, but I’m actually a candidate,” he said.
“That’s why I’m running everywhere to fight for great candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats were on a mission to “resist and interfere.”
A senior Republican aide told CNN that the first major procedural vote in the Senate plenary on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday.
Hundreds Killed in Indonesia Earthquake and Tsunami, Number Rises
At least 384 people were killed, many of them swept away by massive waves and crashed on the coast when a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia's Sulawesi island, officials said on Saturday.
Many people gathered for a beach festival in Palo City on Friday, when waves of 6 meters (18 feet) high crashed on the beach at sunset, sweeping many to their deaths and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami was triggered by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“When the tsunami threat came up yesterday, people were still busy on the beach and did not immediately flee, and they fell victim,” Sotopo Foro Noroho, a spokesman for the BNPB disaster management agency, said in a briefing in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on the ground,” Nuruh said, adding that the tsunami had advanced over the open sea at 800km (497 miles per hour) before hitting the coastline.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and they survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palo.
Aerial footage released by the disaster agency showed the destruction of a large number of homes and shops, curved bridges and courses, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Subsequent shocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Agency for Technology Assessment and Implementation (BPPT) said the energy released in Friday’s powerful quake was 200 times greater than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
According to him, the geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Noroho described the destruction as "huge" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Noroho said the death toll and damage could be greater along North Palo with a 300-kilometer (190-mile) coastline, an area called Dongla, and closer to the epicentre of the quake.
The media “completely collapsed and there is no information” from Dongala, Nuruh said.
More than 300,000 people live in the area," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its personnel and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for failing to announce that a tsunami had hit Palo, although officials said the waves arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video posted on social media, you can see a man on the high roof of a building shouting hysterical warnings about the tsunami approaching people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water crashes on the beach, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters was not immediately able to confirm that the photo was authentic.
The earthquake and tsunami caused widespread power outages that cut communications around Palo and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending transport planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, but the survivors are still in desperate need of food and other essentials.
The city’s airport is only open for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the rescue centers in Palo on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
It's very difficult.
While World Vision members from Dongala arrived safely in Palo City, where workers were sheltering in abrasive shelters set up in the courtyards of their offices, they passed mirrors of destruction on their way, Mr. Duceva said.
“They told me they saw many houses destroyed,” he said.
It's very difficult.
Even as aid groups began the unfortunate operations of propulsion of disaster aid, some complained that the Palo of experienced foreign aid workers had been denied access.
Under Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies, and people from other countries can only begin to flow if the affected area is declared a national disaster zone.
This thing hasn't been done yet.
“It’s still a regional disaster,” said Olia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“After the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we will be able to open the door to international aid, but that status has not yet been declared.”
As the second night fell on Palo after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of the missing held out hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that illuminate the grim stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been buried under rubble for two days, with her mother's body next to her.
Gandun Subandunu, coach of Indonesia's paragliding team, coached two missing paragliders ahead of the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others of those trapped in the hotel saw the seer, and among them Mr. Mandege, were his disciples.
“As a veteran of paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gandon recalls how in the hours after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel spread among the paratrooper community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palo, who took part in the beach festival.
However, his messages showed only one gray check mark, instead of a pair of blue ones.
“I think it means that the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Thieves Take $26,750 During ATM Filling at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from an ATM-filled Brinks employee at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver emptied an ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing to bring in more money, researcher Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While busy, another man “runs behind a Brinks employee” and steals a bag with money to fill at an ATM.
A witness saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but police did not specify how many people were involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identities should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The entity that used to be known as Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for some time and he used the nickname as the name of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces Ariana Grande, who has cancelled due to “emotional reasons,” the show’s creator said.
In addition to the abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible the word means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, when discussing the name of his album with radio broadcaster Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, that’s us.
It’s gone from Kanye, which means the one and only, to just ‘Ye’—just a reflection of the good in us, the bad in us, or the confused, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Coombs was known as Puff Daddy, Pee Daddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names “Love” and “Brotherly Love.”
West’s former partner, Jay-Z, also moved between versions of his name with and without a dash and capital letters.
Mexico president vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody crackdown on students.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised on Saturday in Teletolaco Square “never to use the army to oppress the Mexican people.”
Military forces fired on a nonviolent demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were beginning to develop throughout Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by providing financial support to those studying and opening more public universities for free.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are pushing young people into crime gangs.
The U.S. Should Double Artificial Intelligence Funding
As China ramps up its AI business, the U.S. needs to double the amount it invests in AI research, says AI researcher Kai Fo Li, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about artificial intelligence, even as the U.S. government does not have a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it aims to be No. 1 in artificial intelligence by 2030.
“Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the U.S., and we’re looking for the next AI breakthrough,” Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances that the next big AI achievement will be achieved in the United States, he told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in China’s most prominent AI company: Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that defeated the first-ranked Reversi player in the U.S., and later served as a senior executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google’s China branch.
Lee recognized previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the agency’s Advanced Research Projects Robotics Challenge, and asked when she would be next, to help identify the next visionaries.
U.S. researchers often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s taking us to the top researchers in academia, it’s the companies that are doing it,” Li said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited stars from universities to work in the field of artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think a green card should be offered automatically to those with a PhD in artificial intelligence,” he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China released its next-generation AI development plan.
The National Science Foundation of China grants funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute allowances to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a joint artificial intelligence center to engage industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the creation of a special committee for artificial intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an artificial intelligence initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, a U.S. legislative initiative to create a national security committee for artificial intelligence has been inactive for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change country’s name
On Sunday, Macedonians voted in a referendum on whether to change its name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has prevented it from joining the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbour's name is a claim to Greek territory and has vetoed its accession to NATO and the European Union.
The two countries signed a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but anti-nationalists say the change will hurt the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s Slavic majority population.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign cast doubt on whether the voter turnout would be at the minimum of 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot is: “Are you in favor of joining NATO and the European Union upon the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying so that Macedonia, one of the countries created by the dissolution of Yugoslavia, can join bodies such as the European Union and NATO.
“I came here today to point out the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live in freedom under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means a safe life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgeszewka, 79, in Skopje.
Although the popular vote is not legally binding, enough MPs have said they will abide by the results of the vote to make it a voter.
To change the name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no irregularities right at 1 p.m.
However, the voter turnout was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of eligible voters came to vote.
“I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Jose Tenevsky, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Ziv, his wife Zurika and his son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko are dropping their ballot in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018, in a referendum in Macedonia on the name change, which will open the door for accession to NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament house in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kawarderkov prepared a small stage and chairs in front of tents set up by those boycotting the referendum.
“We are in favor of NATO and the European Union, but we want to join with an upright head, not through the entrance of the servants,” Kawardrakov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have respect.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian Union.”
Prime Minister Zeev said NATO members would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 percent.
“I believe the vast majority would be in favor of more than 80 percent of our citizens supporting the European Union and NATO,” Zaev said after voting.
He said a positive outcome would be “security for our future.”
A survey published Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will take part in the referendum – less than the required percentage of turnout.
Another poll, conducted by the Macedonian television network Telma TV, found that 57 of the respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to succeed, the percentage of voters must be at least 50 percent plus one.
The vote's failure will be the first major loss of pro-Western government policy since it seized power in May last year.
Video: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero navigates through all of Brighton’s defense to score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling broke Brighton’s defense in a 2-0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday at Itihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It looked like Aguero was taking the gate lightly.
The Argentine pioneer received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defensive players, before breaking into the open field.
At this point, Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed around one shield before running for a few more on Brighton's expansive border.
And then he kicked a pass to the left, and he found Sterling.
The English striker used his first touch in the field to deliver the ball back to Aguero, who in a right foot kick defeated Brighton's goalkeeper, Mateo Ryan, with a ball to the right side of the net.
“Aguaro has problems with his feet,” the manager of Manchester City told reporters.
“We agreed that he would play for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We’re lucky he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Contents the starting edge in rivalry in the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep inside Brighton during this.
He sent a great crossball along the right flank to Leroy Sanne.
Sanne dribbled the ball before leading Sterling towards the far beam.
The Blue Sky player pushed the ball into the net just before it slid off the field.
Manchester City will face Oppenheim at the Champions League home game on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhine-Neckar Stadium in Zinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer Wants to Play Spoiler Against the Rockies
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there was no good reason to force another start.
But Scherzer, who is very competitive, hopes to win on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still consequences for the playoffs for the Rockies, who lead one game against the L.A. Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies held at least one open-ticket spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but have yet to secure the first place at home.
“Although we are playing for nothing, at least we can be able to play with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver with the spectators and the second team will probably play at the highest level at every point I face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to deal with it?”
The Nationals have not yet announced the starter for Sunday, but they are reportedly inclined to let Sherzar serve in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will be his 34th start, coached Bolfan on Thursday and will serve on his day of rest - Sunday.
Washington's right-hand pitcher has an 18-7 record with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikes in 220 2/3 rounds of the season.
Trump held a rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly hinted at the situation around his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Cavanaugh, as he spoke of the importance of Republicans voting in midterm elections.
“Everything we did was at stake in November.
Five more weeks for the most important choices of our lives.
It’s one of the most, the most — I’m not running, but actually I’m running, and that’s why I’m running everywhere and fighting for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this horrible and horrible group of radical Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And if we are determined to take back power by any means necessary, you see the wickedness, the despicableness.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control, that’s what they want is power and control, we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to “resist and interfere.”
“And you’ve seen it over the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry and mean and mean and dishonest.”
He mentioned on her behalf the minority leader on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, which drew loud scorn from the crowd.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I waited until — that was really bad body language — the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a pluralist place.
She's intolerant of those who express their opinions.
When momentum activists at my local party branch voted to censor me, it wasn’t really a surprise.
After all, I’m the last in a line of Labour MPs to be told they’re not welcome — and only because we’ve expressed our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated the same because she stood up strongly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the decision to censor me criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, for Europe – ironically, issues similar to those for which Jeremy disagreed with previous party leaders.
The committee on the East Nottingham Liver Party meeting on Friday said: “We want the meeting to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the General Committee meetings on Friday evenings were exactly the same.
To the extent that this is the case today, it is not the tone of many of the meetings and the promise of a “kinder, gentler” politics has long been forgotten, if ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the Labour Party has no tolerance for different views, and every opinion is judged on the basis that it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
This situation began shortly after Jeremy was elected party leader, when colleagues who in the past thought we shared a similar political view began to expect him to make a U-turn and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed to—whether on national security or on a single European market.
Whenever I speak in public — and it doesn’t really matter what I say — immediately comes an abusive flood of social media harassment with calls for impeachment, condemnation of the center’s politics and calls that I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I’m luckier than many of my colleagues, because the comments they make to me tend to be political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a flurry of racist abuse every day but never back down.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how levels of abuse have become routine.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are already in the same pluralistic place, and with every decision to “distrust” or change the rules of the election, the party becomes narrower.
Over the past two years, many have advised me to keep my mouth shut, not to be so loud, and then I’ll be fine.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, irritated by the Thatcher government’s neglect that has caused my public school class to almost fall apart, I’ve been looking for how to fight for better social services for those who need them most – whether as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I've never concealed my political views, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could in any way be confused as to my political positions and issues of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who pushed Friday’s decision, all I have to say is that while the country is crawling towards a Brexit that will hurt our families, our businesses and our public service, I don’t understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in truth, the one message I have is not for momentum in Nottingham, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats of impeachment or political utilitarianism will deter me from acting in a way that I believe serves the best interests of all of you.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: The undefeated Air to the Top
The last two freshmen have slightly tilted the final score, but Air is certainly worthy of a victory in today's wonderfully entertaining Scottish Premier League game.
They are now at the top of the table, the only undefeated side of the teen.
In the end, it was their better defense, as well as the much more risk-taking, playing for the home team, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested in our games so far, and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robin Christie of the Melrose Group said: “Air deserves all the credit, they took better risks than we did.”
Grant Anderson’s Trey in the 14th minute, who was bet by Fraser Climo, put Air in the lead, but a yellow card for Scotland player Rory Hughes released for the game by the Warriors allowed Melrose to score points and Jason Baggott caught Trey not bet.
Klimo raised Air's lead with a foul, just before halftime, he scored and then converted Trey Solo to get 17-5 for Air in halftime.
But Melrose opened the second half well and the freshman Patrick Angerson, who had been converted by Bogot, narrowed the gap to five points.
There was then a long delay due to a serious injury of Roderick Knut, who was taken away on a gurney, and starting from the rejuvenation of the game, Air increased the gap through Trey of Stafford McDowell, who was converted by Climo.
Air Blair McPherson's lieutenant then took a yellow card, and Melrose again took advantage of the other man with Bruce Colvin's undefeated Trey, ending a streak of tremendous pressure.
But the home team recovered, and when Strawn Hutchinson got a yellow card for attacking Climo without a bullet, from the penalty line, McPherson scored a touchdown behind Air’s advanced mole.
Climo converted, as he did almost again from returning to the game, after Kyle Roy S. kicked David Armstrong's boxing and sent the Henry Gragger wing to the sixth Trey of the home team.
Star of Still Game looks ready for new restaurant career
Still Game star Ford Kiernan appears to be ready to move into the restaurant industry after it was revealed that he was named the manager of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he writes and stars along with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the final season of the show, and Kieran seems to be planning life after Cryling.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan was looking for ways to get into the thriving restaurant business in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': Bolivia's inexhaustible sea hopes court will open a path to the Pacific
Sailors patrolling the naval headquarters in a cloak of ships in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a blue-sea flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon carry the slogan: “The sea is ours by right.
It is our duty to bring him back.”
Throughout Bolivia’s inhospitable sea, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody confrontation over resources in the 19th century is still alive – as is the longing to sail again in the Pacific.
Those hopes may be at their peak for decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and of course it expects a positive attitude for the future,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will condemn the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, hoping that the Court in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia’s demand that after decades of intermittent talks, Chile be obliged to negotiate the granting of sovereign access to the sea to Bolivia.
Bolivia’s charismatic, native-born president, Evo Morales, who faces a contentious fight for re-election next year, is weighing heavily on Monday’s decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
But commentators say there is little chance that the court will decide in Bolivia’s favor—and that even if it does, it won’t change much.
The UN court in The Hague has no authority to grant Chile territory, and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice came only six weeks after the hearing of the concluding arguments indicates that the case was “not complicated,” but Paz Zarata, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of promoting Bolivia’s claims, it may even be that the last four years have weakened them.
“The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian government,” Zarata said.
Morales’ warlike rhetoric wiped out every remnant of goodwill on Chile’s part, she said.
“Sometimes Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but it will be very difficult to have discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodriguez Velza, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court decision was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will have a “great opportunity to usher in a new era in relations with Chile” and the chance to “end 139 years of disputes for the benefit of both sides,” he said.
Kalzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, is using the maritime issue as a political lever.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“Section is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past.”
North Korea Says Nuclear Damage Dismantling Won't Happen Unless It Can Trust the U.S.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong, said his country would never disarm first if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises it made during the summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears on the verge of reopening diplomatic talks on nuclear weapons, which have reached a dead end more than three months after a summit in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ree said it was a "dream in assemblage" to think that continued U.S. sanctions and resistance to declare the end of the Korean War would force North Korea to kneel.
The United States is afraid of agreeing to a declaration without North Korea first taking meaningful steps to denuclearize.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump are interested in a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that North Korea is serious about giving up its nuclear arsenal, which it likely sees as the only way to protect its own security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
A fashion show in Paris reveals the new trend in giant hats found on its way to luxury stores everywhere
The solution is for anyone who wants to expand their hat collection or get total protection from the sun.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown unveiled a series of huge, crazy headgear for their SS19 collection at a fashion show that stunned the fashion scene at Paris Fashion Week.
Clearly impractical hats occupied Instagram this summer, and these designers brought their extraordinary creations to the fashion show track.
Valentino’s most notable item was an oversized beige hat decorated with wide feather-like edges that covered the models’ heads.
Other accessories of demilitarized size included decorated watermelons, a magic hat and even pineapple - but they were not designed to protect the head from the cold.
Tom Brown also revealed a selection of strange masks – check in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks included sewn lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than Hot Couture.
One piece mentioned a diving mask including snorkeling and glasses, and another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And for those who want to continue with a great fashion statement – their time has come.
Fashion commentators predict that the giant hats are making their way to luxury stores everywhere.
The giant hats are the next hit after ‘La Bomba’, the straw hat with a half-meter-wide fringe seen on everyone’s head, from Mariana to Emily Ratajkowski.
The clutch label behind the very impractical hat that flooded the social networks gave rise to another large piece on the runway – a keyboard sea bag almost as big as the swimsuit model that carried it.
A burned-out colored relaxing bag, with the hem of loose locks and a white leather handle, was the highlight of Jacqueline Le Riviera’s SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I’m anticipating that big hats and big purses will be coming to the high-end stores next summer – because the design has made a huge impression and it will be hard to ignore the demand for extra-sized accessories.”
John Edwards: Language skills are essential for the world’s citizens
The independent schools in Scotland maintain a track record of academic excellence, and this continues in 2018 with another set of outstanding test results, reinforced by individual and group success in sport, art, music and other areas of the community.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aspire to prepare their students for further and higher education, for the careers they choose and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector that is able to design and implement a customized curriculum, we find that modern languages continue to gain popularity as a desired field of study in school.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it goes into his head.
When you speak to a man in his own language, it goes into his heart.”
It’s an important reminder that we can’t rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of the last tests this year, you can see that languages are at the top of the charts with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a high A score.
Data collected from 74 schools that were members of SCIS showed that 72 percent of students achieved a high A score in Mandarin, as did 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish.
These figures show that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and adolescents will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today the field of languages as a subject of choice is considered at the same level as STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the British Council on Employment and Skills found that among the reasons employers cited Cody for filling vacancies, 17 percent were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Thus, to an increasing degree, language skills become an essential need to prepare students for future careers.
Given the rising demands for languages for future job opportunities, these skills are essential in the world of globalization.
No matter what career a person chooses, if they learn a second language, they will have a significant advantage in the future thanks to this lifelong ability.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically stabilizes a person in an advantageous position over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language at a level sufficient to have a conversation, and French was the only language with a two-digit number of speakers, 15 percent.
That’s why it’s important to invest today in teaching children languages.
Knowledge of many languages, especially those of developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
Within Scotland, each school will be different in terms of the languages it is taught.
Some schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will learn languages that are considered most important for Britain looking ahead to the 1920s, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever the child’s area of interest, there will always be a variety of languages to choose from in the independent schools, with a team of teachers specializing in the field.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed in any foreseeable future.
It cannot be denied today, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be of vital importance for the future of the country, so this fact should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be seen as “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer these levels of choice, diversity and excellence to the children of Scotland.
That's the order of the hour.
John Edwards is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron is expected to play for the Lakers for the first time on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is over for fans waiting to see LeBron James play for the first time in the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play a pre-season game against Denver Nagas on Sunday in San Diego.
It is not yet clear how many minutes he will play.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” the official Lakers website said.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would likely play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six pre-season Lakers.
“At this stage in my career I don’t need pre-season games to prepare,” he said.
Trump rally hour in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is opening a flurry of rallies tonight in Willing, Virginia.
It is the first of five planned Trump rallies this week, including stops in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While you’ve voted to appoint a Supreme Court justice, Trump is seeking to build support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Willing, West Virginia, is scheduled to start at 19:00 Eastern Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump rally in West Virginia live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to refer to this week’s Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh’s hearings, which have become tense over sexual misconduct allegations and the subsequent postponement of the Senate vote a week as the FBI investigates the allegations.
But the main goal of this rallies is to help Republicans facing a challenging election in November get some momentum.
Therefore, President Trump’s campaign said that the goal of these five rallies next week is to “encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congressional control is so critical to his agenda that the president is willing to visit as many countries as possible as he enters the tight election season,” he told Reuters, a Trump campaign spokesman who asked to remain anonymous.
Tonight’s rally, which is planned to take place at Wesbanko Stadium in Welling, could bring in supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and pull press coverage from the Pittsburgh media,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the country he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is behind in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrissey that the president needs to come to try to improve his situation in the polls,” said Simon Haider, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows willingness to fight to keep hope alive for Sunday’s singles games
After three one-sided sessions, the Sunday afternoon quartet games may be exactly what the Ryder Cup needs.
Momentum’s propulsion pendulum is a completely invented sport concept, but the players really believe in it, and never more so than in competitions like this one.
So where do they think the momentum is now?
“They had a six-point lead and now it’s four, so you can see a bit of momentum,” Jorn Spit said at the end of the day.
Europe is ahead, four points ahead, with 12 more in the game.
But the Americans, as Spit says, feel they have a bit of wind in the sails, and they have a lot to cheer up about, not the last of them in the form of Spit, and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each boasts three points out of four.
Spit was lethal from the green tee to the green, and he is a leader by personal example.
The cries of joy grew stronger as his round went on, as he dunked a critical pat to win a four-square game and Thomas dropped two after two.
His pat, who won the 15on game, won a similar cry, the kind that shows he believes the American team still has hope.
“You really just have to dig deep and worry about your own game,” Spit said.
That’s all the players have to do.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only actors with more points than Smith and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed lead story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe’s strange, yet charming duo are four out of four and win everyone’s sympathy.
"Molywood" was the only duo that didn't hit the bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon and at 9 a.m. on Friday morning.
The same round, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the enthusiastic crowd, establishes that they are the players who will win on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to sign the potential European victory with the sun setting on the Le Golf National golf course.
Better both at the same time in different niches.
However, it is too early to talk about European fame.
Boba and Tucson Webb Simpson ended up with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning’s four balls, when he was robbed with Alex Norén.
Bogey and two doubles in the front nine lowered the Spaniards and Swedes into a hole they never came close to exiting.
However, on Sunday there is no one to help you out of the hole.
It’s fascinating to look closely at the four balls and the quadrants because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and is leading significantly towards the last day, but this fourth session showed that the American team is full of fighting spirit that some, especially inside the United States, have questioned.
Europe leads 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe is in a healthy lead for the last day of the Ryder Cup after finishing the four-ball and four-round games on Saturday with a 10-6 result against the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Wortzko Molinari led the change with two victories over struggling Tiger Woods, raising the gap so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn’s European side, who tried to defend the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the Americans who missed the four-ball games this morning, bringing the series to 3-1.
The American players showed more resistance in the quartet games, winning two games, but were unable to close the gap.
To keep the trophy, Jim Forik’s friends need eight points out of the 12 individual games.
Fleetwood is the first European Tirocan to win four points in a row, while he and Molineri, nicknamed "Molywood" after an outstanding weekend, are only the second pair to win four points from their four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the Four-Ball Games, they went on in splendid harmony to defeat weakened Woods and American rookie Bryson Dashmbauh with an even more conspicuous score of 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged himself across two games on Saturday, showed random bursts of excellence, but so far he has lost 19 of the 29 games of the four balls and fours, and seven games in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning’s four-ball games, returned to join Henrik Stanson in the quartet games to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Coppa, who are ranked first and third in the world.
However, not everything went easily for European players in the pleasant weather and mild wind blowing southwest of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set the bar for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a 2 and 1 win over John Ram of Spain and Ian Falter in the four-ball games and later returned to defeat Falter and Rory McLeroy 4 and 3 in the four-way games, having lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup team returned from a negative four-point gap to the individual games, although as Cup holders, Forik's people only need a tie to keep the Cup.
However, after being in second place for two days, Sunday’s counteroffensive seems to be beyond their means.
North Korea says ‘under no circumstances’ it will unilaterally disarm without trust
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday at the United Nations that continued sanctions were deepening its distrust of the United States and there was no chance the country would unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under the circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho announced at the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken “substantial goodwill measures” in the past year, such as halting nuclear missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and a commitment not to develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“But we don’t see any consistent response from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, we cannot be sure of our national defense and under such conditions we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
While Cheri has repeated North Korea’s well-known complaints about U.S. opposition to a “ranked” approach to nuclear disarmament that North Korea will be rewarded while taking step-by-step steps, his statement appears to be important in that it has not rejected nuclear disarmament, as North Korea has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint announcement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit in history between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to work toward “nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula” while Trump promised to defend North Korea’s security.
North Korea sought an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said North Korea must first give up its nuclear weapons.
The United States also opposed calls to reduce international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘nuclear disarmament first,’ and increases the pressure of sanctions to achieve its goal by means of coercion, even opposing the ‘declaration of the end of the war,’” Ree said.
“The perception that sanctions can make us kneel down is a dream in the assemblage of people who are ignorant about us.
But the problem is that the harsher sanctions deepen our distrust.”
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. president emphasized in his speech to the United Nations earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: “If the other side to the nuclear disarmament issue was South Korea and not the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a dead end.”
However, Ri’s tone was dramatically different from last year’s, when he told the UN General Assembly that an attack on U.S. soil with North Korea’s missiles was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened "total destruction" of North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to denuclearize, but said there was still a lot of work to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea's denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a set time frame for that, adding that “whether it takes two years, three years or five months — it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia have argued that the U.N. Security Council should reward North Korea for its actions.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "the enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue with determination and unhindered until we achieve a complete and verified final nuclear disarmament."
The UN Security Council has unanimously supported the imposition of sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to block funding for its ballistic and nuclear missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the next summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his latest visit has not gone well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea condemned him for setting "gangster demands".
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site as well as a nuclear facility if the United States took “compatible steps.”
He said Kim told him that the “compatible steps” he wanted included security guarantees Trump had made in Singapore, as well as changes in the direction of normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year teaches participants how to sleep more, trying to fight off the expanding macho culture of learning by staying up all night with caffeine.
Academic research has found that students at the world’s number one university often have no idea when it comes to the basic principles of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Cassisler, a professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham <0x26> Wymans Hospital, designed the course, which he estimates is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to open the course after a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of the lecture, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why am I only being told this now, in my senior year?’
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told the Telegraph.
The course, which is delivered for the first time this year, explains to students the principles of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall condition.
Paul Breira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and senior director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to open the course after discovering that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive assignments.
Part one shows a picture of a dorm room, where students click on coffee mugs, curtains, sportswear and books - to get explanations about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, as well as the importance of a sleep-walking routine.
In another section, participants are told how persistent sleep deprivation can increase their risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus, with interactive symbols, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know it won’t change the behavior of students overnight.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes.”
He said the culture of pride over ‘sleepless night running’ still exists, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students are causing the problem of lack of sleep to grow.
Worrying about adequate sleep, and a good quality of sleep, should be every student’s ‘secret weapon’ to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said — even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep puts the brain to starvation, so we’re hungry all the time.
Raymond Sue, a 19-year-old California student studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Ziezler design the course after attending one of his first-year classes at Harvard.
He said the course enlightened him and motivated him to encourage a course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar teaching program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Ciezel advised students to look into setting a clock that would ring when it was time to go to sleep, not just when it was time to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitting electronic screens and LED lighting, which could disrupt the circadian rhythm and thus cause sleep problems.
Livingstone 1-0 Rangers: Manga’s goal is decisive for Gerard’s players
The Rangers suffered another defeat attack in an away game when Dolly Manga caused Stephen Gerrard's rebel players to defeat 1-0 at Livingston.
Ibrox players had hoped to win their first away game since the February 1-4 victory at St Johnston, but Gary Holt’s team only caused Gerard’s second loss in 18 games as manager and left the team eight points behind the racing Hearts at the top of the Scottish Premier League.
Manga attacked seven minutes before the half and the uninspired Rangers didn’t seem to match.
As the Rangers now drop to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third place and immediately behind Hibernian by a goal difference.
Another Rangers double may be waiting after Cowen Callum Spence needed treatment for a head injury after an object was apparently thrown at him from the stands.
Gerard made eight exchanges for the team that passed Air to the semi-finals in the Cup at Teppard.
Holt, on the other hand, went up with those 11 Livingston players who took a point from the Harts last week, and he could have been pleased with how his players had stopped their opponents in any situation.
The Rangers may have controlled the ball, but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They almost caught up in the second minute when Manga sent a ball to Scott Patman who kicked Alan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder kicked the ball too far.
Then a deep free kick by Keegan Jacob found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defender Alan Lethgoy could only kick out of the beam.
The Rangers did take over, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he should have ruled in his favor after a quarter-hour match when he and Steven Loyles collided, but Judge Steven Thompson raised his hand against the Colombian actor’s pleas.
The Rangers only managed to kick twice to the goal in the first half, but Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily blocked LaSana Coulibaly’s butt and Obi Ajaria’s weak kick.
While Livingston’s opening at the 34th minute was at odds with the way the game was played, no one would deny that they deserved it at least for their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs’ deep free ball.
Scott Artfield did not respond while Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool by passing it to Manga for a simple finish.
Gerard did something in half when he replaced Colibelli with Ryan Kent, and the replacement had an almost immediate effect when the extreme/winger injected a bullet into Morelos but the impressive Kelly ran off his line to block.
But Livingston continued to force the visiting team to play exactly the kind of game she liked, with Leithgoy and the Collector continuing to send long balls.
Holt's team could have increased the lead in the other stages, but McGregor was well positioned to prevent Jacobs' attempt before Leigh got a badge from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton later had another claim against Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored it.
Almanac: Inventor of Geiger Count
And now stand from Sunday Morning's almanac: September 30, 1882, the day 136 years ago, and continue ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geyer developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as a Geiger counter.
Since then, the device has become a science pillar, but in 1950 it also became a pop culture pillar thanks to the film "Bells of Coronado," in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans starred as two strange cowboys/scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that thing?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter, which is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you put on the headphones, you can actually hear the effects of radioactivity on the atoms in the minerals."
Evans: “Oh, my God, it’s really popping right now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, shortly before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live after him.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells and eliminate them
Vaccination teaches the immune system to identify cancer cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, and changing the cells in the laboratory.
The cells can then “see” a protein that is shared by many cancers and then injected back into the patient.
An experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
In one woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to identify cancer cells, ovarian cancer has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, changing the cells in the lab so that they can “see” a protein called HER2 that is common to many cancers, and then injecting the cells back into the patient.
Professor Jay Barzofsky, from the National Cancer Institute of the United States in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “prevents the development of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, explained Prof. Barzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and “teaching” them how to attack cancer cells has been successful in treating a type of blood cancer.

Kanye West responded to booing calls at the studio during a confused performance on the Saturday Night Live, praising U.S. President Donald Trump and saying he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song on the show, entitled “Gust Town,” during which he wore a Make America Great hat, he cracked a reprimand speech against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“So many times I talk to white people who say, ‘How can you love Trump, he’s a racist?’
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL episode began with a sketch starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual assault brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the reproof speech was not aired on the show, it was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to roll on West in the trailer.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had been criticized behind the scenes for the hat he was wearing.
They attacked me behind the scenes.
They said, ‘Don’t go out on stage with that hat on your head.’
They attacked me!
Then they said I was in a dark place,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, “Do you want to see the dark place?” Saying that he was “wearing my Superman hat, because that means no one can tell me what to do. You want the world to move forward?
Try to show love.”
His comments were booed at least twice by the crowd, and members of the SNL team appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported, and one of them told the newspaper: “A deep silence fell through the entire studio.”
West was added to the show as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former partner, Mac Miller, had died days earlier.
West was shocked when he performed the song I Love It while dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was backed by the head of conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the bravest souls: Thank you for not giving in to the crowd."
But current program host Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West simply “was who he was and it’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But I chose not to reward (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’) that I think is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so do we,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now “the entity formerly known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Papi and P Didi.
Another rapper, Snoop Doc, had the name Snoop Lyon, and of course the famous musician Prince changed his name to Sergeant and then to an artist formerly known as Prince.
Man charged with attempted murder after stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
According to police, the incident took place in Blyakhamer.
The suspect is expected to appear in Belfast court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Keith Harrington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for playing the role of Jon Snow, the sword-wielder of the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old has attacked the macho stereotype, saying that such on-screen roles often convey to young children the message that they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he thought “something went wrong” and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married another star at Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted he was “very upset” about handling the issue.
“Personally, I’m very upset right now—where did we go wrong about masculinity?” he said.
“What are we teaching men in their growing up, from the point of view of the problem we are now witnessing?”
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for a rise in toxic masculinity, due to the very masculine characters she portrays.
He continued: “What comes from within and what we learn from without?
What can we learn from television and the street that makes young children feel like they have to be on this particular side of being a man?
I think that’s really one of the big questions of our time – how do we change that?
“Something has gone wrong for young men.”
In an interview, he admitted that he would not participate in any sequels or derivative series of Game of Thrones after the end of the series next summer, saying that he "ended with battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Keith will star in a remake of Sam Shepard’s play ‘True West’, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, the bandit.
The actor recently discovered that he saw meeting his wife Rose as the best thing that ever happened as a result of Game of Thrones.
“I knew my wife in the series, so in this way the series gave me my future family, and my life from that moment on,” he said.
Rose played the role of Jagritt, John Snow’s love interest, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The two married in June 2018 at the Leslie family mansion in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have the disease, health officials said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second half of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been infected as a result of sex, which is a change from the past.
To date, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, according to health officials in China at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV infection as a result of sex is a burning problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality ceased to be illegal in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be widespread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the cases of infection are the result of not using adequate protective measures in these sexual relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has ensured universal access to HIV drugs as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her team leaked information about a Republican senator and denounces “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
U.S. Senator Maxine Waters on Saturday rejected allegations that a member of her team posted personal information about three U.S. senators on the senators' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democratic Senator estimated that the allegations were spread by websites and “extremely right-wing” critics.
“Lies, lies, and more abominable lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
According to the reports, the information released included the residence addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a hearing before the Senate committee on sexual misconduct charges against Supreme Court Justice Barrett Cavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was linked to Waters’ office and published the information about a member of Waters’ staff, according to a Hill report.
“This baseless accusation is completely false and a complete lie,” Waters added.
“My team member – whose identity and personal details have been exposed and whose security has been compromised as a result of these false and erroneous allegations – was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This baseless accusation is completely false and a complete lie.”
Waters’ announcement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This is an angry denial,” Fleischer wrote.
“This indicates that it does not have the temperament required of members of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t react with anger.
He can't react defiantly.
He must not question the motives of the accuser.
He has to be calm and peaceful.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters’s response to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, which critics accused of looking too angry during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate trying to beat Waters in the midterms, also tweeted his thoughts.
“Great if that’s true,” he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said her office had “contacted the appropriate authorities and law enforcement about these false claims.
“We will make sure that the offenders are discovered,” she continued, “and that they are brought to justice for all their destructive and dangerous acts against my teammates.”
Johnny English 3.0: A Weakened Spy Parody starring Rowan Atkinson
It is now common to look for meanings about Brexit in any new film with a British perspective, and it does seem fitting for this revival of the action-comedy parody of the Johnny English series—which began somewhere in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English coming back.
Will an ironic self-slapping about how worthless we are become our country's new export opportunity?
In any case, the half-wit Johnny English with his wide-eyed, rubber-faced eyes got another chance to mess things up – and his name symbolizes more than anything that this is a wide-ranging comedy designed for moviegoers in non-English-speaking countries.
He is, of course, the stupid English agent, who despite his bizarre pretense of slippery glamour looks a bit like Clouseau, a little Mr. Bean and plenty of this guy who contributes a single note to the ride of fire in the opening text of the 2012 London Olympics.
It is also based on the mysterious international traveler played by Atkinson in the forgotten television commercials for Barclaycard, which leaves chaos behind.
There’s a nice minute or two in the last edition of Johnny English.
I loved the part where Johnny English approaches the helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the propeller blades ring for moments on his helmet.
Atkinson exhibits his comic physical abilities, but humor feels strangely weak and redundant, especially since the “serious” type of spy films like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now include a comic component.
The humor feels like it’s appealing to kids instead of adults, and to me, the crazy Johnny English adventures are less brilliant and focused than Mr. Bean’s silent Atkinson-style jokes.
The film begins when a great danger threatens Britain.
A hacker infiltrated the British spy's super-secret internet network, exposing the identities of all British agents on the ground to the chief agent's apprehension - a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for a prime minister who is arrogant and battle-ready, already suffering from a complete collapse of political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best to fill the Theresa May-like role, but she doesn’t have much to work with from the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy has been exposed, she will have to bring someone back from retirement.
And that means the self-proclaimed Johnny English, who is now employed as a school principal at a prestigious institution, but gives informal lessons on how to be an undercover spy: some good jokes here, when English offers a school-rock-style spy academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunites with his former assistant to the Suffering Master Bough, who is once again portrayed by Ben Miller.
Buff is now a man married to a submarine commander, in the role of an annoying classmate, about whom Viko Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So Bateman and Robin of her Majesty's Secret Service reintroduced into a horrific entanglement return to action, with Pam-Patal facing a beautiful Ophelia Bultova portrayed by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously enchanted by a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems – the evil Jason Volta played by Jake Lacey.
English and Bouff begin their own odyssey that is more a farce of two clowns: under the guise of waiters, they set fire to a fancy French restaurant; they create anarchy as they smuggle themselves away on Volta's magnificent yacht; and English sparks complete anarchy in his attempt to use a virtual reality kit to learn to familiarize himself with the inner structure of Volta's house.
There is no doubt that all efforts are made to lead to the final sequence, but despite the kindness and playfulness, it has a sense of television for children.
Pretty mediocre level.
And like the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
The Labour Party denies it is preparing a plan for Britons to work four days a week but get paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a revolutionary plan that would see the British work four days a week but get paid for five days.
According to reports, the party wants company executives to pass on the savings from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers in the form of another day of rest.
I mean, the employees will have a three-day weekend, and they'll still get the same paycheck.
Sources said the idea would be “appropriate” for the company’s economic agenda and plans to tip the country in favor of workers.
The Trade Union Congress supports the transition to a four-day work week as a way for workers to benefit from the changes in the economy.
A senior Labour official told the Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an aspiration that suits the Party’s approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the Party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party will not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party called for a four-day work week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, the ambition is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: “A four-day work week is not a party policy and the party does not consider it.”
Labour’s Finance Minister John McDonnell took advantage of last week’s party conference to formulate his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from “faceless executives” and “price grabbers” in service companies.
The Finance Minister’s plans also stem from the fact that current shareholders in water companies may not receive their full investment back because the Labour government may make ‘reductions’ based on the disclosure of misconduct.
It also confirms that there are plans to include employees in the boards of directors of companies and to create “generally owned funds” to transfer 10 percent of the capital of companies in the private sector to employees, which will pocket annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsay Graham and John F. Kennedy told the TV show "60 Minutes" if the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh changes their minds.
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Cavanaugh delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising the question of whether the findings could convince any Republicans to withdraw their support.
In an idea aired Sunday on 60 Minutes, Scott Pelley asked Senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” said Kennedy.
“I said before the hearing, I said I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, the accusation came up, and I said, ‘Did you do it?’
He was determined, determined, unambiguous.”
Graham's vote, on the other hand, seems to be engraved on the rock.
“I’ve already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and there will be a need for an explosive accusation,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know it: Brett strongly denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“No one she mentioned could verify that.
The matter is 36 years old.
I can’t see how anything can change.”
What is the World Citizens Festival and has it contributed anything to reducing poverty?
The return of New York will mark the World Citizens Festival, an annual music event with an impressive list of stars to appear and an equally impressive goal of ending world poverty.
Held for the seventh time, the Citizens of the World Festival will bring tens of thousands of people to head to a large lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s true purpose – to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the World Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), attendees must complete a series of tasks, or “actions” such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, calling, or other significant ways to help raise awareness for the purpose of ending poverty.
But how successful has the festival really been, with only 12 years to go before it achieves its goal?
Is the idea of giving people a free concert ticket really a way to convince them to demand a call to action, or is it just another case of “climaticism” — people who feel like they are really influencing by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, CIVICUS says it has documented more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, pushing for a variety of different goals.
He said these actions have helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion that will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements as a result of its operations, of which at least $10 billion had already been spent or raised.
The group estimates that the funds allocated so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and practitioners committed to “helping children grow to their full potential,” and promises to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Citizens of the World.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and ‘citizens of the world’ like you, we can turn social justice on malnutrition into a footnote in history,” The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracy Ullman told the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling for Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced a grant for the project, Power of Nutrition, to reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website that asks, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”
“Citizens of the world,” she replied, “this will be a long and difficult path – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great movements before us of civil rights and opposition to apartheid, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monet are among some of the shows that will be featured at this year’s New York event, presented by Deborah-Lee Purns and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. Could Use Navy to Use ‘Marine Quarantine’ to Delay Russian Energy Exports
“If necessary,” Washington could use the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinnac revealed, as quoted in the Washington Examiner.
Zinc argued that the Russian involvement in Syria - which is being done, it is important to mention, at the invitation of the legitimate government - is an excuse for the expansion of new energy markets.
“I believe the reason they’re in the Middle East is because they want to mediate energy, just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe,” he said.
And according to the official source, there are ways and means to deal with it.
“The United States, with our fleet, is able to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, when necessary, to impose a blockade to ensure that their energy sources do not reach the market,” he said.
Zinky spoke to attendees at the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that defines itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are indeed the same.
“The economic potential for Iran and Russia is more or less the leveraging and switching of fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as a “one-trick pony” because its economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come as the Trump administration embarks on a mission to boost its condensed natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russian energy sources, which are a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to cancel its participation in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that, according to Trump, has turned Berlin into a Moscow “captive.”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which is set to double the capacity of the current pipeline to 110 billion square meters, is an economic project alone.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s resolute opposition to the project is motivated solely by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting in Moscow with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September.
The U.S. position was met with a strong backlash from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Industrial Organization (BDI), the leading German industrial organization, has called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempff, head of the German Industrial Organization (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren ‘Seriously Considers’ 2020 Presidential Run, Massachusetts Senator Says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would “consider seriously” the possibility of running for president after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed her intention to run for president during a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington to fix our broken government, and for that, a woman needs to lead,” she told The Hill.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider the presidential race.”
Warren expressed her opinion about President Donald Trump during the meeting in the city hall, saying he was “leading the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren strongly criticized Trump for appointing Brett Cavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that most of Warren’s own voters don’t think she should run for re-election in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of “potential” voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run for office, according to a survey by the University of Suffolk’s Center for Political Research and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the intention to run for the senator’s presidency.
The survey showed that there was more support for the run of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting his run against 48 percent opposing it.
Popular figures from the Democratic Party whose name has risen in connection with a possible 2020 election run-off include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, according to AP reports.
Sarah Palin Marks Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder of Trac Palin at Donald Trump rally
26-year-old Trak Palin spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he’s been going through since he came back, allows me to identify with families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSD and with some of the injuries that our soldiers are coming back with,” she told the crowd at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “the elephant in the room” and said of her son and other veterans, “They come back a little different, they come back stiff, they come back and wonder if what their fellow soldiers and airmen and all the other military personnel gave to the state is respected.”
He was arrested on Monday in the city of Vosila, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, disrupting the reporting of domestic violence and possession of weapons intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a Vosila police spokesman.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the challenge to the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that refuses to provide shelter to victims fleeing situations involving gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filled out a “Friend of the Court” affidavit on Friday in Washington to support the challenge to asylum seekers’ policies, NBC reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Rights Association in August was not disclosed.
She said her “violent sons, members of the gang” abused her, but U.S. government officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Grace's state attorneys described the states of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum applications are filed in the United States, as nations facing many problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the BIA Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented migrants fleeing situations of domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District of Columbia Attorney General, Carl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international laws.”
“Federal law requires that all discussions regarding asylum applications rely on the special facts and circumstances of the application, and the barrier posed by the new policy violates this principle,” the statement said.
The lawyers also argued in the affidavit that the policy, which prevents the entry of immigrants, harms the U.S. economy because they tend to become entrepreneurs and “provide necessary work,” they said.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
“Political asylum is open to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear on grounds of race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a policy statement on June 11.
The purpose of a political asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems -- not even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palo, while the death toll doubles, in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation became more and more difficult.
“There’s a very tense feeling,” said Risa Kosuma, 35, a mother of a baby who is feverish at the evacuation center in the devastated city of Palo.
“At any moment, the ambulance brings bodies.
“Clean water is rare.”
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, burrowing through water-soaked objects, trying to salvage everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were flooded.
Some of the wounded, including Davy Harris, who suffered back and shoulder fractures, were lying outside Palo's military hospital, where they were treated for severe secondary shocks that continued after the earthquake.
Tears filled his eyes as he told how he felt the violent earthquake shaking the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the wreckage of the wall, I think,” Harris told AP, adding that his family was in town to attend the wedding.
“I heard my wife crying for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they are in a safe place.”
US ambassador accuses China of ‘bullying’ with ‘propaganda ads’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily, aggressively promoting the benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press for propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump, speaking on the last Wednesday of a paid supplement to the Chinese newspaper China Daily, in The Moines Register — the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa — after accusing China of attempting to interfere in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections, claimed that China had rejected it.
Trump’s accusation that China tried to meddle in the U.S. election marked a new stage, according to U.S. officials, in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is natural for foreign governments to advertise for trade promotion, Beijing and Washington are currently caught up in an escalating trade war in which each country raises and compares customs rates on products imported from its rivals.
The tariffs, which China raised as retaliation early in the trade war, were intended to hit exporters from countries such as Iowa who supported Trump’s Republican Party, U.S. and Chinese experts said.
Terry Bernstad, the U.S. ambassador to China, a former governor of Iowa for many years, and an important exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Bernstad wrote in an opinion piece in the Sunday edition of The Moines Register, “strengthens bullying by advertising in our free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses America’s precious tradition of free speech and journalism, and publishes a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Bernstadt wrote.
“On the other hand, at the newsstand on the streets of Beijing, you’ll find few dissenting voices and you won’t see any real reflection of the different opinions the Chinese people may have about the worrisome economic trajectory, given that the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most prominent newspapers evaded the proposal to publish” his article, although he did not say which newspaper it was.
Republican Party Removes Women's Votes Before Midterm Election With Kavanaugh Incident, Analysts Warn
While many Republican leaders stand with Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and defend him against multiple sexual assault charges, analysts have warned they will see a backlash, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiments around the issue were particularly lively, and most Republicans are officially demonstrating their desire to move forward in the voting process.
“Such things cannot be reversed,” Grant Rihar, a professor of political science at Circus University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill on Saturday.
He said he doubted that last-minute efforts by Senator Jeff Flake to launch an FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday – they are not going to forget it tomorrow, not in November,” said Carin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive movement MoveOn.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted out “November is coming!” as they demonstrated in the Senate Corridor, while the Republicans in charge of the Senate Judiciary Committee chose to continue promoting Cavanaugh’s appointment, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to a report by Mic.
“The levels of democratic enthusiasm and motivation will break new records,” said Stu Rottenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
“People say they were already high; they’re right.
But they can be higher, especially among women’s floating votes in the suburbs and among young voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who, despite their lack of sympathy for the president, often abstain from voting.
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing her accusations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts said there could be a backlash if Republicans continue to push for confirmation.
“The nomination has left Republicans in serious trouble,” Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh gets the nomination, it’s also about how the Republicans handled it and how they treated it,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, Americans seem to disagree somewhat about the extent of their belief in the words of Ford and Cavanaugh, with slightly higher support for Ford.
A recent YouGov survey showed that 41 percent of respondents believed Ford’s testimony with certainty or most likely, while 35 percent said they believed with certainty or most likely Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Cavanaugh had lied for certain or most likely during his testimony, while only 30 percent said so about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford as well as allegations made by at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Cavanaugh had assaulted her while he was drunk when she was 17.
Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez claims that the Supreme Court nominee revealed his sexuality to her during a party they attended during their time at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor Plans to Start a New Web to Beat Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, is launching a start-up company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of the man who has become a legend in the tech world, is a company that will develop Solid, the open source platform of Berners-Lee.
The Solid platform allows its users to choose where their data will be stored and who will be allowed to access the different types of data.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the start-up.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create a “personal online database” or POD.
The database can include a list of contacts, lists of actions to perform, a schedule, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
Imagine that Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify will all be available in one browser at the same time.
What sets the personal online database apart is that only the user will decide who can access the information and what kind of information can be accessed.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
According to John Bruce, the company’s CEO, Inrupt will find the right resources, process and capabilities to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
Today, the company includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, a team of several developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers from around the world will be able to create distributed apps using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not discussing with Facebook and Google about their agreement or refusal to make a total change that would cause a complete and overnight upheaval in all their business models.
“We’re not asking them for permission.”
In a post published on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission “is to provide commercial energy and an environmental system to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network being built in Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the face of the Internet when he founded the network’s standardization organization, W3C at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Also during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to serve as the founder and director of W3C, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m particularly optimistic about the next era of the network,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: An event to commemorate the cleric who won the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only Anglican clergyman to have won the Victoria Cross during World War I was noted for an event held in his hometown, 100 years after the victory.
Lieutenant-Colonel and Reverend Bernard Van, was awarded the Victoria Cross on 29 September 1918 for his participation in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and was never known to have won the highest British honor.
The memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rasdan, North Hampton County, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said that exposing the stone exactly 100 times after his grandfather won the award was “remarkably symbolic.”
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Van led his regiment and crossed the St. Kentan Canal “through heavy fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns.”
He then hastened to the line of fire and, in the "greatest of chivalry", led the line forward before rushing to take control of a machine gun sub with one hand and toppling three of the company.
Lt. Col. Van was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, one month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I will never be able to match but something that makes me humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also laid a wreath after the parade, led by the Royal Brentwood Youth Orchestra.
Michael Van said he was “very honoured to take part in the parade” and added: “The heroism of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given to many people.”
The mixed martial arts fans stayed up all night to watch the Blur 206, and instead got Pepe Pig.
Imagine that you stayed up all night watching the action of Baltor 206 and were ultimately deprived of the main event.
The San Jose show featured 13 fights, including six on the main ticket, and was aired live overnight on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Jagaard Musasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for battle, viewers in the UK remained stunned as coverage changed to Pepe Pig.
Some of them were not impressed by the change after staying up until the early hours of the morning to watch the fight.
One fan on Twitter described the transition to the cartoon as “a kind of sick joke.”
“This is a government regulation that says that at 6 a.m. the original content wasn’t appropriate and they had to switch to children’s programming,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Balator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppe Pig, yeah."
Blatur’s president, Scott Coker, said they plan to work on their schedules to include future British viewers.
“I think when I think about the rerun, I think we can probably figure it out,” Coker said.
“But it’s 6:00 a.m. on Sunday there and we won’t be able to solve the problem until Sunday in our time zone, that is, on Monday in their time zone.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, during the transition a lot of text messages were exchanged between the parties and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it. We thought it was a technical glitch.
But no, it was a government problem.
I can assure you, next time it's not going to happen.
We’re only going to have five fights instead of six — as we usually do — we’ve tried to give the fans more and we’ve just overreacted.
It’s a matter of misfortune.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daly felt ‘discontinued’ because of his sexual orientation
Tom Daley, the Olympic water jumper, said that as he grew up he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexual orientation — but that feeling motivated him to become a success.
The 24-year-old jumper said he didn’t know until he got to middle school that “not everyone is like me.”
In an interview with Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, directed by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that becoming a parent made him less worried about winning the Olympics.
The regular host of the old show, Christy Young, has been on sick leave for several months.
In his appearance as the star of Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "discomforted" by the others when he grew up because "it was socially unacceptable to love boys and girls."
He said: “Until today, the feeling of inferiority, and the feeling of differentness, were real things that gave me strength and power and allowed me to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so he wouldn’t disappoint everyone when they eventually found out what his sexual orientation was.
The man, who won the Olympic bronze medal twice, became a popular leader of the LGBT community campaign and used his participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call for more countries to legalize homosexuality.
He expressed himself openly on the subject because he felt lucky to have been given the opportunity to live openly and without consequences and wanted to give others “hope.”
The three-time World Championship winner said that falling in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, “catched me by surprise.”
Daley married the Oscar winner, 20 years his senior, last year but said the age gap had never been a problem.
“When you’re going through so much at such a young age” — he attended the Olympics for the first time at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later — he said it was hard to find someone his age who experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley said his “all point of view” had changed.
“If you asked me last year, it all revolved around ‘I need to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“You know what, there are things bigger than Olympic gold medals.
“My Olympic gold medal is Ruby.
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was about to die and that one of the last things he asked was whether they already had tickets for the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him you wouldn’t be here to be in the front row, Dad,” he said.
“I held his hand while his breath stopped and it was only when he stopped breathing that I finally realized that he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
A year later, Daly competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I just knew that’s what I’d been dreaming about all my life – diving in front of my home crowd at the Olympics, there’s never been a better feeling,” he said.
It’s also what inspired him to choose his first song – Heather Small’s Proud – that he identified during the preparations for the Olympic Games and that still makes him a duck skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15, according to British Summer Time.
Michaelson disappointed in performance and went down to the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American golfer Phil Mikaelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays for the 47th time in the Ryder Cup, but he will have to upgrade his performance so that the event does not become a miserable milestone.
Michaelson, who takes part in the 12th annual event and sets a record, fell to the bench at Jim Furrick’s decision during the foursomes and four-ball games on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he did with the U.S. national team, Michaelson, who won five major tournaments, spent half of the day as a cheerleader and the other half working on his game on the sidelines in hopes of correcting the sick evil he suffered.
Even at the height of his career, the player’s performance suffered from declines and ups. Therefore, the 48-year-old Michaelson is not the ideal choice for Le Golf National, where long grass tracks are not usually forgiving for stray bumps.
And if the competition itself is not deterrent enough, Michaelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, competed against the exact British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with starting player Tommy Fleetwood and won all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, who lost four points at the start of the 12 games, were to succeed in the early stages, Mikaelson's game could have been decisive.
“Furerick expressed confidence in his player, though we didn’t expect him to say anything else.
“He totally understood his role today, tapped me on the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” said Fiorik.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He's a member of the Hall of Fame and has added a lot to these teams in the past, and this week.
I didn’t expect him to play two games.
I expected more, but that's how it developed and that's how we thought we should continue.
He wanted to be on the track, just like all the other players.”
Michaelson will break Nick Paldo’s record with the highest number of games in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This may end his career in the Ryder Cup, which never really matched his personal record highs.
Michaelson is credited with 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furick said his presence added some intangible benefits to the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s witty, he likes to make fun of people, and it’s fun to be in the dressing room with him,” he explained.
“I think the younger players also enjoyed having fun with him this week, and it was nice to see that.
There’s a lot more to it than the game itself.”
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows the big advantage could soon be gone
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant advantage before the last day of the singles games of the Ryder Cup could change for the worse.
The Danish player started his career at Valderrama in 1997, with his partner, his grandfather Blastrus, having a five-point advantage over the Americans, whom he almost lost when he crossed the finish line with a minor advantage and won 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“I keep reminding myself that we had a big lead in the Valderrama; we had a big lead in the game in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in the Valderrama where we won but with a slight lead,” said Bjorn, in the photo, after watching the 5-3 win, in the 2018 tournament both on Friday and yesterday, which led to a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
“Then history will prove to me and to everyone on the team that it’s not over.
You have to give it all tomorrow.
You have to get on the right track and do all the right things.
It's not over until the dots are on the board.
We have a goal, try to win the trophy, and we need to focus on it.
I said all along, I’m focused on the 12 players on our side, but we’re very aware of the ones that stand in front of us on the other side – the best players in the world.”
Bjorn was happy with his performances on the difficult golf course and added: "It's important for me to never get ahead of myself when it comes to golf.
Tomorrow could be completely different.
Tomorrow, the focus will be on personal performance, which is completely different.
It's a pleasure to be on the track when everything goes well, but when you're there alone, then your full ability as a golfer is on the test.
And that’s the message to the players: You have to make the most of yourself tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind and he has to make the most of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, opposing team captain Jim Fiorik would expect better personal performance than his players, compared to their performance in the match-up, except for Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Fiorik himself knows both the winning side and the losing side during the important closing days of such tournaments, having participated in the winning team in Brooklyn before losing, when the European team miraculously won the final, as documented in Miracle at Medinah.
“I remember every word,” he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, encouraged his players towards the final day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but I want to be successful in the early stages, as you saw in Brooklyn, and as you saw in Medinah.
When that momentum shifts to one side, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfield.
We prepare our squad accordingly and put the guys on the track according to the feeling we have, you know, we're trying to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the fight and he will face Rory McElroy in the summit game, with Paul Cassay, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Falter, who are the rest of the Europeans in the top half.
“I chose the players in this order because I think he will be able to get us to the end,” Bjorn said, referring to his choice of individuals.
Germany's new warship has been rejected.
Germany’s new navy frigate was due to be accepted in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War-era warships, but was delayed by at least a year, due to faulty systems and reduced costs, local media reported.
The reception of Rheinland-Pfalz, the leading ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates line, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a report by the newspaper D. Zeit quoted by a military spokesman.
The vessel was supposed to join the fleet in 2014, but worrisome issues after the supply shut the floodgates on the ambitious project.
All four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class cruises, which the Navy ordered as early as 2007, will replace the Bremen-class aging frigates.
They are expected to include a powerful cannon, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missile batteries as well as stealth technologies, such as acoustic signatures, infrared and reduced radar.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – the newest frigates can be deployed for up to two years away from home ports.
However, repeated delays mean that the innovative ships – which are supposed to allow Germany to send troops overseas – will become obsolete by the time they enter service.
The lucky frigate F125 made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to accept the vessel and returned it to the Blohm <0x26> Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to build a ship after its delivery.
Little is known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media cited a number of critical "software and hardware deficiencies" that made the warship useless for use on a combat mission.
The software's flaws were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class fleet would be operated by about 120 sailors - about half of the crew used in the older Bremen class frigates.
In addition, the ship was found to have a dramatic overweight that reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add upgrades in the future.
The Rheinland-Pfalz weighs 7,000 tons, and is twice as heavy as the similar type of ship used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the flawed software, the price tag of the entire project – which also includes the training of the team – also becomes a problem.
It is rumored to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) in excess of the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems that fascinate the newest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany’s naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Defense Committee of the German Parliament, confirmed to the Navy that today “the ships that are capable of deploying are running out.”
The official source said the problem had accelerated over time, as old ships had been decommissioned but not replaced with other vessels.
He expressed his regret that no Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate could be attached to the Navy.
The National Fund of Scotland listens to the secret lives of bats
A new study at a mansion in the mountains of Scotland aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to hunt their food.
The hope is that the findings will re-enlighten the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists at the National Foundation of Scotland, will track common bats and European telephones, as well as brown long-eared Dubton bats at Inverio Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be located at key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
The National Health Service (NHS) staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using manual detectors.
Specialized voice analysis of all recordings will determine the frequencies of bat calls and who of the species is responsible for them.
Next, a map of the living areas will be drawn to create a detailed picture of the size of the landscape, of their behavior patterns.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for the National Trust of Scotland (NTS), hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of the management work of living areas, such as the creation of meadows and how to best preserve forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have decreased significantly over the last century.
They are under threat from development and construction work, which affects nesting and loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, and the same is true for fly traps and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks from domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, bat ears are more useful when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-detection technique to detect insects and identify obstacles to their flight path.
The NTS Foundation, which handles more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 760,000 acres of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
She has 10 skilled specialists, who regularly conduct surveys, nesting tests and sometimes rescues.
The organization also established the first and only bat reserve at Thrive Manor in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
Mansion manager David Thompson said the mansion was the ideal territory for them.
“Here in Treve we have a great area for bats,” he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the appropriate living areas.
But many things are not yet known about the bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive.”
He stressed the importance of the test to find the bats before carrying out maintenance work inside the properties, as the unintentional destruction of a single inhabited nest could destroy up to 400 females and puppies, and may also destroy an entire local population.
Bats are protected species and killing, harassing and disturbing bats or destroying their nesting areas are prohibited by law.
Elizabeth Pearl, a Scottish official at the Bat Conservation Foundation, encouraged the public to give a shoulder and help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and about many of our species we just don’t know what their populations are like.”
Ronaldo drops rape charges as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations against him “fake news” and said people “wanted to promote themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portugal and Juventus champions have been accused of raping an American woman named Katherine Muirage in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He then allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
33-year-old Ronaldo turned to his 142 million Instagram followers in a live video a few hours after the allegations were made and scorned fake news reports.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said yesterday, Pike News,” the actor who won the Ballon d’Or five times told the camera.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the job.
I’m a happy person and everything is fine,” the actor added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the allegations, which they referred to as an "inadmissible report of privacy suspicions," Reuters reported.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for “restitution damages in an amount commensurate with the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident allegedly took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Miraga reportedly returned to the actor's room and the actor allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Muirga says Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told her that he was “a good guy” at “99 percent” that he was disappointed with “one percent.”
The documents say Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but that they were consensual.
Muirga also claims that she contacted the police and that pictures of her injuries were taken in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "terrified by revenge actions" and feared "to be publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she is now interested in canceling the settlement because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and moved this summer to Italian club Juventus in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'will forever regret' loss of car manufacturers
Britain will “regret forever” if it loses its position as the world’s leading automaker after Brexit, UK Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that Toyota's interview with the BBC, in which it said that if the UK left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Branston, near Derby, was "worrying".
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays in the case of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Branston plant, which produces Toyota’s Oris and Aventis models, produced close to 150,000 vehicles last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“From my point of view, if the UK leaves the EU without a deal at the end of March, we will see a stop to production at our factory,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s CEO at Branston.
Other UK automakers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement and how it will affect cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what automakers call “supply chain risks” in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is managed on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes, from British and other EU suppliers, to make cars on-demand.
If Britain leaves the European Union without a deal on March 29, border disruptions could result, and industry sources say they could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota will not be able to hold more than one day’s worth of inventory at a factory in Derbyshire, the company says, so production will stop.
Clark said Theresa May’s Checkers program, which details the UK’s future relationship with the EU, was “precisely calibrated to prevent these checks at the border.”
“We need to reach an agreement. We want to reach the best possible agreement, as I said, not only to enjoy success in the present, but also to take advantage of the opportunity,” he said on BBC Radio 4’s Today show.
“The evidence from Toyota and other car manufacturers is that the possibility of continuing to use the successful supply chain system that we have available to this day is absolutely essential.”
Toyota didn’t say how long the shutdown would last, but in the longer term, it warned that the extra costs would hurt the factory’s competitiveness and eventually lead to layoffs.
Peter Tsubalaris, who has worked in Branston for 24 years and serves as president of the Unite Association at the plant, said the union members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, if the jobs are reduced, they will never be returned.
A government spokesman said: “We have put forward an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, on which many depend, could be “delayed for another week” as the battle for Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump aides and Russia and possible obstruction of the president’s investigative proceedings.
The gossip in Washington has been about for months whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and risk Mueller’s independence.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of carrying a wire to record conversations with Trump and get the president removed through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on the last Monday, he arrived at the White House and was reportedly about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was scheduled for Thursday with Trump, who was staying at the United Nations at the time of Rosenstein’s arrival in New York.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but at this point the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, and again rejected the Senate vote.
Trump’s spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
In response to a question about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “No date has yet been set for the meeting, it may take place this week, I can see another postponement of the week given what is happening in the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see and I’m always happy to update the press.”
Some reporters will dispute this assertion: Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the rare briefings did not stem from an aversion to “taking the stand” of television reporters, though she said: “I will not deny that they are taking a stand.”
She then offered to increase the direct link between Trump and the press.
“The president has more question-and-answer sessions than any president before him,” she said, adding without citing evidence: “We’ve looked at the numbers.”
The press briefings will still take place, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it’s much better than talking to me.
“We’ve tried to do this in many cases, and you’ve seen that we’ve done it in many cases in the last few weeks, and meetings that will allow us to talk to the president of the United States will replace the press briefings.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open meetings or press conferences during dignified visits.
His press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated the reason for this, in a loose and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of reporters gathered at the scene.
Health Minister Writes to EU Employees at NHS Scotland Addressing Brexit Concerns
The health minister wrote to the staff of the European Union, who are employed by the National Health Service of Scotland, to express the country's gratitude and ask them to stay after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jean Freeman sent a letter less than six months before Britain’s departure from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already committed to the ownership of permanent status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralized public services.
Ms Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU over the exit have continued, and it is moving towards the decisions expected in the fall.
But the British government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this time can be very worrying for all of you.
That’s why I wanted to go back and say how much I appreciate each team member’s contribution, regardless of their nationality.
Fellows from all over the EU and the world bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
“Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering head injury
University of Tennessee Tigers back-up defender Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury from a 31-27 loss on Saturday to the Vanderbilt University Commodore team, Mike Organ from the Tennessee.
Rod Reed, head coach of the University of Tennessee team, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the halftime.
“He went to the edge of the field and just collapsed there,” Reed said.
The coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen at the edge of the field and then put him on a stretcher and took him for further examination.
An official at the University of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Evercombe was being operated on at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet on the type/size of the surgery" and the University of Tennessee is still trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abracombi is an athletic student and this is his first season with the University of Tennessee after a transfer from Illinois.
He participated in five tackles in total before leaving the game, raising his total of tackles this season to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK and the extra revenue will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Conservative plan.
The move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's move to attract new voters
The stamp tax will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects the tax to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher rate of stamp duty when they buy property in the UK - the extra revenue will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The move appears to be an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s move to attract younger voters, with promises to provide cheaper housing and focus on high-income earners.
Stamp tax will be levied on people and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, and the increase in revenues will strengthen the government’s move to help those who are old in difficult conditions.
The payment, which comes in addition to the current stamp tax, including higher tax levels on secondary housing and real estate investments for rent, could reach a 3% rise.
The Treasury expects the move to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of the new properties built in London are purchased by foreign residents, a situation that causes prices to rise and makes it difficult for people who first purchase a property to set foot on the housing ladder.
Many wealthy parts of the country, especially the capital, have become “ghost towns” because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for stamp duty cuts to help young people buy a first home.
He accused large construction companies of taking land but not using it, and urged Ms. May to abandon affordable housing quotas and fix Britain’s “severe housing shortage.”
Corbyn announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including rent control and a halt to evictions “without guilt.”
He also wants to give councils more power to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my term to rebuilding the British dream – the essence of which is that life is supposed to be better for every new generation.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not right that people who do not live in the UK, as well as companies based in foreign countries, can buy homes as easily as hard-working British residents.
“The dream of becoming a homeowner has become too distant for too many people, and the humiliation of sleeping in difficult conditions is too real.”
Jack Ross: ‘My ultimate ambition is to run Scotland’
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said his “ultimate ambition” was to become Scotland’s manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish enjoys the Northeast Club’s resuscitation challenge, which is currently in third place in the Premier League, three points ahead of the rankings.
He moved to the Light Stadium this summer after leading St. Mirren back to number one in Scotland in the last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
“I played an international game once and that’s it,” Ross told the BBC’s Sportsound.
But when I was growing up, I watched Scotland play a lot at the Hampden with my dad as a kid, and it was always something that drew me back.
“This opportunity will only come if I manage the team.”
Previous Sunderland executives include Dick Advocat, David Moyes, Sam Allerdyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Foye, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alois Athletic says he was not afraid to come after such well-established names at such a large club, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, success is currently being assessed according to ‘Can I bring the club back to the Premier League?’
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it is definitely Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get him there, but I can only see myself as a success story here if I can get the club back there.”
Ross began his management career only three years ago, after a period as assistant manager at Dumberton and 15 months as team coach for the Hearts team.
In the next stage, he helped Alois get out of the third division and raised St. Mirren from the brink of the abyss to her position as champion the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable than ever during his acting career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Fulkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real junction,” he recalls, about taking command of Alois.
“I really believed that the management position was more appropriate for me than the game.
It sounds strange because I played well, I earned reasonably, and I enjoyed a few reasonable records.
But a player’s career can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I still deal with them when it comes to stress at work, but management just feels right.
I’ve always wanted to manage and now I’m doing it, and I’ve never felt more comfortable with myself as an adult.”

The perfect time for pint beer is at 17:30 on Saturday, is in the survey
The summer heatwave increased the profits of the British pubs fighting for their existence, but caused pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups of pubs and bars enjoyed a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July – but restaurant revenues dropped by 4.8 percent, the data revealed.
Peter Martin, of CGA Business Consulting, which compiled the data, said: “The significance of the continued bright weather and England’s longer-than-expected participation in the World Championships is that July had a similar pattern to June’s, in that pub revenues rose by 2.8 percent, but restaurants suffered an even more severe blow.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant trade observed in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars focused on beverages recorded the strongest performance, with a higher increase than the decline in revenue in the restaurant business, compared to the previous period.
Food-focused pubs also suffered from the sun, although their condition was less dramatic than that of restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
Among bars and pub chains, beverage sales increased by 6.6 percent over the month, and food sales fell by 3 percent.
Paul Newman, from RSM, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important sporting or social events are the most important factors when it comes to the outdoor entertainment market.
It’s not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales compared to last year would be particularly painful in addition to all the fixed cost halves.
The long, hot summer couldn’t have come at a worse moment for food-focused businesses, and time will tell if the milder temperatures we experienced in August will bring about a respite from what they so desperately need.”
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand launches.
The UK’s pub, bar and restaurant sector oversight body, the Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 groups, with an integrated business cycle exceeding <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is the benchmark for performance in the sector.
One in five children have social media accounts they hide from their parents.
One in five children – some as young as 11 – have secret social media accounts they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed an increase in fake Insta pages.
The news raised concerns about the publication of sexual content
20 percent of students said they have a “head” account that they show parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – creates accounts on social media that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed a rapid increase in fake Insta accounts - a reference to the photo sharing site, Instagram.
The news raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they run a clean “head” account to show their parents, but they also have private accounts.
A mother who ran into the secret account of her 13-year-old teenage daughter found that she was asking others to “rape me.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Association of School Administrators (HMC) of independent schools in the UK found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles and that half of them admit to having private accounts.
The head of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: “It’s disturbing that so many teens are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.
Doyle will serve as a "voice for athletes" on the Scottish Athletes Board
Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletes Board of Directors as an external director at the Annual General Meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the most decorated light athlete and chairman Ian Beatty described the move as a great opportunity for those who guide the sports to benefit from her rich experience internationally over the past decade.
“Idle has been highly respected by the Scottish, British and global athletic community and we are confident that Scottish athletes will benefit immensely from bringing her to the board of directors,” Beatty said.
Doyle said: “I’m excited to serve as a voice for athletes and hope I can really contribute and help guide sport in Scotland.
The American, who won 200m and 400m at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, and four Olympic gold medals in total, and now regularly serves as a commentator on the BBC, lost his ability to walk after suffering a transient stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time will tell if I will recover or to what extent.
It was hard work, but I recovered completely, learned how to walk again and now performs agility and reaction speed exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!”
Advertisement for milk pumps that compares mothers to cows
A company for milk pumps has split opinions online with an ad that compares nursing mothers to cow milking.
To mark the launch of the pump, which is supposed to be “the world’s first quiet, wearable milk pump,” technology company Elvie has released a humorous video ad to demonstrate the freedom of action that the new pump gives mothers.
Four real moms dance in a barn full of hay to a song that included words like, “Yes, I milk myself, but you can’t see a tail” and “In case you haven’t noticed it’s not udders, it’s my breasts.”
The chorus of the song goes on to say: “I suck, I suck, I feed the babies, I suck, I suck, I milk my girls.”
But the ad, posted on the company’s Facebook page, caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, and many said it sheds light on the “horror” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a very bad decision to use the cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they also have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them within a few days after the birth.”
Elvie’s milk pump fits discreetly into a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another response said: “Traumaticly understandably to the cow and round as one.
But hey, why not use them to advertise a milk pump for mothers who get to keep their babies?”
Another said: “Advertisement is completely disconnected.”
Others defended the commercial, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was “laughing.”
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
The suction made me feel just like a cow.
The advertisement is a little crazy, but I was referring to its content.
“It’s a great product,” someone wrote.
Another said: “This is a funny advertisement for mothers who vacuum (often in their workplace or bathroom) and feel like ‘cows.’”
It’s not an ad that glorifies or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the group of women discovers that they have all danced with the discrete pumps inside their bras.
The idea behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who use a milk pump say they feel like cows.
But Elvie’s pump is completely quiet, with no pipes and wires, it discreetly fits into the breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while pumping.
Anna Blarin, co-head of the early childhood development department at Mother, said: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative launch.
In making the comparison between self-expressing women and dairy cows, we wanted to put the milk pump and all the challenges it has in the spotlight, and to show in an entertaining way, with which we can identify, the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will provide.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two walked down the aisle for designer Martha Jakowski using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to tent camp on Texas border
The number of children in detention has jumped, although the number of crossings of the monthly border has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the Trump administration’s discourse and policies have made it difficult to transfer children to sponsors.
Usually, most of the sponsors were undocumented immigrants themselves, and feared risking their ability to remain in the country by applying for child-responsibility.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult households would have to hand over fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albanes, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The PA later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no prior criminal record.
“Nearly 80 percent of sponsors or members of their household are in the country illegally, and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
That’s why we continue to go after these people,” Mr. Albanese said.
In order to address solutions for children more quickly, officials introduced new laws that would require some of them to appear before a court within a month of their arrest, instead of 60 days as is customary under previous regulations, shelter workers reported.
Many will appear by video conference call, rather than face-to-face, to present their arguments for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not eligible for release will be deported quickly.
The longer these children remain in foster care, the more likely they are to develop anxiety and depression, and this condition can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, shelter workers said and reports from the system have been published in recent months.
Consultants say these concerns are heightened in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where signs of a child’s difficulties are likely to be neglected due to the size of the facility.
They added that moving the children to a tent town without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or break up with friends could worsen the trauma many already face.
Syria tells US, French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mu'alem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country's war is now in its eighth year.
Mu’alem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said the foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext that they were fighting terrorism, and would be “treated accordingly.”
“They should withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the rally.
Muallem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight this holy battle until we have cleared the Syrian territories” of terrorist organizations and “any illegal foreign presence whatsoever.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and advising Kurdish and Syrian forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 fighters on the soil of the war-torn country.
When it comes to the issue of refugees, Mu’alem said the conditions for their return were good and accused “certain Western countries” of “spreading irrational fears” that prompted refugees to stay away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to assist in their return,” he said.
They are politicizing an issue that should only be humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be sent to rebuild Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel outpost, has created an opportunity for progress in political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where 3 million people live.
However, Muallem stressed that the agreement had “clear deadlines” and expressed the hope that the military action would focus on the jihad fighters, including fighters from the victory front linked to al-Qaeda, who would be “destroyed.”
U.N. envoy Stephen de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee, made up of members of the government and opposition, to draft a post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Mualem laid down conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying that the panel’s work should be limited to “examining the articles of the current constitution,” and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberals probably hope, impeachment and scandal end his presidency prematurely.
This will undoubtedly be the most dramatic finale in the history of the presidency of all time!
As of now, there are no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, peak-time viewing has more than doubled to 1.05 million CNN viewers and nearly tripled to 1.6 million MSNBC viewers.
Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers in record hours, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC reached the top of cable ratings with up to 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
“It’s the fire that people are drawn to because it’s not something we understand,” said Neil Barr, executive producer of the ABC drama series The Designated Survivor, which deals with a secretary of state who becomes president after an attack destroys the capital.
Neil Scoble, a longtime comedian and author of Only the Funny Parts: ...and some hard truths about infiltrating the Hollywood Men's Circle, has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was voting for Trump.
She asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Ms. Scoble told me.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike any other television show, the plot lines coming out of Washington could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade ruling, whether immigrant families can be reunited, and the health of the global economy.
Changing a channel or ignoring it is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you go beyond being an educated citizen when you find yourself watching for six hours a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward’s use of a “confidential informant” as a source for Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich bonnet jacket and the implications of the description.
I will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
“Part of what he does, which makes it feel like a reality show, is that he feeds you something every night,” said Burt Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of History for Sale, about Trump’s changing crew and the daily twists in the plot (the war with the NFL, praise for Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to lose one chapter or be left behind.
When I arrived at Mr. Place this week, it was bright outside with a temperature of about 26 degrees on the north coast of Kauai Island, but he shut himself down to watch MSNBC, and recorded CNN at the same time.
He was unable to disengage, not when Brett Cavanaugh was preparing to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember the times when we had all these crazy shows before and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Place told me.
I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Funds from outside sources are flooding the race for the tightest midterm elections in Congress
It’s no surprise that Pennsylvania’s 17th District is facing a tide of money, thanks to the reorganization of congressional districts, which led to a two-member congressional race for the same seat.
The district, a suburb of Pittsburgh whose borders have recently been redrawn, placed Democratic Representative Connor Lamb, who won his seat in another district, in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another congressman, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who now represents Pennsylvania’s 12th district, which largely overlaps with the boundaries of the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the division of former counties had undermined and, contrary to the Constitution, the results favored the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a battle of financial blows in the election campaign between the major parties’ financial weapons, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the March special election, which was widely watched for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat belonged to the Republicans for more than a decade, and President Trump won the county by 20 points.
Political commentators expected a slight advantage for the Democrats.
The U.S. has considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, and has since withdrawn.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with slight resistance from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until his associates expelled Trump’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to return the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in response to “the latest decisions not to recognize Taiwan,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the imposition of sanctions was only considered against El Salvador, which was estimated to have received $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, which included drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in economic aid and targeted visa restrictions, could have hurt a Central American country suffering from high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America rejected an urgent conference that was supposed to focus on safety and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar conference last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from reaching the United States.
But in mid-September, senior government officials made clear their desire to promote the conference, ending all considerations of punishment against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now expected to address the conference, which is now set for mid-October, as a symbol of the importance the administration attaches to him, the diplomats said.
And three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new messages or harsh punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman on Bolton’s behalf declined to comment on the details of the hearing described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal discussions on condition that they remain anonymous.
Their explanations were corroborated by an outside analyst, close to the government, who also spoke anonymously.
Studying History
The next obvious thing may come from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the alleged obstruction of Trump’s investigation, for which there is now substantial evidence in the public records.
Mueller is reportedly directing his investigation into whether Trump’s campaign cooperated with Russia in its attacks on our election campaign.
If control of Congress changes, Trump will find himself accountable to this body, just as he prepares to stand again before voters, and possibly a jury.
There are a lot of questions here that start with “if” and I don’t intend to argue that Trump’s downfall is inevitable — not even for his European counterparts.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must all make choices that will affect how long the fight may last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, if only the West had opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to prevent the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the march of democracy that cannot be stopped, accelerated or delayed.
Americans are now facing a number of such turning points.
What would we do if Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this newspaper reported last year that he had offered to secretly record the president and speculated about his incompetence as president.
Rosenstein said the Times report was inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Cavanaugh is not complete or fair—or if his appointment to the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
And above all, will we vote in the midterms and appoint a congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will go into a long winter nap.
But I believe we won't fail, because of the lessons we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, who also once occupied my magnificent home.
She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light Shabbat candles on the same table holding the swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?”

Graham Durance of the Rangers optimistic about the confrontation in Rapid Vienna
The Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and they know that a win over the Austrians, after the impressive draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for the Europa League G team.
A knee injury prevented Graham Durrance from performing for the first time in the season until a 2-2 tie with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for better performance.
“It was a good point for us because they are a good team,” said the 31-year-old footballer.
We went out to the game believing that we could achieve something and we got a point.
We could have won in the end, but, overall, a draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we were out of the stalemate in the second half and we were the better team.
Thursday will be another big European night.
I hope we can get three points but it will be a tough game because they got a good result in their last game, but with the crowd behind us, I am convinced we can press and get a positive result.
“The last year has been really hard, with everything that’s happened with my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but there’s a good feeling about the place now.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope we can move forward now, put the last season behind us and succeed.
Women stay awake because of this fear about retirement savings
Despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few people talk about it with their family members.
About half of the Nationwide survey participants said they were talking to their partners about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take steps to have the conversation,” said Holly Schneider, vice president of the Nationwide Life Insurance Company.
You can do it the following way.
Talk to your partner and children: You won’t be able to prepare your family for treatment if you don’t express your wishes well in advance.
Help your counselor and family to discuss where and how to get treatment, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Share with your financial advisor: The advisor can also help you find a way to pay for your expenses.
Your financing options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with a sum of money to help cover your expenses, or self-insurance with your capital – as long as you have money.
Prepare your legal documents: Find an early solution to legal battles at this opportunity.
Find and appoint a health care force, a trusted person who will oversee your medical care and make sure that the professionals fulfill your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Also consider signing a power of attorney when it comes to your finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that accounts are paid if you are unfit.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine your older parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications or allergies?
We specified these details in the written plan to be prepared.
“The financial side is not the only point, but also who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare the plan.”

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu, official sources said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
The disaster cut off communications networks and aid officials could not get information from Dongala County, a region in northern Palu that was closer to the source of the 7.5-magnitude noise.
In Palo, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster struck.
Here are a few facts about Palo and Dongal, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palo is the capital of the Sulawesi Central Province, located at the edge of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city marked its 40th anniversary when the tsunami and earthquake hit it.
Dongala is a province spanning over 300 km (180 mi) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The population of the province, an administrative area within the province, was estimated at 299,200 in 2017.
The main sources of income in the economy of the province of Sulawesi are fishing and agriculture, especially in the coastal area of Dongala.
Another important source of income is nickel mining, mainly concentrated in Morvali, on the beach on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palo and Dongal have been hit several times by tsunami waves in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongal.
A tsunami also struck the western Dongal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, known for its seismic activity and is permanently affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the greatest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra, on December 26, caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, and more than half of the dead were killed in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, causing a tsunami that exploded on the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake hits the area near Padang, the provincial capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hit one of the Mantawai Islands, off Sumatra, causing a tsunami up to 10 meters high, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake hit the Pedi Jaya district of Bacha, causing destruction and panic, as locals recalled the post-earthquake devastation and the deadly 2004 tsunami.
The earthquake did not cause the tsunami in this case, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the northern island side.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily abandoned.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Trak Palin, the eldest son of former Alaskan Governor Sarah Palin and former U.S. Vice Presidential candidate, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from the city of Vassila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, disrupting reports of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaskan police forces.
According to the police report, when a mine tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is being held in the Mat-soo-Prital facility under $500 bail, according to a KTUU television report.
According to the network, he appeared before the court on Saturday, declaring himself “not guilty, for sure,” when asked to flatten his claims.
Palin is charged with three types of A behavioral offenses, and could therefore be jailed for a year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a type B behavioral offence, which could result in a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of reporting a crime of domestic violence, and possession of weapons under intoxication in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
Groups of veterans criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut and the rate of losses is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near the center of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos, distributed on social media, show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered to celebrate at a beach festival in Palo City when the tsunami wave shattered on the beach.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for suspected terror attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Saipolo Saipov, the suspected terrorist in New York City who killed eight people - a rare punishment that has not been carried out for a federal crime in the country since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov allegedly used a rented truck from Home Depot to carry out a bike lane attack alongside the West Side Highway in south Manhattan, and ran over pedestrians and cyclists who got on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Seipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious bodily harm, according to a statement of intent for the death penalty request filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, the death penalty can be imposed on these two counts.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury slapped Saipov with an indictment of 22 counts, including eight counts of extortion-assisted murder, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning in advance and with intent,” prosecutors said, describing Saipov’s way of carrying out the attack as “degraded, cruel and sick.”
“Sipollo Habibolovich Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laur Decked, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlej, Hernan Prochey, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damien Fenico,” the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last time the Southern District of New York filed a death sentence in the case was a decade ago.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not express remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about his actions, police said.
Saipov told authorities he had been inspired by the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
According to police, he also asked to hang an ISIS flag in the hospital room where he was staying.
He claimed to be innocent in response to the 22-page indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal defense attorneys representing Saipov, said they were “of course disappointed” by the prosecution’s decision.
“We think that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting an admission of guilt that would lead to a life sentence with no possibility of release will only extend the trauma of these events to all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team has previously asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Prague should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Prague vowed to ‘mobilize the People’s Army’ today during a protest at the Conservatives’ Conference.
The former leader of the UKIP party said politicians must “feel pressure” from the eurosceptics – when a Conservative MP from Theresa May argued that he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Boone said in a march in Birmingham that Britain “would have been out” at this point if Prague had been Brexit secretary.
But May’s challenge, the reconciliation of the deeply divided lines of conservatives, was underscored by the fact that conservatives who support remaining in the European Union joined a different anti-Brexit demonstration in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep her compromise plan, the Chequers, on its way despite attacks from Brexiteers, Brexiteers and the European Union.
The allies insisted that they would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the backlash – forcing the Eurosceptics and Labour party to choose between their agreement and ‘chaos.’
At a meeting of the Leave Means Group in Solihull, Boone said he wanted to “break up with Chequers.”
He argued that Prague should have been accepted as a friend and should have been in charge of the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we would be out by now,” he said.
MP from Wallingboro added: “I will defend Brexit but we have to say goodbye to Chequers.”
He stressed his opposition to the European Union and said: “We did not fight the two world wars to be enslaved.
We want to set our own rules in our own country.”
Mr. Bonn dismissed the claims that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay is completely false.”
Conservative MP and Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins was also on the march, telling reporters: “I’m simply saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers program is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our activists who took to the streets and elected us in the first place.
Please, let go of the chakras and start listening.”
In a critical statement to May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Prague said at the conference that politicians should be made to “feel the pressure” if they are to betray a decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them, ‘We’re not going to let you get away with it.’
He added, in a message to the enthusiastic audience: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel pressured.
“We call on the people’s army of this country, which has given us the victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing and proud Britain.”
At that moment, supporters of the stay marched in Birmingham and then held a two-hour conference downtown.
A handful of activists waved “Conservatives Against Brexit” posters after the group was formed this weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis mocked at the opening of the Conservative conference about the security issues they suffered with the party's app.
“These are people who are telling us that they can have IT systems and all the possible technology for an agreement like Canada Plus Plus, frictionless border crossing and borderless free trade in Ireland,” he said.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9A>This is completely ridiculous.
“There’s no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to ‘consider seriously’ running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “seriously consider running for president” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democratic senator from Massachusetts spoke about her future during a meeting at a town hall in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who frequently criticizes President Donald Trump, is running for midterms in November against Republican Jeff Dill, who served as co-chair of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts election campaign.
She has been at the center of rumors that she may be running against Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke, which took place on Saturday afternoon, is the 36th meeting that has been held with voters in a meeting format at the city hall since Trump took office.
He asked her if she would run for president.
Warren said it was time for “women to come to Washington to fix our broken government and get a woman in charge.”
Arrest in the case of Simms's death shooting from LSU
Police in Louisiana’s capital, Baton Rouge, announced on Saturday that the suspect in the shooting that killed LSU basketball player Wade Sims had been arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson during a press conference at 11 a.m.
Police released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a person seen in the footage.
20-year-old Simms was shot and killed near the University of Southern California campus early on Friday.
“Wade Simms suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually got rid of it,” police chief Murphy J. Poole told media on Saturday, as reported by 247sports.
Wade tried to protect a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being on the scene with a gun and singing at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody by the Baton Rouge Eastern District Police.
The nearly two-meter-tall junior played in 32 games with 10 starts in the last season and an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton finishes world title after team rankings gave him victory over Sebastian Vatel
It was clear, from the moment Valtry Bottas made the next step ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, that the Mercedes team’s rankings would play an important role in the race.
From the very beginning, Bottas had a good start and left Hamilton almost alone, defending his place in the first two rounds and inviting Wattle to attack his teammate.
Wattle set out for a stopover first and let Hamilton blend in with the competition's tail, apparently a crucial decision.
The Mercedes team made a stopover later and returned to the race behind Wattle, but Hamilton moved forward after a tight-knit wheel fight in which the Ferrari driver was forced to leave the inside track in order to hold out risk-free after a double move in the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started from the back row of the rankings and was in seventh place at the end of the first round.
He then drove for a large part of the race and did not change tires to get a quick finish and beat Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He eventually dropped to an intermediate stop in the 44th round and was unable to pick up the pace in the remaining eight rounds when Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's a tough day because Walteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman when he let me get around it.
The team did an extraordinary job to get to the double,” Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a conference on Saturday in connection with her insistence that she had not leaked a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh of sexual assault.
During his speech at a conference in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead saying that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “bad and nasty and liars.”
“The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people angry and bad and mean and lying,” he said.
“When you look at publications and leaks and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... Did you leak the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
So, wait a minute.
Did we leak... No, we didn’t,” he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received a letter from Ford detailing the charges against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September — but Feinstein denied the leak had come from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s charges, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked me to keep the letter as confidential as she asked me to.”
But the senator’s denial did not seem to have been accepted by the president, who responded to it during the conference on Saturday night: “I’m telling you, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe it’s not [the leak], but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, and claimed that the Democrats use the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to return to power at all costs.
You see the convictions, the despicable ones, they don’t care who they hurt, who they run over on the road to power and power,” the president said.
High League: Dundee stars in a 5-3 result against the Belfast giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee stars made amends for their loss to the Premier League on Friday against the Belfast giants and won the next 5-3 match, in Dundee on Saturday.
The giants had an early advantage over two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis at Wheeler.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney brought their team back into the fold until Dwyer returned the advantage to the giants.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard equalised for the Dands until two of Lucas's exiles, Landwald Nielsen, secured the victory.
This is the third loss in a senior league season for Adam Keefe’s team, which emerged from behind to beat the Dandies 2-1 in Belfast on Friday.
This is the fourth meeting between the two teams during the season, and the Giants have won the previous three games.
Dwyer’s first goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaul’s cooking, and David Rothford cooked up Bevillier’s goal by doubling the score four minutes later.
In an active first trimester, Sullivan returned the home team to the game at 13:10 until Matt Markwardt cooked Kawny's equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' advantage on the first break when he scored his second goal in the evening, at the end of the first third.
The home team was re-evaluated and Buhari again scored a goal that matched the power play at 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give the Danes a lead for the first time in the game, at the end of the second trimester, and Nielsen secured the Danes victory with the fifth goal, which he scored from half the field in the last third.
The giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will face Milton Keynes in their home field in the next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller has sacrificed his life to ensure hundreds of passengers on board can escape an earthquake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been crowned a hero for sacrificing his life to ensure a plane with hundreds of passengers takes off safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many are missing after a powerful earthquake hit Sulawesi Island on Friday and caused a tsunami.
Strong sub-shocks continue to hit the area and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palo.
But even though many of his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Ganewan Agung refused to abandon his position, in a strongly oscillating control tower at Mutiara Cisse al Joffrey Airport in Palo.
He remains in place to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321 can take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Johannes Sirite said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to an ABC News report.
We made a helicopter from Balikpan Airport in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palo.
“Our hearts are broken to hear the good news,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands because, according to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, access to Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
“The death toll is believed to continue to rise as many bodies are still buried under the rubble and access to many others is not possible,” agency spokesman Satopo Foro said.
Waves as high as six meters destroyed Palo and the city will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and equipment.
Risa Kosuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Ambulances bring bodies every minute.
Clean water is rare.
The mini-markets are looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of Indonesia’s Red Cross, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working quickly to help the survivors but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get even worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the troops: “I am asking all of you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
Air New Guinea says one person missing after plane crash in Laguna
The airline, which operated the flight that crashed into the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, now says one person is missing, having previously stated that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air New Guinea said in a statement that starting Saturday afternoon, it was not possible to say what happened to one passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or citizenship.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and other crew members after the plane hit the water while attempting to land at the island of Chowk.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained at the hospital on Saturday and that all remaining passengers were in stable condition.
The exact cause of the crash and the exact course of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in Laguna, a short distance from the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
American traveler Bill Jaines said the plane had reached a very low orbit.
“It’s a very positive thing,” said Janes.
Janes said he and the others managed to make their way to the water emergency exits at waist-high in the sinking plane.
He said the crew was nervous and screaming, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby on improving the dock also helped with rescue operations, using an inflatable boat that brought people ashore before the plane sank in waters about 30 meters (100 feet) deep.
According to data from the Air Safety Network (ASN), 111 people have been killed in crashes by airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the past two decades, but Air New Guinea has not been involved in any of these incidents.
An analyst details the course of events on the night a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution proved its case on Saturday, in a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to put together the movements of the defendant, 29-year-old Quinton Tallis, and the movements of the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, the night she was murdered.
According to the Clarion Ledger report, Rowlett said he received location data from a number of mobile phones that showed Tallis was with Chambers the night she died, contradicting his earlier claims.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went out to talk to Sanford.
Sanford got on the stand and testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Talis had spoken the truth when he said he was with Sanford that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tallis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records say they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers’ death, Talis deleted Chambers’ text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He wiped it out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense will begin its closing speech on Sunday, as planned.
The judge said he expects the trial to go to jury trial later that day.
The High Breed: What is Hip Hop Consciousness?
The hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative opinion of the genre and fill its music with positive messages.
The High Breed trio of Bristol argues that hip hop has moved away from its sources as a tool for expressing political messages and attacking social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as the Fujiz and the Common have recently been resurrected in the UK through artists such as Akala and Loki.
Another black man?
New York therapist sues couple for dismissal after “racist” text message
A New York-based therapist sues a couple for dismissal on grounds of discrimination after receiving an unsolicited text message from the mother who complained that the therapist was “another black person.”
The couple denied he was a racist and compared the lawsuit to "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flexman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment when she found out that her new babysitter, Giselle Morris, was black when she reached her first day of work in 2016.
“No, no, no, no, no, no. Another black man,” Ms. Flasco-Flexman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, twice.
According to a New York Post report, after noticing the ejaculation, Plasco-Flexman fired Ms. Morris, saying that the former nurse, who was of African-American descent, had done a bad job and that she was now expecting to hire a Filipino instead.
Mrs. Morris was paid for one working day and sent home with Uber.
Now, Morris is suing the couple for dismissal, seeking $350 a day compensation for six months of work and living in the place for which they were originally hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them, look, they don’t do things like that,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple fought back over claims that they were racist, saying that ending Morris' employment was required, out of fear that they would not be able to trust her after she was hurt.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t mean to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists,” her husband Joel Falasco told the Post.
But did you place your child in the hands of someone you were rude to, even if it was an accident?
Your little baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the lawsuit to "extortion" and said his wife was only due to give birth two months before the incident and was "in a very difficult situation".
“Do you want to go after someone like her?
It’s not nice to do that,” added the investment banker.
The legal case is still in progress, but the court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, killing their behavior and the arguments they used.
New Letter Reveals Paddington Publishers Feared Readers Won't Identify with Talking Bear
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jenkle, who was born shortly after the book was received, said of the letter: “It’s hard to imagine yourself in the place of someone reading the book for the first time before it was published.
It’s very amusing to know now what we know about Paddington’s tremendous success.”
After saying that her father, who worked for the BBC as a photographer before he was inspired to write the children’s book from a small toy bear, would become bloodthirsty about rejecting his work, she added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was bitter-sweet, after his death last year.
She added that her father was quietly proud of Paddington’s eventual success, which she described as “a very important member of our family.”
“He was a quiet man, not an arrogant man,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who achieves something: you’re proud of him even though it’s not really because of you.
I think he saw Paddington's success sort of like this.
“Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always said it was thanks to Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying, and I had to say hello to her on the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
Ned called fluently and said she was in a really bad condition, which is unlikely to last.” said Mrs. Adnan-Laprose.
“Then I got a call from Ned saying that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating slowly went out of her system.
She died sometime before that and it's over. It's all over.
All I could do was sit there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn’t whimper or scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people right now.
I really had to hold on.”
In the end, Mrs. Adnan-Lapros, now grieving over the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane alongside other passengers who were unaware of her ordeal.
No one knew,” she said.
My head was bent, and tears were flowing all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I had an overwhelming sense of identification with Ned.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women grieving hangings visible on bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones who committed suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys hung postcards on a bridge in Walsh with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people could call to get support.
Mrs. Davis’ son Tyler was 13 when he became depressed and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any other parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Leedney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone recognized him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up every room.
But he stopped working before he died, because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, “I am constantly afraid of a chain reaction.”
Mrs. Davis created the postcards, “so that people would know there was someone to talk to, even if it was a friend.
Don’t sit still – you need to talk.”
Ms. Humphreys, Mrs. Davis’ friend for years, lost Mark, a life partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother’s death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed or depressed or anything,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was down on Christmas Day – when the kids opened the presents, he didn’t make eye contact with them or anything like that.”
She said his death was a tremendous trauma for them, but they overcame it: “It creates a hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to keep fighting.”

Burt Cavanaugh’s future is at stake as the FBI begins its investigation
“I thought, if we can really get what he asked — a limited-time and limited-scale investigation — maybe we can bring a little bit of unification,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be “cut apart” in the deep-seated party impasse.
Why were Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters not interested in an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance stems entirely from the timing.
The midterm elections will be held in just five weeks, on November 6, and if, as expected, the Republicans fail, they will be very weakened in their attempts to bring the man they want to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush picked up the phone and called the senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through him met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush’s personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently holds 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not clear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate to allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
Number of defectors in North Korea 'descended' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byung-sig, citing data from the South Korean Union Ministry, said the number of defections last year was 1,127, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the main reasons were a tightening of the border between North Korea and China and an increase in the amount of money people smugglers charge.
Pyongyang has not made a public statement.
The vast majority of defectors from North Korea eventually receive South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them are fleeing through China, with which North Korea has the longest and easiest border to cross compared to the well-guarded military zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats the deserters as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier in the news, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on stalled nuclear disarmament negotiations.
The meeting followed the historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where the two generally agreed to work toward an era when the Korean peninsula would not have nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused U.S. sanctions of lack of progress since then.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will unilaterally disarm first,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bert Cavanaugh “hysterical” and says he is not fit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court nominee “hysterical” and said his character did not allow him to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi responded in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman ever showed up like this, they would say ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of her reaction to Cavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Cavanaugh emotionally rejected allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and sometimes almost screamed and choked when talking about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly denounced Democrats on the committee and called for arguments against him as a "coordinated and grotesque character murder" organized because of the anger of liberals over Hillary Clinton's loss of the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony had proved he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it was biased against Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with these statements and the way he was chasing the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked whether she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if his nomination was approved and if the Democrats won a majority in the House.
“I say it like this — if he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not suitable, not just for his term on the Supreme Court, but for the court he’s currently serving,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge at the District of Columbia Federal Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she has concerns about possible Kavanaugh rulings against Obama’s health reform or the Rue v. Wade ruling, as he is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearing, Cavanaugh evaded questions about the possibility of overturning certain Supreme Court decisions.
“There’s no reason for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and expect it to be said, ‘That’s not great,’” Pelosi said.
And women need to use it.
It is a harsh criticism, months and years of rage, and it cannot express them without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, do I?”
She continued, “I got a lot of help from a woman who was a manager elsewhere, who said she was crying when she got angry, but she developed a technique and every time she got angry and started crying, she used to tell the person she was talking to, ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept going.
I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as a way to escape anger, in part because they are inherently incomprehensible.
One of the most significant memories of an early career in my life, in an office with a male majority, was that I once found myself crying in unexpressed rage, and an older woman grabbed my back, a cool manager that I had always been a bit afraid of—and dragged me into the stairwell.
“Don’t let them see you ever cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be happy because they’ve managed to suppress you.”
Patricia Schroeder, who was a Colorado congresswoman at the time, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an out-of-marriage affair on a ship called Monkey Business and left the race, Schroeder, who was deeply frustrated, realized there was no reason for her not to consider the idea of running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a decision I thought about very well,” she told me 30 years later and laughed.
“There were seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since she joined the campaign late, she was behind in fundraising, and therefore swore she would not join the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
“They think I’m getting a discount?” she wondered.
In her speech announcing that she would not embark on an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings of gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and focus on voters instead of representatives, and anger at sexual discrimination, she choked with tears.
“You would think I had a nervous breakdown,” recalled Schroeder in the way the press had reacted to her.
“You’d think I’d been sponsored by Klinx.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my tombstone?
“She was crying”?
How the U.S.-China Trade War Could Benefit Beijing
The opening salvos of the U.S.-China trade war have been deafening, and while the battle is far from over, a rift between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the opening shot earlier this year when he imposed a tax on China’s important export products, including solar, steel and aluminum collectors.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 million) worth of goods, effectively taxing half of goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing responded each time in the same currency, and recently increased tariffs by five to ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to strike back at every blow the United States has made, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will capitulate in the near future.
A request for Washington to back down would mean giving in to its demands, but a public bow to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing manages to do well, the pressures from the trade war with the U.S. could positively support China in the long run and reduce the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the start of economic upheaval in any of the countries is actually far more dangerous than predictors have previously admitted,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused research partner at the New American Security think tank.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for aid to rebuild the country destroyed in a long war that has lasted more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mu'alem said conditions were improving.
“Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress achieved in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas that were destroyed by the terrorists in order to restore normalcy.
All the conditions now exist for the refugees to voluntarily return to the country they left because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at harming their daily lives and livelihoods.
According to UN estimates, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mu’alem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid for rebuilding the destroyed state.
But he stressed that the regime would not receive conditional aid or assistance from the countries that financed the rebels.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5–10.5 on the Le Golf National track outside Paris, France.
The United States has lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown again when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points it needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mikaelson, who has struggled for almost the entire tournament, sent his shot from the T-Side to the water in the 16th hole of the Par-3, and lost the game against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has shined in all of his rounds, becoming one of the four players who have reached 5–0 since the start of the tournament in the current structure, in 1979.
American player Jordan Spit was defeated 5 and 4 by the lowest-ranked player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olsen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the number one player in the world, lost 2-1 to Ian Fuller of England, which may be the last time he will play for the Ryder Cup.
With eight Ryder Cup appearances, the Spaniard Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a has become the European player with the highest number of tournament wins with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help it today.
It's been a rough year.
So I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to have the trophy back.
It’s a team, and I’m glad I could help,” Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot John Ram who defeated American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in Sunday’s singles game.
“The immense pride I feel, beating Tiger Woods, which I watched growing up,” said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods has lost all four games in France and his record is now 13-21-3, a career Ryder Cup record.
This is a strange statistic from one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 important titles, with only Jack Niklaus ahead of him.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find their way on the lawns, with the exception of Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Pineau who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Fiorik spoke after his team’s disappointing performance, “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
There was a moment this morning when we were putting pressure on Europe.
We failed.
Well done to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the American Professional Golf Association and our Ryder Cup committee, and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to serve as captain.
We need to take our hat off.
We've been defeated."
