Rapidly increasing cumulative number of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative number of COVID-19 shows similar trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK, which confirms that although the stage varies depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly worsening in all countries.
Based on Italy’s experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their readiness to increase the number of COVID-19 patients who will need health care, particularly intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a series of cases of pneumonia of unknown pathogens were reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent, the novel coronavirus, is now referred to as SARS-CoV-2.
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that almost 80% of individuals with COVID-19 have mild illness; that is, respiratory infections with or without symptoms, and most of these recover.
In approximately 14%, the incidence of COVID-19 has worsened to a more severe disease requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% suffer from a serious illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate of patients who stayed in hospital due to COVID-19 was about 4%.
In this study, we assess trends in the cumulative number of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare them with those from Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with the number in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
After what happened in China, COVID-19 has increasingly spread geographically and the COVID-19 pandemic dynamics in the rest of the world are now tracking the dynamics of this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the Eurosurveillance issue of March 5, 2020, Spiteri and others reported the first confirmed European COVID-19 cases as defined by the World Health Organization.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 for people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the UK, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported between 31 December 2019 and this date, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Cumulative Number and Cumulative Rate of COVID-19 Cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases reported in each country worldwide, obtained only from official sources such as the Ministry of Health of countries, national and regional health authorities and the World Health Organization, is updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
This data was used to assess the trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and compare them with those in Italy.
As a measure of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative number of intermittent COVID-19 cases over 14 days, and then taking into account the normal course of COVID-19, in all EU/EEA countries and the UK, between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases reported from each country as of 15 March 2020 at 8:00 a.m., compared to the number in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
Covid-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
Trends in the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases extracted over a 14-day period in EU/EEA countries and the UK followed those of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom in general, the cumulative number of COVID-19 began to increase around February 21, and then increased sharply around February 28, 2020 (supplementary material).
This was often driven by a rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but all EU/EEA countries and the UK showed trends of a similar increase to the cumulative number of COVID-19 (a supplement).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
As of March 15 at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK have reported the total number of cases already similar to those in Italy just 3 weeks ago or less.
Our results suggest that the number of COVID-19 cases reported is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trends observed in the cumulative number of COVID-19 indicate that the pandemic is worsening at a similar pace in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages, despite different national public health responses, and the possibility of different definitions of the situation in different countries and protocols to select patients who must undergo testing to confirm their COVID-19 status, including follow-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected areas of Italy described the situation where about 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in those areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on hospital admissions and/or intensive care units for COVID-19 cases are currently available at EU/EEA level for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not shown).
However, they need to be collected in a systematic manner to complement existing surveillance data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A 2010-11 study showed a significant diversity in the availability of intensive and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care beds and intermediate care beds per 100,000 people in 2010–11).
Modeling scenarios associated with health care capacity saturation, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the UK of COVID-19 cases hospitalized associated with 90% risk of overcapacity in intensive care beds, are available in the sixth update of the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention’s COVID-19 Rapid Risk Assessment.
Because cases that have so far been clustered in specific regions in EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve specific regional populations, information on cases and intensive care beds is preferable at the NUTS-2 designation level.
Italy’s experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly worsening in the EU/EEA and the UK.
States, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore prepare themselves for the scenario of a sustainable SARS-CoV-2 community transition and an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients in need of health care, especially intensive care, such as is happening in the affected areas of Italy.
As outlined in the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention’s Rapid Risk Assessment, a proactive and comprehensive rapid approach is key to delaying the spread of SARS-CoV-2 while shifting from a containment to mitigation approach, as the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide decision makers and hospitals with enough time to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly if not implemented in advance.
The Rapid Risk Assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a limited opportunity during which countries can step up their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on health care.
If this fails, healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face an increase in the number of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere, causing a humanitarian disaster.
SARS-CoV-2, similar to a similar virus, SARS-CoV, which infected thousands of people with SARS in 2003, can also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower risk and mortality rate than SARS, but is more transmitted and more influential among older adults than younger adults and men than women.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications related to emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a comprehensive and timely review of a rapidly evolving research topic.
We will address the basics of disease epidemiology, its causes, its virology, its diagnosis, treatment, disease prognosis, and prevention.
While many questions still need to be answered, we hope this review will help understand and eliminate the disease that poses a threat.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who have been urged to stay indoors throughout the holiday and for many weeks afterwards due to an outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (COV) that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003; hence, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-COV-2 on February 11, 2020, and the associated disease was named CoV-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and soon spread throughout the country, as well as to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has led to 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged from hospitals and more than 3,000 dying.
The World Health Organization warns that COVID-19 is “public enemy number one” and potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 research papers on COVID-19 have been published covering the virus science of the disease, its epidemiology, its etiology, its diagnosis, and its treatment, since the first report of many patients on January 7, 2020 that identified the sequence of the virus.
This review aims to summarize research progress in a new and rapidly evolving subject area.
Whenever possible, we will seek to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by Cove, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, an outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far in terms of disease prevention and prognosis as well as some pressing questions that remain on the table.
Corona viruses have traditionally been considered non-fatal pathogens in humans, mainly causing about 15% of the four common colds.
However, in this century, we have encountered two severe disease-causing coronaviruses in humans, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused outbreaks originally in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and the disease quickly spread to many other countries with a terrifying rate of spread and death.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of the coronavirus in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, groups with idiopathic pneumonia were first reported by Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to China’s National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was released.
On January 15, 2020, Wuhan reported the death of the first case.
Meanwhile, the epidemic quickly spread to cities, counties and neighboring countries.
On January 20, infections were reported among health care providers, indicating that the disease could be transmitted from person to person.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was closed with all public transport suspended.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that of the 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients were in direct contact with the Wuhan Seafood Market, which considered the site of onset of infection from an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease had already spread throughout China and around 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).
As the situation develops rapidly, the final extent and severity of the outbreak remain to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multicenter study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, provided a more up-to-date explanation of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX<0x5F>rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all age groups, but mainly those aged between 30 and 65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years old, very few were under 20, and only 14 were under 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has expanded among groups mainly in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from the onset of infection to diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from inception to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproduction number (PNR) was 3.77 (the range of confidence is 95%: 3.51-4.05), and the modified PNR was 2.23-4.82.
The number of casualties increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, in line with the many travels ahead of the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate among confirmed patients was 1.44% (the confidence interval is 95%: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (the confidence interval is 95%: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60), and acute pneumonia.
Corona viruses are a class of large, encapsulated viruses that contain a single-chain RNA genome.
It can be divided into four genera, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, and the sexually transmitted viruses alpha and beta are known to infect humans.
The coated fork (S) of the diabetic protein binds to its cellular receptors, the enzyme converting angiotensin 2 (ACE2) and dipetidyl peptides 4 (DPB4) to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released to the cytoplasm; after the viral genome is cloned, the genomic RNA, accompanied by sugary envelope proteins and nucleated capsid proteins, forms vesicles containing virions, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be a new type of beta-cove with a genetic identity exceeding 99.98% among 10 sequencing samples collected from the original site of the outbreak, the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more like SARS-CoV than Mears-CoV.
Electron microscopy of the transmission revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is present in extremely thin sections of human airway epithelium.
Angiotensin-2-converting human enzyme has been shown to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV-2.
However, the S protein from SARS-CoV-2 binds to the human enzyme converting angiotensin-2 weaker than SARS-CoV, which corresponds to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form an emerging short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
Orf3b in SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenesis and limit the expression of IFN<0xCE><0xB2>; however, orf8 does not contain any scale or pattern that has a known function.
On February 18, 2020, Zhu et al. reported the structure of the entire length of the human enzyme converted to angiotensin 2 under a supercold electron microscope with an accuracy of 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> within a compound with an amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They discovered that the compound, which had open and closed structures, had converged to form a demerit and that ACE2-B0AT1 could bind to the S protein, providing evidence for identification of the coronavirus and infection.
The sodium-based neutral amino acid carrier may become a therapeutic target for drug testing to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Original Host and Intermediate Host
It has been known that both SARS-CoV and Mers-CoV originated from bats and were transported to humans through civets and camels, respectively.
By comparing the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 strains with other coronaviruses, bats were considered to be the original host of SARS-CoV-2, with the new virus matching 96% with bat-like SARS viruses called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that helped the virus cross the barrier between species to infect humans remains unknown, and the route of transmission has not yet been elucidated.
J. et al. proposed snakes as a carrier of the virus from bats to humans, which involved a symmetrical recombination of the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, have suggested that squamous ant-eaters – an ant-eating long-tongue mammals often used in traditional Chinese medicine – are the potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic symmetry in the SARS-2 virus.
However, the 1% difference spread across two genomes is still a significant difference; therefore, we await conclusive results from the concrete evidence (Figure 33).
The physical-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in the laboratory for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20<0xC2><0xB0>C and humidity between 40% and 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to UV rays and heat at 56<0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol at a concentration of 75%, and disinfectants containing chlorine, pyroxyacetic acid, chloroform, and other fatty solvents, but not chlorohexidine, can effectively inhibit the virus.
The entire human race generally lacks immunity against SARS-CoV-2, so they are more likely to be infected with the new virus.
Currently, no detailed study on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has been received.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies that relate to other coronaviruses, particularly SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
In general, after an invasion of a host virus, the natural immune system recognizes it through pattern recognition receptors (PRRS), including lectin-like type C receptors, TLR-like receptors, nucleotide-binding domain-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-like receptors.
Through different pathways, the virus induces the emergence of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate macrophage cells to viral antigens.
However, the N protein in SARS-CoV can help the virus escape immune responses.
The adaptive immune response quickly joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B>, play an important role in defense.
CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate B cells to produce antibodies dedicated to the virus, and CD8<0x2B> T cells directly kill HIV-infected cells.
Auxiliary T cells produce stimulant cytokines for inflammation to help defend cells.
However, the coronavirus can reduce the functions of T cells by inducing the programmed death of T cells.
Mixed immunity, including complementary proteins such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential in the fight against viral infections.
For example, I neutralized isolated antibodies from a recovering Mears-Cove patient.
On the other hand, the overreaction of the immune system generates a large number of locally free radicals that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs and, at worst, failure of multiple organ functions and death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, initially seen in groups, is more likely to affect older people with multiple diseases and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune function has been damaged to be more likely to become infected than others.
The estimated average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, or usually 3 to 7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases shows that the incubation period averaged 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on 8,866 cases.
It is crucial that health authorities adjust effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period, thus preventing infected but asymptomatic people from transmitting the virus to others.
As a common practice, people exposed to or infected with the virus are usually required to undergo quarantine for 14 days.
Do I have to extend the quarantine period to 24 days?
Fever is often the main and primary symptom of COVID-19, and may not be accompanied by any symptoms or other symptoms, such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, nasopharyngitis, chest pain, feeling sick, and vomiting.
Some patients experienced shortness of breath and/or hypoxia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients developed rapidly to suffer from acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and thrombopathy.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and severe fever should be screened, even without an imaging that detects pulmonary abnormalities, for an early diagnosis of the virus.
A demographic study in late December 2019 showed that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for shortness of breath, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed respiratory support.
Similar results were reported in two recent studies of a family group and a group that had been infected by a person who did not show symptoms.
By comparison, a demographic study in 2012 showed that Mears-Cove patients also suffered from fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and shortness of breath (55%) as major symptoms.
However, 80% of them needed respiratory support much more than COVID-19 patients and were consistent with the higher mortality rate for MERS than for COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in Mears patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), shortness of breath (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were the most important symptoms, and respiratory support was needed for about 14%-20% of patients.
By 14 February, the death rate from COVID-19 was 2 percent, while the confirmed cases were 66,576 globally.
By comparison, the death rate from SARS by November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For Mears, the death rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases, based on a demographic study conducted in June 2012.
A previous study reported that SARS-CoV-2's baseline reproductive number was as high as 6.47 with a 95% CI range from 5.71 to 7.23, while SARS-CoV's baseline reproductive number ranged from only 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of their own symptoms, mortality rate, and baseline reproduction number is shown in Table 1.1.
The figures above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater diffusion capacity than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less lethal than the latter two.
Therefore, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is much more difficult to control than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
The onset of illness in congregations often occurs in the same family, assembly or vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of traveling to or staying in Wuhan or other affected areas, or having contact with people or patients during the last two weeks before the onset of the disease.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without showing symptoms for longer than two weeks, and recovering patients who have been discharged from hospitals can carry the virus again, sending an alarm to increase quarantine time.
Patients have a normal or low number of peripheral white blood cells (particularly lymphocytes) in the early stage.
For example, lymphadenopathy was detected with a white blood cell count of 4<0xC3><0x97>109/L including a lymphocyte count of 1<0xC3><0x97>109/L, and elevated levels of amine-aspartate transporter and blood transfusion in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
Levels of liver, muscle and myoglobin enzymes in the blood of some patients increased, and the increase in C-reactive protein and the rate of red blood cirrhosis in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of Demer D, caused by fibrin cracking in the blood, increased and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
Imbalances in radiography appear in most COVID-19 patients and are characterized by double patch shades or blurred glass in the lungs.
Patients sometimes have atypical pneumonia, severe lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs, out-of-control inflammation, fluid buildup, and elevated fibrosis severely affect gas exchange.
The dysfunction of the lung cells type 1 and type 2 reduces the level of the surface activator and increases the surface tension, thus, reduces the ability of the lungs to stretch and increases the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the worst chest X-ray results and the maximum extent of the disease often converge.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed pulmonary cell exfoliation, hyalin membrane formation, interstitial lymphatic infiltration, and polynucleic cellular cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, in line with the pathology of viral infection and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The discovery of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through reverse transcription chain reaction polymerase (PT-PCR) has been used as a key criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false-negative outcomes, which may accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations of the diagnosis (which is no longer individually based on RT-PCR) began to be used in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation also occurred in the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiation imaging findings is essential for an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Chang Group described a protocol to use CRISPR-based Sherlock technology to detect SARS-CoV-2, detecting pieces of SARS-CoV-2-created RNA at a rate of 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10–18 milliseconds/l using 200 <0xC3><0x97> 10–18 millimeters/l (10–100 copies per <0xCE><0xBC>m input).
We hope that the new technology will be able to significantly improve sensitivity and suitability if verified in clinical samples.
Because of the lack of experience with the novel coronavirus, doctors are able to provide mainly supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while experimenting with a variety of treatments that have previously been used or suggested to treat other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, stimulants, plasma from recovering patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from recovering patients has been suggested for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and antiviral vaccines.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs initially, and may also attack, to a lesser extent, other organs that release the enzyme angiotensin-2 converter, such as the digestive system, intestines, and kidneys.
However, respiratory failure is the most serious threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is necessary to relieve symptoms and save lives, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen flow, non-invasive respirators, and invasive artificial respirators based on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a cardiac-pulmonary bypass technique used to treat heart failure or life-threatening respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining fluid balance, preventing and treating secondary infection and septic shock, and protecting vital organ function, are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Cytokine storm is known to result from an overreaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory reaction characterized by the release of a series of cytokines including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a huge number of free radicals and are the leading cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome and the failure of multiple organs.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially for acute patients.
Stimulant hormones, tocilizumab, and an anti-interleukin 6 monoclonal antibody have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive therapies for cytokine storm include T-cell-directed immune-reaction modulation; blockade of IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1, and TNF; Janus kinase inhibition; plinatomomab; cytokine 4 signal capacitors; and histone decitylase inhibitors.
Stimulants and immunosuppressants have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, larger-dose steroids were not helpful with severe lung injury in SARS and Covid-19 patients.
Instead, it can cause severe side effects, especially subvascular bone necrosis, which severely affects the prediction of disease progression.
However, short cycles of anabolic hormones at doses ranging from small to medium have been recommended with caution for critical COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no antiretroviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration of rimdesivir, a nucleotide isotope, was found to be effective in a U.S. COVID-19 patient.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral initially developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by the Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Later, Remdesivir also showed potential inhibition of other RNA-single-chain viruses, including MERS and SARS.
Based on these viruses, Gilliad presented the compound to China for some experiments on individuals with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, paracetamol, interferon-alpha, lupinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential treatments for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other adverse reactions can occur after blobinapine/ritonavir combination therapy.
The interaction of these therapies with other drugs used with patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovered patients and the generation of antibodies
Collecting blood from patients who have recovered from an infectious disease to treat other patients with the same disease or to prevent healthy individuals from getting the disease has a long history.
Indeed, recovering patients often have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (AGs) produced by B-lymphocytes to fight off pathogens and other foreign bodies, and they recognize and neutralize molecules unique to pathogens directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and injected in 10 patients with serious conditions.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation and viral loads and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary for this method to be put to widespread use before specific therapies can be reached.
In addition, due to the therapeutic effects, some plasma-related defects need to be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can trigger an over-stimulating immune reaction and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is high for the treatment of patients with critical conditions.
It is difficult to develop specific antibodies and produce them quickly enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, isolating B-cells from recovering patients and identifying genetic codes that encode effective antibodies, or screening for effective antibodies against the virus’s core proteins, is more decisive and practical.
This way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional Chinese medicine has been used to treat a variety of diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects are highly dependent on a combination of multiple components in a combination that vary depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on theories of traditional Chinese medicine.
Most active ingredients remain unknown or ambiguous as they are difficult to extract and verify for their optimal composition.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM has become an important alternative treatment for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, Xu Feng Ji Do and Lian Hua King Win capsules have been found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest cure rates in the treatment of COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces in China where traditional Chinese medicine was used in 87% of its patients, including Ganzhou (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, which used traditional Chinese medicine with only about 30% of its COVID-19 patients, had the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is a very rough comparison, as many other influencers, such as the number of patients and the severity of their cases, should be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Polly Zhang and his co-workers published a study comparing the treatment of Western Medicine (WM) alone with the treatment of the combination of Western Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine.
They found that the time needed to recover from hyperthermia, de-symptoms, and hospital stays was much shorter in the Western Medicine <0x2B> Traditional Chinese Medicine group than in the Western Medicine only group.
Most impressively, the aggravation rate of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the Western Medicine <0x2B> TCM group compared to the Western Medicine only group (7.4% vs. 46.2%), and the mortality rate was lower in the Western Medicine <0x2B> TCM group compared to the Western Medicine only group (8.8% vs. 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of traditional Chinese medicine still await more well-studied trials at larger scales and in more centers.
It will also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of procedures and clarify the active ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine treatments or their formulations if possible.
Patients suspected of or confirmed to have COVID-19 often have a severe fear of a highly contagious and even fatal illness, and people under quarantine are bored, lonely, and angry.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, and cough, as well as the negative effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by anabolic hormones, can lead to more anxiety and mental disorder.
In the first phase of the SARS outbreak, a range of mental illnesses were reported including permanent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidal tendencies.
Compulsory contact tracing and quarantine, as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people more concerned and guilty about the effects of infection, quarantine, and stigmatization of their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, persons suspected of contracting it, persons in contact with them, as well as the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the creation of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear contacts with regular and accurate updates on SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and treatment plans, and the use of specialized electronic devices and applications to avoid direct contact with each other.
Effective vaccines to cut the chain of transmission of the virus from infected animal and human reservoirs to susceptible hosts are essential and often complementary to antiviral therapy in the fight against epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-based vaccines to generate neutral, effective, long-range antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live attenuated vaccines were evaluated in animal models for the treatment of SARS.
However, the effectiveness of these in vivo vaccine candidates in older adults and fatal challenge models and in their prevention of animal source virus infection has not been determined prior to the start of a clinical study.
This is probably because SARS vanished 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
By contrast, sporadic MERS cases and groups continue to emerge in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the continued presence of animal sources in endemic areas.
Immunization strategies were developed against Mears using inactive virus, deoxyribonucleic acid plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and recombinant protein subunits, some of which were evaluated in animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and critical task for controlling the ongoing epidemic.
However, overcoming the difficulty is challenging because of the length of time (average 18 months) needed to develop a vaccine and the dynamic changes of the coronaviruses.
COVID-19, as an emerging disease, has just begun to show its full clinical course through thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually without punishment.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with high prevalence rates and mortality in severe patients.
Therefore, building a disease-prognosis model is necessary for health-care agencies to prioritize their services, especially in resource-limited areas.
Based on clinical studies reported to date, the following factors may affect or be associated with predictions of disease progression in COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in determining the progression of SARS, which also applies to COVID-19.
The 30-65-year-olds were mainly infected with COVID-19, with 47.7% of these patients exceeding the age of 50 in a study of 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care were much more likely to develop underlying comorbidities and complications and were much older than those who did not (at the average age of 66 vs. 51), indicating age as a predictive factor for the results of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidities and Complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart injuries and arrhythmias.
Cardiac accidents were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to positive bile cells with angiotensin-2 converting enzyme, which may lead to liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and underlying disease are strongly related and may overlap with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury, and was suggested to be a predictive factor for disease, response to treatment, and final recovery.
The association between the level of C-reactive protein and the severity of COVID-19 disease and its progression predictions has also been suggested.
In addition, high levels of Lactate-hydrogenated enzyme (LDH), aspartate-aminotransferase (AST), alanine-aminotransferase (ALT) enzyme (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes appear strongly in many organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional signs of dysfunction in the heart or liver.
Key Clinical Symptoms: Chest X-rays and progress of clinical symptoms should be considered together with other problems to predict the outcome of COVID-19 and its complications.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as an adjuvant treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since the high dose of anabolic hormones is widely used in SARS patients, many survivors have suffered from anaerobic osteochondrosis with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, steroids should be used at a low dose and for a short time in patients with COVID-19, if necessary.
Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients experienced exceptional stress; they often endured prolonged periods of quarantine, extreme uncertainty, and witnessed the death of close family members and sick colleagues.
It is essential to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help those patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological features than SARS.
In addition to lower respiratory reincarnation, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively reincarnate in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms at the early stage of infection, similar to other coronaviruses that cause common colds.
Therefore, infected patients in the early stage or incubation period can produce a large amount of the virus during daily activities, causing difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission is considered to occur when patients are in a severe condition, while most of the virus transmissions did not occur in the early stage.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Strenuous efforts are underway in China, including the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the ongoing quarantine of almost the entire population in the hope of hindering the SARS-CoV-2 transition.
Although these measures have hit the economy and other sectors of the country hard, the number of new patients is declining, signaling a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the receding phase will continue for 3 to 4 months.
However, some other experts are not as optimistic.
Paul Hunter and others have estimated that COVID-19, which looks far more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini et al. created a model for predicting the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could affect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in medium and throat oyster swabs of patients who had recovered and left the hospital two weeks earlier, suggesting that the newly discovered virus could become a periodic flu-like seizure.
Nevertheless, promising signs have emerged in China based on the declining number of new cases, suggesting that current strategies may have worked.
Ebola was originally expected to cause up to 1 million cases with half a million deaths.
However, the disease was eventually controlled by strict quarantine and isolation measures.
Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can become weaker in terms of causing infection and eventually disappear or become a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 pandemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics is given below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted at a higher rate through coughing or sneezing, and can also be transmitted through direct contact with HIV-contaminated substances.
The virus has also been found in the stool, raising a new possibility of passing from the stool to the mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may have been caused by hospital infections, including 17 patients with other pre-existing diseases and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, great precautions need to be taken to protect human beings, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even bystanders who have communicated with patients or infected people.
Wearing face masks is the first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series 1860s) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical face masks prevent fluid droplets from a potential person from moving through the air or sticking to the surfaces of the material, where they can be passed on to others.
However, only N95 (series 1860s) masks can protect against inhaling small virions as much as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of virions able to penetrate fully; they are similar in size to SARS-CoV-2 SARS-CoV and each approximately 85 nm in size.
Since particles can penetrate up to five surgical masks combined, healthcare providers who directly contact patients should wear N95 masks (Series 1860s) but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare providers should wear appropriate isolation robes to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear transparent face protectors or glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash their hands with antiseptic soap more often than usual, try to stay at home for self-quarantine and limit communication with potentially infected individuals.
Three feet is a good distance to keep people away from the patient.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came as a new virus to the human world, its close resemblance to SARS-CoV as reported on January 7, 2020 would have caused a high alert in China based on its deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control did not reassure citizens until January 19, 2020, saying that the new virus has a low infection rate and limited human-to-human reproduction and there is no problem in preventing and containing the disease.
This message drastically reduced the public's alertness, especially as the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and a critical time was lost to contain the disease at its lowest range in Wuhan.
China’s disease control agencies may benefit from this harsh lesson and implement substantial improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more cautious when issuing public statements because each word is important to citizens and can change their behavior and decisions; (2) more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive to contain a potential epidemic in its early stages and to improve the public's response, rather than trying to reassure the public; and (4) more rehearsal.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 began at the end of December 2019.
It has spread in less than two months across China and around 50 other countries around the world at the time of writing.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has triggered a sense of SARS recurrence.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are necessary to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than younger people and men more than women, and the rate of severity and mortality is also higher in older people than in younger people.
SARS has a higher death rate than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they have no symptoms, while SARS patients usually do this when they are severely ill, causing greater difficulty in containing the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
Normal SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing can be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovering patients can become infected with the virus again.
These results significantly increase the risk of the virus spreading.
With this rapid advance in research on COVID-19, many critical issues remain to be resolved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Despite the discovery of a 96% genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 in bats, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
What animal was the intermediate type that transmitted the virus from the original host, such as bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to digits 1 and 2, we cannot stop the transition efficiently, and the outbreak could return at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical testing have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to the enzyme converting to angiotensin-2, how exactly does the virus enter the airway cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells that secrete the enzyme converting ACE-2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot make a quick and accurate diagnosis and offer an effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically as it is transmitted between humans?
Is it going to become a global pandemic, or is it fading like SARS, or is it coming back periodically like the flu?
It is necessary but may take some time to search for answers to the above questions and many other questions.
However, at whatever cost it may take, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and restore our lives to normalcy.
Animal origins of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have been driving the co-evolution of coronaviruses and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two types of human coronaviruses (human coronaviruses) were known to cause mild illness, such as a cold.
The outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have shown the other side to reveal how severe and life-threatening human coronavirus infections can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in Central China at the end of 2019 has led to a re-emergence of coronaviruses, and surprised us how quickly it spreads but with the ability to cause the disease compared to his brother SARS-CoV.
Human coronavirus is an animal disease of origin so our understanding of the animal origins of human coronaviruses would serve us well.
Most human coronaviruses come from bats where they were non-pathogenic.
The intermediate repository hosts of some human coronaviruses have also been identified.
The identification of host animals has a direct impact on the prevention of human diseases.
The investigation of the interactive relationships between the coronavirus and the host in animals also provides an important insight into the emergence of the coronavirus disease in humans.
In this review, we provide an overview of the information available about the seven human coronaviruses, focusing on the history of their discovery as well as their animal origins and interspecies transmission.
Most importantly, we compare and differentiate different human coronaviruses from the perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination.
In this context, the disease caused by the current coronavirus pandemic 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed.
In addition, it also highlights the successful switching requirements of the host and the impact of complications of virus development on the severity of the disease.
Corona viruses belong to the coronavirus family, which includes a group of encapsulated viruses with single-directional RNA.
These viruses contain the largest genome of RNA viruses with 26 to 32 kilobases and are called "coronaviruses" by that name because their structure resembles a crown under an electron microscope.
In terms of synthetic properties, coronaviruses contain undivided genomes that share similar regulation.
Nearly two-thirds of the genome contains two large interlaced open reading templates (ORF1a and ORF1b), which convert to the polyclonal protein types pp1a and pp1ab.
Multiple proteins are additionally treated to generate 16 non-structural proteins, referred to as nsp1<0x7E>16.
The remaining part of the genome contains open reading templates for structural proteins, including spike (S), casing (E), membrane (M) and nuclear protein (N).
Different strains of coronaviruses also encode a number of additional proteins from special strains.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, coronaviruses are classified into four types (Corona Alpha, Corona Beta, Corona Gamma, and Corona Delta), among which are the types of Corona Beta virus that include most human coronaviruses and are divided into four strains (A, B, C, and D).
Evidence of genetic evolution has shown that bats and rodents act as the genetic origins of most alpha-coronaviruses and beta-coronaviruses, while birds are the main repository of gamma-coronaviruses and delta-coronaviruses.
Over thousands of years, coronaviruses have consistently crossed species barriers, some of which have emerged as causes of serious human diseases.
To date, seven human coronaviruses (human coronaviruses) are known.
Among them are the human coronavirus 229E and the human coronavirus-NL63, both of which belong to the alpha coronaviruses.
The other five beta-coronaviruses include Human Corona-OC43, Human Corona-HKU1, SARS-CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-associated Corona Virus (MERS-COV) and SARS-CoV-2.
Human Corona Virus-229E, Human Corona Virus-OC43, Human Corona Virus-HKU1, and Human Corona Virus-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as a cold, diarrhea, or both.
By contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are all highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory infections in more patients with a higher risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and nonpulmonary symptoms.
Human coronavirus 229E, the first strain B814, was isolated from nasal discharge of patients with a cold in the mid-1960s.
Much of the information has since been collected through extensive studies of the human coronavirus-229E and the human coronavirus-OC43, whose symptoms are automatically cured.
In fact, it was generally accepted that infection with human coronaviruses was harmless until the SARS outbreak.
The 2003 SARS outbreak is among the deadliest in our present history, with more than 8,000 cases and an approximate mortality rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak created a static epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The 2019 novel human coronavirus (HIV-2019), renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the current pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people on March 3, 2020.
The alarm bell is ringing and the world must prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses have animal origins from bats, mice, or pets.
Multiple evidence supports that the evolutionary origins of all human coronaviruses are from bats, where the viruses are well adapted, not pathogenic, but show significant genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has posed enormous medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges to China and the world.
Tracing the animal origins of human coronaviruses has shown a framework for understanding natural history, the driving force and limiting factors of interspecies mobility.
This may also guide or facilitate the search for the repository, intermediate host, and inflated host animal (inflated host animals) of SARS-CoV-2, with important effects to prevent future fallout.
In this review we provide an overview of animal origins, interspecies transmission, and the cause of human coronaviruses in diseases.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common belief that native human coronaviruses are usually non-pathogenic in their natural repository hosts but become pathogenic after they move between species to a new host.
We also review the evaluation of the course of the human coronavirus where the increase in its transmissibility is often accompanied by a decrease in the severity of the pathogenesis.
We also discuss in this context the results of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the B814 strain of HPV-229E was first isolated from nasal secretions of patients with a cold, various types of coronaviruses were isolated from various infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
In the past decades, seven types of human coronaviruses have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of the human coronavirus in chronological order (Table 1) would be educational and instructive.
The first strain of HPV-229E was isolated from the respiratory system for patients with upper respiratory infections in 1966, after which it adapted to live in the ranks of WI-38 lung cells.
Patients with HCoV-229E have common cold symptoms, including headaches, sneezing, malaise, and sore throat, with fever and cough in about 10<0x7E>20% of cases.
Later in 1967, the human coronavirus-OC43 was isolated from the organ farm and subsequent transmission was in the brains of the infant mice.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which are indistinguishable by symptoms from infection with other respiratory viruses such as influenza A viruses and nasal viruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 have spread globally, and tend to travel during the winter season in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation time of these viruses is less than one week, followed by a feeling of illness for about two weeks.
According to a human voluntary study, the infection of healthy individuals with the human coronavirus 229E has caused a mild cold.
Only a few immunodeficiency patients showed severe lower respiratory infection.
SARS, also known as “atypical pneumonia,” is the first well-documented human coronavirus pandemic in human history and was caused by SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus to be discovered.
The first case of SARS goes back to late 2002 in China’s Guangdong Province.
The SARS epidemic has resulted in 8,096 confirmed cases and 774 deaths, and has spread across many countries and continents.
Regardless of the superconductor, it has been estimated that one case can lead to almost two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the peak viral load appearing on the 10th day of the disease.
The onset of SARS-CoV symptoms begins with muscle pain, headache, fever, malaise, and chills, followed by late symptoms of difficulty breathing, coughing and respiratory distress.
Lack of lymphocytes, impaired liver function, and elevated creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities for SARS.
In patients with SARS, diffuse analgesia, the proliferation of virtual cells, and an increase in the number of phagocytic cells are also observed.
About 20-30% of patients then require intensive care and artificial respiration.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, in severe cases many organs, including the digestive tract, liver and kidneys, can also be infected and are usually accompanied by a cytokine storm that can be especially fatal in immunodeficiency patients.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of the first case who traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, huge efforts have been devoted to research on the human coronavirus.
The human coronavirus NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to be common in young children, the elderly, and immunodeficiency patients with respiratory diseases.
Colds, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchitis are common symptoms of the disease caused by the human coronavirus NL63.
Another independent study described isolating the virus itself from a sample of the nose of an 8-month-old child with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was discovered in the Netherlands, it is widespread worldwide.
It is estimated that the human coronavirus NL63 is responsible for approximately 4.7 percent of common respiratory diseases, peaking during early summer, spring and winter.
The human coronavirus NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as choking.
In the same year, HKV-1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchitis, human coronavirus-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with exacerbation of acute asthma attacks.
Human coronavirus (HKU1) has been found to be widespread worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases, similar to the HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43.
All four of these community-acquired human coronaviruses have adapted well to humans and, in general, the likelihood that they mutate to cause diseases with high rates of spread is low, but the coincidence occurred for unknown reasons as in the rare case of the more ferocious subtype of human coronavirus-NL63, which has recently been reported to cause a severe lower respiratory tract infection in China.
In general, when these coronaviruses gain the ability to transmit efficiently and maintain themselves consistently within humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
Mears-Cove was first isolated in 2012 from a 60-year-old patient with pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most of the laboratory-confirmed cases originate in the Middle East, in many European countries and Tunisia cases brought in from abroad and a rare secondary transfer of contacts in close personal contact have been reported.
Another secondary outbreak in South Korea in 2015 resulted in 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical symptoms caused by MERS are similar to those caused by SARS, and are characterized by acute and worsening pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also suffered severe kidney failure, which is what distinguishes MERS from other diseases caused by the human coronavirus.
More than 30% of patients experience gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
On February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making Mears-Cove one of the most devastating viruses known to humans.
From mid-December to late-2019, groups of pneumonia patients were later identified as being caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the current outbreak of lower respiratory infections due to SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international concern, as it has been called COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with an initial mortality rate of 3.4%.
The death rate in Hubei Province, China, is 4.2 percent, while outside it is 1.2 percent.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and appears in the form of fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Diarrhea also appears in some infected people.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can quickly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the large homogeneity in the nucleotide sequence of 82%, they belong to different branches in the evolutionary tree.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less severe but more contagious compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
It has been reported that people who do not show symptoms despite SARS-CoV-2 infection may be contributing to its rapid spread around the world.
The comparison and contrast between SARS-CoV-2 and the other six human coronaviruses revealed similarities and differences of great importance.
First, human coronaviruses are similar in incubation period and disease time period.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 infection falls among the four human coronaviruses acquired from society (i.e., human coronavirus-229E, human coronavirus-OC43, human coronavirus-HKU1, and human coronavirus-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 has features that are more common in community-acquired human coronavirus cases, such as showing unspecified or minor symptoms or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen as in the case of SARS-CoV, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission shows interesting patterns for both the human coronaviruses acquired from society and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of human-acquired coronaviruses.
On the other hand, it remains to be ascertained whether the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after transmission to humans, as in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases.
Finally, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples as well as in other human coronaviruses.
Further studies are still needed in the future to clarify whether SARS-CoV-2 transmission from the oral anal route plays an important role as in the case of SARS-CoV at least in some cases.
It is worthwhile to consider whether SARS-CoV-2 may show seasonal spread as in cases of human-acquired coronaviruses.
However, SARS-CoV-2 traits, including transmissibility, pathogenesis mechanism and sustainable post-transition spread for humans will have an impact on the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
All four human coronaviruses acquired from society and causing minor symptoms have adapted well to humans.
Another perspective, which may also be true, is that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, they may both be survivors of the ancient human coronavirus epidemics.
Human coronaviruses, which affect people with severe diseases, as well as people with severe human coronavirus diseases, have been eliminated.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses in humans must be cloned sufficiently to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations that face the host’s limiting factors.
Based on this logic, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the greater the number of SARS-CoV-2 cases, the greater the chance that it will fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, it is difficult to stop its transmission between humans by quarantine or other infection control measures.
The four community-acquired coronaviruses have spread among human populations over many years, causing a cold in people with good immunity.
These viruses do not need an animal warehouse.
By contrast, the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV did not adapt well to humans, and were unable to continue the transition between humans.
They need to stay in and breed in their animal warehouses and then look for the right opportunity to move on to the most vulnerable human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate and amplified hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar traits to both SARS-CoV/Mers-CoV and the four human coronaviruses acquired from society.
It is highly contagious like human coronaviruses acquired from society, at least for the time being.
However, it causes the disease more than human coronaviruses acquired from the community and less than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It is not yet clear whether it will fully adapt to humans and spread among them without the need for a warehouse or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of human coronaviruses, it would be useful for us to review the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, repository, intermediate, and amplifier hosts of human coronaviruses.
The animal plays the role of the evolutionary host of the human coronavirus if it harbors the closely related virus of origin and shares a significant symmetry in the level of nucleotide sequences.
The native virus is usually well-adapted and non-pathogenic to this host.
Similarly, the repository hosts the human coronavirus continuously and over a long period of time.
In both cases, flight attendants become infected naturally and are the natural flight attendants of the human coronavirus or its parent virus.
By contrast, if the human coronavirus enters the newly intermediate host before or near its attack on humans, it does not adapt well to the new host and often causes morbidity.
This intermediate host can act as an animal source of human infection and also performs the role of an amplified host by allowing the virus to clone temporarily and then transmit it to humans to expand the spread of infection among humans.
The human coronavirus infection may reach a stalemate if the virus fails to transmit from within the intermediate host.
On the contrary, human coronaviruses can also adapt to the intermediate host and may even colonize it for a long time.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural warehouse host.
Epidemiological data later revealed that the first case of SARS had a history of contact with the game.
Seroproliferative surveys then indicated that animal traffickers had a higher prevalence rate of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to normal people.
For the first time, Paguma larvata and a raccoon dog in the live animal markets have been identified to carry SARS-CoV-like viruses roughly identical to SARS-CoV.
What indirectly supported this was the fact that no other case of SARS was reported after killing all the yogurt cats in the markets.
However, it has been reported that the result of SARS-CoV screening in masked palm yogurt living in the wild or on farms without exposure to live animal markets was largely negative, indicating that the masked palm yogurt may be only an intermediate amplified host, but not the natural repository of SARS-CoV.
Noting that since 80% of different animals in the Guangzhou markets have SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that multiple species of small mammals also play the role of SARS-CoV’s amplified intermediate host is not excluded.
It seems that all of these are hosts who do not transfer SARS-CoV.
Later research on the animal natural host of SARS-CoV led to the detection of the closely related bat coronavirus, which is called the reddish Chinese horseshoe bat virus associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (HKU3).
The SARS-CoV antibody test in these bats and the HKU3-associated reddish-shovel virus genome sequencing were positive.
This virus and other bat coronaviruses share 88-92% nucleotide sequences with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are host to emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SARS-like coronaviruses) were identified from bats, but none could be isolated as a live virus except WIV1.
The human angiotensin-2-converting enzyme (angiotensin-2-converting enzyme) is known as the receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 extracted from a bat stool sample was shown to use the enzyme converting to angiotensin 2 in bats, yogurt cats, and humans as a receptor for cell entry.
Interestingly, the serum recovered from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome had the ability to equate WIV1.
To date, WIV1 is the virus most associated with SARS-CoV in bats, as they share 95% nucleotide sequences.
Despite the high symmetry between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct parent virus of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the direct host repository of SARS-CoV.
Analysis of the evolution of the Mirs-Koff strains in the coronavirus-HKU4 group in bats and the coronavirus-HKU5 in bats themselves.
Corona-HKU4 virus is used in bats and Meurs-Cove host receptor itself, dipeptide peptides4 (dipeptide peptides4), to enter the virus.
MERS-CoV RNA-based polymerase sequences are closer in terms of the evolution of strains to their counterparts of beta-coronaviruses in bats identified in Europe and Africa.
It has not yet been discovered that Mears-Cove lives in wild bats.
Mers-Coffee and the HKU25 virus in its closest bat share only 87% nucleotide sequences.
Thus, bats may not be the direct repository of Mears-Cove.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that the only serous-positive camels are the equivalent antibodies of Mears-Cove, as well as camels of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries.
The living Mears-Cove virus found in humans was isolated from nasal swabs of single-hump camels, indicating that camels act as the host of the original Mears-Cove reservoir.
It is also worth noting that minor symptoms generally appeared in camels that were experimentally infected with Mears-Cove, but heavy viral scattering was observed.
Infected camels were remarkably spreading viruses not only through breathing but also through the oral anal route, which is the primary route of spreading the virus from bats.
However, questions remain because many confirmed MERS cases have no history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, and these cases have been attributed in terms of logic to human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission routes involving unidentified species of animals that harbor MERS-Cove.
SARS-CoV-2 is involved in isolated bats from horseshoe bats in 96.2% nucleotide symmetry.
The sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is so long that it is difficult to determine the relationship to the father, as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
This means that bats may not be the direct host(s) of SARS-CoV-2 unless the coronaviruses of bats are found to be nearly identical in the future.
SARS-CoV-2 intermediate hosts are presumed to be among the wild animal species sold and killed at the Wuhan Seafood Market, which has been linked to several initial cases of COVID-19, suggesting a possible animal-to-human transmission.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequences have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as manis javanica can also harbor beta-coronaviruses associated with SARS-CoV-2.
These new ant-eating coronavirus genomes and SARS-CoV-2 share 85-92% nucleotide sequences.
However, they are closely related to RATG13 with about 90% similarity at the level of nucleotide sequences.
It clusters in two subtypes of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the evolutionary tree, one of which shares a similar receptor binding field (receptor binding field) with SARS-CoV-2, with the amino acid sequence matching 97.4%.
In stark contrast, SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domains are significantly different from RATG13, although the entire genome sequencing is higher.
A previous study of a sick squamous ant eater also revealed the presence of viral organisms from lung samples, and it turned out that they are similarly associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted various collection and manual processing methods to generate a partial genome sequence consisting of the full-length viral genome by approximately 86.3%.
We cannot rule out the possibility that the squamous ant-eater is one of the intermediate host animals of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support that the squamous ant eater is the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to the variation of the sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-associated beta-coronaviruses in the squamous ant eater.
In addition, the spacing between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is lower than the spacing between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-associated beta-coronaviruses in squamous ant eaters.
The evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, squamous ant-eaters, and other mammals is still in the process of being identified.
While the highest sequence symmetry has been found in the areas of receptor binding between SARS-CoV-2 and squamous ant-eater, the beta-coronaviruses associated with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest symmetry of complete genome sequencing.
It is a predominant speculation that the high degree of similarity between SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domains in beta-coronavirus squamous ant-eaters and SARS-CoV-2 is guided by selective convergent evolution.
There is a counter-proposal that suggests recombination between SARS-CoV-2 in beta-coronavirus squamous ant-eaters and RaTG13 in terrestrial animal species.
Recombination is widespread among beta-coronaviruses as a driving force for evolution.
The direct animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been confirmed.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, the animal origin of the human coronavirus-229E, the human coronavirus-OC43, the human coronavirus-NL63, and the human coronavirus-HKU1 has also been studied.
Evidence for the evolution of strains has suggested that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat coronaviruses, while HCoV-OC43 and HKU1 viruses have been found in rodents.
It has been reported that the coronavirus in bats called ARCoV.2 (Applash Heights Corona Virus) detected in tricolor bats in North America is closely related to the human coronavirus NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was found to be genetically linked to another coronavirus in bats, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, and camels were suspected to be also its intermediate host.
To illustrate, the current information on the animal origins of known human coronaviruses is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Analysis of the evolution of strains has provided evidence of cases of human coronavirus transmission between species throughout history.
When the human coronavirus OC43 crossed species to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890, the respiratory infection epidemic was recorded.
The history of HPV-229E transmission between species is still less clear.
Alpha-coronaviruses in bats have been found to be closely related to HCoV-229E.
There is an alpha-coronavirus in the alpaca.
Many evidence supports the transmission of the virus from bats to humans directly.
First, humans, not alpacas, may have contact with bats in a common habitat.
Humans have a close connection to alpaca.
Second, the human coronavirus-229E in bats is multiple and non-pathogenic in bats, while the alpaca virus causes respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alpaca-associated coronavirus has not been detected in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that the alpaca has been infected with human coronavirus-229E from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of viruses that cause diseases in humans including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nibah virus, and Hendra virus.
So it’s no surprise that bats may transmit the human coronavirus 229E directly to humans.
While alpha-coronaviruses in bats act as a aggregation of the genes for the human coronavirus-229E, alpacas and single-hump camels may act as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, just as in Mears-Cove.
Mears-Cove gives an excellent example of interspecies transmission as it moves from bats to single-hump camels and from single-hump camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of Mears-Kouf from bats has been known since the beginning of their identification and has also been reinforced by subsequent results.
It is clear that bats provide a rich collection of viruses to exchange genetic pieces within a species and transfer them between species.
Bats are characterized by longevity, living in overcrowded colonies, close social interaction, and a strong ability to fly, all of which are favorable conditions to make them an ideal “virus distributor.”
Mears-Cove, on the other hand, has moved on to solitary camels for decades.
These camels may have adapted well until they switched from an intermediate host to a natural, stable warehouse host.
Mears-Cove causes very minor disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its intermittent transmission to humans remains coincidental and man is a non-conveyor host for Mears-Cove where it cannot continue.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of Mears-Cove, the role of ant-eating squash, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, the beta-coronaviruses associated with squamous ant-eating make it very sick.
They may be non-carrier hosts for SARS-CoV-2, similar to the yogurt cat in the case of SARS-CoV.
Future studies will resolve many possibilities for SARS-CoV-2 transmission between species from animals to humans by either proving it or excluding it.
First, bats may be the host of a reservoir of a SARS-CoV-2-associated virus, which is mostly identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans and bats may share the habitat through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, the squamous ant eater could be one of the intermediate amplified hosts of the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2-associated virus.
Humans become infected with the virus by slaughtering and consuming game meat.
Many mammals, including pets, are likely to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A screening of antibodies in domestic and wild animals is warranted.
Third, as mentioned above, SARS-CoV-2 recombination and adaptation may have occurred in a third type that has contact with bats and termite eaters.
The search for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
Apart from the different types of animal hosts, on the viral side there are three main factors that are also important in facilitating infection with coronaviruses to overcome species barriers.
First, mutation rates are relatively high in RNA doubling.
The estimated mutation rates of coronaviruses, compared to those of other single-chain RNA viruses, can be considered "medium" or "high" with an average conversion rate of <0x7E>10-4 site-to-site conversions per year, depending on the stage of adaptation of the coronavirus to the new hosts.
Corona viruses include the externally corrective enzyme ribonuclease, which causes its deletion to be highly mutable and attenuated or unable to evolve.
Interestingly, the nucleotide isotope remdecifer is known for its ability to suppress the coronavirus by inhibiting external ribonucleases and RNA-based polymerases.
Rimdecifer is one of the precursors of SARS-CoV-2, which is to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the rates of coronavirus mutations are about a million times higher than the rates of flight attendants.
In addition, the mutation rate is often high when coronaviruses do not adapt appropriately to the host.
The mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly lower when compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, which indicates a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It seems that he has already adapted to another host close to the human.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to the Mers-CoV, which has adapted well to single camels.
In theory, genetic aberration is unlikely to help vaccines and antiviral drugs resist SARS-CoV-2 by rapidly weakening its effectiveness.
Second, the large RNA genome in coronaviruses actively provides additional plasticity in modifying the genome for mutations and recombination, thereby increasing the likelihood of interspecies co-evolution, which is useful for the emergence of new coronaviruses when conditions become favorable.
This is powered by uniquely abundant open reading templates and encoded protein functions near the 3<0xE2><0x80><0xB2> end of the genome.
Third, coronaviruses randomly and repeatedly switch templates during RNA transcription through a unique “copy selection” mechanism.
In a host that is like a mixing vessel, sequencing switches occur frequently during transcription of the RNA of the coronavirus.
Highly symmetrical full-length RNAs and secondary genomics may recombine to generate new coronaviruses.
Evidence for the evolution of strains of natural recombination in human coronavirus-HKU1 and human coronavirus-OC43, as well as in animal coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in bats and in bats, has been found.
Interaction of the virus with the host associated with the transmission
In addition to the three aforementioned viral factors, viral interaction with the host receptor is another major factor influencing interspecies transmission.
In this regard, we consider the recombination of SARS-CoV as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during inter-species transition accidents.
Based on the comparative analysis of isolated samples of SARS-CoV in humans and civet cats, SARS-CoV was thought to undergo rapid adaptation in different hosts, particularly through mutations in the receptor binding field of the S protein.
In general, the field of S-coronavirus receptor binding interacts with the cellular receptor and is heavily selected by the host's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, the receptor binding field occurs in amino acids 318 to 510 in S1, which is associated with angiotensin-2-converting enzyme as well as adjuvant receptors to enter the virus.
The SARS-CoV receptor binding field is able to recognize the receptors for the enzyme converting angiotensin-2 adjuvant in various animals, including bat, yogurt cat, mouse and raccoon dog, which allows the virus to be transmitted between species.
In fact, only the remains of 6 amino acids were observed that were different from the virally isolated samples from humans and froth cats in the receptor binding domain, and 4 of them were found in the receptor binding sequencing pattern to interact with the angiotensin-2-converting enzyme receptor.
Mutations K479N and S487T are found in the field of SARS-CoV receptor binding in the yogurt cat, which can increase the likelihood of the spike protein interacting in the human ACE-2 receptor.
In other words, these two types of amino acid substitutes may be crucial for viral adaptation in humans.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor found in SARS-CoV.
There is a 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 in S1 protein, implying that the likelihood of S protein binding to human ACE-2 has changed.
Indeed, a study with ultra-cold electron microscopy indicated a 10- to 20-fold higher likelihood of this association than that occurring between the human enzyme converter Angiotensin 2 and the SV-SARS-CoV protein.
It is also interesting to determine whether any other type of assistive receptor may be necessary for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
It is also interesting that the human coronavirus-NL63 is also associated with the enzyme converting to angiotensin 2 but in a different part of the protein S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as the N-protein analyzer for HCoV-229E, and the 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCOV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans after the interspecies transition from their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the outcome of interspecies transmission of human coronaviruses is also controlled by other factors of host dependency and limitations.
The proliferation of these host proteins between humans and natural hosts of coronaviruses, such as bats, camels and toothpicks, and rodents can be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
Human coronaviruses need to control their host dependency factors and weaken their restriction factors to carry out successful interspecies transmission.
In this regard, the molecular determinants in this important space for the virus to interact with the host remain detectable and identifiable.
Extensive, unbiased genomic screening can be used to investigate the reliability and host limitations of SARS-CoV-2 using advanced CRISPR technology.
The Emergence of Human Corona Viruses: Back to the Starting Point
The diversity of coronaviruses in bats offers abundant opportunities for the emergence of novel human coronaviruses.
Based on this logic, the coronaviruses in bats are a genetic complex of human coronaviruses.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of the human coronavirus, two important points in the process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein encoding genes involves the ability to significantly modify viral phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV regulatory proteins, ORF8 was believed to be important in adapting to humans, as SARS-CoV was isolated from viruses in bats but was found to encode disparate ORF8 proteins.
The 29 nucleotide deletion properties of SARS-CoV were found to be found in isolated strains at the beginning of the human pandemic.
This deletion has divided ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes flight attendant switching.
Additionally, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombination through strains of alpha and gamma coronaviruses, where a large number of small recombination zones have been identified in RNA-based RNA polymerases.
Recombination sites have also been identified in nsp9, most nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, research has shown that the Mears-Cove epidemic has seen recombination cases between different strains, which occurred in the only camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination cases were also observed in other human coronaviruses, where human coronaviruses were combined with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It should be noted that artificial selection can also help unintentional changes in the viral genome, most of which are most likely caused by viruses getting rid of selective stressors, such as that caused by the host’s immune system.
The loss of full-length ORF4 protein in the human coronavirus-229E phenotype strain due to the deletion of two nucleotides is an example of these effects.
Although proper ORF4 can be observed in camel and bat viruses associated with HCoV-229E, the alpaca-alpha virus exhibits a single nucleotide stitch, leading to a frame-dropping mutation.
Last but not least, the evolution of new coronaviruses is also driven by selective pressure in their repository hosts.
Unsymptoms or mild symptoms have only been detected when bats are infected with coronaviruses, indicating mutual adaptation between the coronaviruses and bats.
It showed that bats adapted appropriately to coronaviruses anatomically and physiologically.
For example, poor activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats has effectively reduced the pathogens provoked by coronaviruses.
In addition, natural killer cell activity in bats was suppressed due to an increased rate of NKG2/CD94 inhibitory natural killer cell receptor and a low expression level of the key tissue compatibility complex class I molecules.
Furthermore, the high level of reactive oxygen complexes (reactive oxygen complexes) arising from the high metabolic activity of bats can both suppress the transcription of the coronavirus and influence the correction by external ribonuclease, thus providing selective pressure for highly pathogenic strains of the virus to emerge when a new host is infected.
Additional pathogenic strains of the coronavirus may arise by recombination, which leads to the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt to the host.
Accordingly, it is no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have emerged in the past two decades.
Corona viruses are not pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in depot flight attendants such as bats and camels.
They clone strongly without triggering a strong immune response from the host.
Here are the secrets that explain why HIV-positive people do not show symptoms and the causes of acute cases in human infections.
Acute symptoms are mainly caused by an overactive immune response and a cytokine storm where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in the case of carriers of the disease without symptoms, the immune response separates from the transcription of the coronavirus.
A similar strategy for the detachment of the immune response may have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, taking interferon type I can be used at least in the initial stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, the activation of the inflammatory particulate matter (NLRP3) in bats is weak.
With this mental logic, the inhibition of the inflammatory particulate matter (NLRP3) with the MCC950 inhibitor is beneficial in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general idea with which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated.
While SARS-CoV was found to be involved in 95% nucleotide homogenization in bats, there was also a 96% nucleotide homogenization in bats.
While civet cats and other animals on the market have been found to harbor SARS-CoV-like viruses, they have not detected SARS-CoV-2 intermediate direct hosts.
Beta-coronaviruses have been detected in squamous ant-eaters that are highly homogenous with SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that squamous ant-eaters may be one of the intermediate hosts or that the beta-coronaviruses in squamous ant-eaters have contributed to genetic fragmentation, which led to the final release of SARV-2.
Although questions are still on the table, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is man-made, either intentionally or by accident.
Coronaviruses have returned to the spotlight because of the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has dramatically changed our idea of the importance of the origins of animal diseases and animal repositories of human coronaviruses in human transmission.
Crucial evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 all originated from bats and were transmitted to humans via intermediate flight attendants.
Based on the fact that SARS-CoV infection arose from the contact between humans and yogurt cats in the markets, the closure of the fresh produce markets and the killing of yogurt cats were supposed to effectively end the SARS epidemic.
By the same logic, squamous ant-eating animals should be discarded from the markets for fresh products to prevent transmission of the disease of animal origin, in light of the discovery of multiple beta-coronavirus lineages in squamous ant-eating animals that are very close to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans or not, as well as how it is transmitted, through squamous ant-eating animals and other mammals, its transmission remains a topic that needs to be clarified in future research.
Mears-Cove, on the other hand, has been found in solitary camels for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transportation and are a major source of meat, milk, skin, and wool products for locals.
It is widely spread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
So it is impossible to sacrifice all the camels to control Mears, just as officials in China’s wildlife markets have done to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurring outbreaks of Mears, a comprehensive approach should be taken to developing effective Mears-Cove vaccines for camels, as well as other infection control measures.
Because we are unable to completely eliminate these viruses, new genetic patterns may arise and cause outbreaks.
There are a variety of coronaviruses associated with animal diseases in wildlife.
In particular, coronaviruses are extremely diverse in bats that have the potential to cause diseases of animal origin.
There are many opportunities for the emergence and recombination of animal-associated coronaviruses, leading to the emergence of newer, more transmissible and/or deadly coronaviruses in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals should be abandoned in some places in China to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the face of human suffering caused by SARS, MERS and COVID-19, an appropriate preparedness and response plan should be prepared.
The fact is that a lot of viruses have taken their place on the planet for a very long time.
They live in their own natural repositories until they have a chance to spread and multiply.
Although bats carry many characteristics that suggest the spread of viruses, the chance of human contact with bats and other wild animal species can be reduced if humans adopt a culture that obliges them to stay away from them.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is a necessary measure to gain a better understanding of the environment of coronaviruses and their natural hosts, which proves useful in preventing their transmission from animals to humans and preventing future emergences.
In conclusion, the best way to prevent animal-based viral diseases is to move away from the environmental positions of the natural reservoirs of animal-based pathogens.
The mystery of the origin of the animal-origin disease of SARS-CoV-2 is still surrounded by many questions that require an answer.
First, if bats transmit the SARS-CoV-2 virus to the squamous ant-eater, it is important to know what conditions are in place to share bats and squamous ant-eaters in a similar ecological location.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in the transmission of disease to humans, then the way in which humans communicate with them should be determined.
Third, if a third type of mammal plays the role of a true intermediate host, then it should be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and squamous ant eaters.
Finally, since many mammals, including pets, may be suspected of carrying SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental infection should be performed.
Whether the host is a bat, squamous ant-eater or other mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or parent viruses are expected to be identified from which they branch and which are almost identical to their natural hosts in the future.
Ongoing research in this area will reveal the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important measures to prevent and control COVID-19 in humans.
The need to update the criteria of “suspect case” and “confirmed case” when diagnosing COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team published a rapid guidance on the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 infection, which provided our experience and included relevant reference information to fight the pandemic globally.
Although COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and clinical practice, and diagnostic and treatment strategies are constantly updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidance and introduced the newest diagnostic criteria: “Suspected Case” and “Confirmed Case” according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines (version 7) issued by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (NCoV-2019), now officially known as the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) virus, became known as SARS-CoV-2.
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) described COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team drafted a fast-track guideline and published it online in the Journal of Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It has received a lot of attention since its publication.
Please note that although COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge gradually increases based on the results of ongoing research and clinical practice experiences; thus, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn) between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, issued seven versions in total with some contexts changing fundamentally.
Our guidance has now received a comment from Zhou and others, who have made a simple proposal to monitor scores based on a clinical trial.
Their efforts have added new guidance to our guidance as well as become a valuable reference for this pandemic around the world.
We support their great effort and express our appreciation.
However, their work also needs to be updated according to the latest COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment guidelines (7th trial version) and recent studies.
According to the 7th edition (March 3, 2020), the confirmation of the suspected case needs to combine any of the characteristics of epidemiological history with two of the elements of clinical manifestations to reach a comprehensive analysis, or needs to verify three of the elements of clinical manifestations in the absence of a clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history that includes travel to Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities that have reported cases of COVID-19 as early as, or stay at home, during the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) a history that includes contact with other SARS-CoV-2 cases (with positive DNA test results); (3) a history that includes contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from the city or two areas of the home.
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with characteristics demonstrated by imaging testing for COVID-19 infection; (3) the total number of white blood cells showing a normal, small, or low level of lymphocyte count in the early stage of onset of infection.
Diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on the suspected case involving any of the evidence of pathogen or serum reactions of the IgS-4 as follows: (1) positive for SARS-CoV-2 real-time equivalent PCR test; (2) higher homogeneity of the entire viral genome sequence with the known novel coronavirus characteristics; and (3) positive IgG-2 antibody test results for the IgM-type body.
In our opinion, the real-time polymerase chain reaction test for DNA in respiratory tract or blood samples was added to the second version (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020).
The discovery of pathogens in the blood sample was added to the fourth version (January 27, 2020) and the fifth version (February 8, 2020); then the manual of serum reactions was added to the seventh version.
These modifications have relied on the researchers’ ongoing work to design an ideal DNA detection toolkit for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples of respiratory tract including blood samples, which has increased the availability of different samples and supported the transfer of the positive result of the specific antibody to the criteria of confirmed cases.
In addition, there is growing evidence to caution us when dealing with patients with unusual symptoms and conditions that are not accompanied by symptoms.
Therefore, the content of Zhou et al.’s flow chart should be updated, as they rated a person without clinical symptoms as “low risk.”
The score monitoring system also needs to be validated in practice and additional clinical studies.
In conclusion, we hope to have access to more direct evidence and invite readers to provide us with their feedback.
To diagnose a “suspected case” and a “confirmed case”, we call for the latest guidance from home countries to be followed and adhere to.
Our team will also update our guidance in time to provide assistance.
Bangladesh registers five new deaths due to COVID-19, highest daily rate
Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day due to the virus.
The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) in Bangladesh reported that, as of yesterday, there were 114 active cases and 33 home-based recoveries.
17 deaths were recorded.
The director of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research, Dr. Mirjadi Sabrina Flora, reported at an online press conference that the deaths included four males and one female.
According to Dr. Mirjadi, there were two cases aged over 60, two between 51 and 60, and one between 41 and 50.
She also said two of the deaths were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11.
An official at a hospital told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saif Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Authority, who was being cared for at Kuwait Maitry Hospital.
Bangladesh’s Minister of Land Transport and Bridges, Obaid al-Qadir, said in an online video statement on Saturday that public transport would be halted longer than initially planned until Saturday.
The disruption of public transport initially began on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday 4 April.
The transport of basic commodities: medical products, fuel and food is still permitted.
The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in Bangladesh on 8 March for two people who had returned from Italy, as well as the wife of one of them.
All three had already recovered by 19 March.
SARS-CoV-2 infections exceed 1 million worldwide
Data released by Johns Hopkins University on Thursday indicated that the total number of cases of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has exceeded one million worldwide.
COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus has caused at least 52,000 deaths.
This serious development came on the same day that Malawi confirmed the first coronavirus infections, and the first death associated with it was recorded in Zambia.
North Korea claimed that, as of Thursday, it is one of the few countries that remains free of coronavirus infections.
The World Health Organization (WHO) reported 105,635 confirmed cases as of yesterday, including 79,332 in the 24 hours leading up to 10 a.m. CET (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
More than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the United States, with at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News, citing Johns Hopkins University data, reported more than 1,000 deaths in the United States on Wednesday caused by coronavirus infection.
Countries around the world have announced tougher measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city’s closure until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin has announced that salaries will continue to be paid to Russians without going to work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the national emergency by 15 days, with 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions, and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the cities of Mecca and Medina to be all day long, previously from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to impose a curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWayne announced that the state had extended the stay-at-home order until May 1.
Australia stores lower limits on toilet paper purchases per transaction
Australian retail chains Wallworth and Coles on Saturday and Sunday night tightened restrictions on the purchase of toilet paper to reduce it to two rolls of Wallworths and one roll of Coles stores per transaction at all branches nationwide.
Aldi's stores also identified one roll, on Monday.
These purchase restrictions were posted as messages at payment points in store chains and on their Facebook pages.
It has been reported that buyers have been stockpiling it due to concerns about COVID-19 in case people need to self-isolate.
Wallworths on Wednesday approved restrictions on the delivery of toilet paper to homes to become one roll per purchase order.
The changes came after previous restrictions passed by Wallworths on March 4 and Coles on March 5 allowed only four rolls to be purchased per transaction.
Coles Stores reported in its March 8 media release that despite the application of the four-roller restrictions, “many stores still sell everything they have within one hour of receiving it,” calling the order “unprecedented” and also calling it “unexpected” in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
Sales increased “substantially” last week, according to a Walworths store spokesman.
Costco’s Canberra store also determined last week that the amount allowed to buy them was two rolls.
To alleviate the shortfall, Coles Stores asked suppliers for larger rolls and increased the pace of delivery, Wallworths Stores asked for additional stock, while Aldi Stores made its stock available for special offers scheduled for Wednesday early.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase inventory, but local council restrictions on the timing of truck deliveries make it harder.
Production costs are expected to rise, as suppliers try to meet demand, with few special offers.
On Tuesday, Aldi stores announced that as a result of the early availability of inventory, some stores will not be able to provide a special Wednesday offer.
Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said in a report to News.com.au that stores fill stores every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a large commodity, which leads to a decrease in the amount of inventory in terms of numbers, and when sold out, leaves large empty spaces on the shelves, which enhances the feeling of shortage.
According to Russell Zimmerman, “Cole’s and Woolworths’ stores have the view that if there are too many goods on the shelves, and if products like toilet rolls and sterilizers can be bought and supplied in bulk, that might reduce panic.”
The company Who Gives a Crap, which produces recycled toilet paper, reported on Wednesday that its inventory was running out.
According to a report by News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, which produces Kleenex toilet wipes, and Solaris Pepper, which produces Sorrent wipes, have confirmed that they are working 24/7 to continue providing their products.
Domain.com, a real estate website, noted that some property sellers offer free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, while fewer auctions were held because buyers stopped working on the long Labor Day weekend.
Thursday’s edition of NT News, a daily publication in Darwin, included eight-page advertisements made so that they could be cut and used as toilet paper.
Stores were initially hesitant to impose restrictions, according to a report by ABC Australia on March 3, as stores said they had no plans to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that there is also a high demand for other products, including gags, sterilizers, dried goods, handwashing and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed on Sunday evening that a British online store called Okado limits toilet paper purchases to two 12-roller packets.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Wednesday that the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 - a disease caused by the acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 - has reached the level of the pandemic.
Although the word “pandemic” refers only to the extent of the disease, and not to the severity of specific cases, the World Health Organization (WHO) has noted the need to push governments to take the necessary measures:
“All countries can still change the trajectory of this epidemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: “If countries detect, screen, treat, isolate, track and rally people to the confrontation, they will be able to find and respond.”
“We are all very concerned about alarming levels of proliferation and risk, as well as alarming levels of inaction.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, the pandemic is “unprecedented.”
In a statement published by CNN in February, he stated, “No other respiratory virus has been tracked from the onset of the onset of the on-going global spread, other than the flu.”
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying: “We have never been exposed to a pandemic caused by a coronavirus.”
“And we’ve never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time.”
The new situation is described as a pandemic following the World Health Organization’s decision in January to declare an outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak: “The bottom line is that things are going to get worse.”
The Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide as of Thursday, and more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak in Wuhan, China, was identified in December 2019, declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020, and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, about 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in about 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The mortality rate in China was estimated at 4%, while globally it ranged from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The period between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiretroviral treatment.
Basic treatment is supportive and symptomatic treatment. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping people apart, monitoring, and self-isolation of suspected infections.
Authorities around the world are responding to this threat with travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk controls and facility closures.
This pandemic has led to severe global social and economic disruption, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political, and cultural events, and widespread supply shortages exacerbated by buying panic.
Schools and universities have closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world’s student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other people of East and Southeast Asian origin and appearance, and other areas where there have been significant cases of the virus.
As a result of reduced travel and closure rates for heavy industries, there has been a reduction in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in the city of Wuhan (the capital of Hubei province) in China reported a range of cases of pneumonia for an unknown cause on December 31, 2019, and the investigation began in early January 2020.
The cases are mostly related to the Wuhan seafood wholesale market, so the virus is believed to have animal origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that is closely related to the coronaviruses in bats, the coronaviruses in squamous antlers, and the SARS-CoV virus that was later detected in the market. It was later discovered that the first person to have symptoms had the disease on December 1.
Of the group of early cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be market-related.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report published by the South China Morning News indicated that a case dating from November 17, 2019, aged 55 from Hubei Province, may have been the first. On February 26, 2020, the World Health Organization reported that although the first reported cases in China decreased, they suddenly rose in Italy, Iran and South Korea, with the number of new cases surpassing the number of cases outside China.
There may be a significant underreporting of cases, especially among those with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, a relatively small number of cases were reported among young people, with 19-year-olds and under accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. The UK's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Valance, estimated that 60% of Britons needed to be infected before effective herd immunity could be performed.
Cases indicate how many people have been tested for COVID-19 and have been confirmed according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country has conducted the test for more than 3% of its population, and many countries have official policies regarding not having the test only for people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that an estimated 86% of COVID-19 cases had not been detected in China as of January 23, and that these unrecorded infections were the source of infection for 79% of the recorded cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the recorded cases.
Preliminary estimates of the baseline reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 are recovering.
For those who do not recover, the period from worsening symptoms to death takes between 6 and 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, COVID-19 has caused about 97,000 deaths.
About 80% of deaths in China as of February 5 were in people over 60 years of age, and 75% had pre-existing conditions including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official statistics of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to those who have been diagnosed with COVID according to official protocols.
The true number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, because it may not include people who die without being tested – for example; at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data in Italy revealed that the number of excess deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official number of Covid deaths recorded by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that “we know that [the number of deaths reported] reflects an underestimation,” a statement supported by narrative reports of inaccuracies in the U.S. This type of underestimation occurs in pandemics; such as the January 2020 H1N1 pandemic in 2009. The first fatality was in MKH9.
The first death outside mainland China was on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.
By 28 February, more than a dozen deaths had been recorded outside mainland China in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica. Several measures are commonly used to determine mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the size of the tests, the quality of the health care system, treatment options and time spent since the outbreak began, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and public health. The death-to-injury ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases over a given period of time.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-injury ratio is 6.0 percent (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of mortality from infections have decreased from 17.3% (for those who developed symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those who developed symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other metrics refer to CFR, which reflects the percentage of confirmed deaths from the disease, and IFR, which reflects the percentage of confirmed deaths from the disease.
These statistics do not have a time frame and track a specific population from infection to the fate of the condition.
A number of academics have attempted to calculate these numbers for certain population groups.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates that infection mortality for the pandemic as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this range corresponds to the results of the first randomized COVID-19 test in Germany, and to a statistical study that analyses the effect of the test in case mortality estimates.
The World Health Organization (WHO) says the pandemic can be brought under control.
The peak of the outbreak and its maximum duration are uncertain and may vary by location.
Masig Bonny of Pennsylvania State University said: “Infectious disease outbreaks that are left uncontrolled usually peak and begin to decline afterwards when the disease does not find available hosts.
“But it’s almost impossible to come to any reasonable expectation right now about the timing of that.”
Chinese government chief medical adviser Zhong Nanshan said it could be "ended by June" if all countries could be motivated to follow the WHO's advice on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharsky of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "would be widespread for perhaps a year or two".
According to a study conducted by Imperial College London under the supervision of scientist Neil Ferguson, we will need to rely on physical distancing and other measures “until a vaccine becomes available (perhaps 18 months or more).”
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, “I think it’s unlikely that this coronavirus will completely disappear — because it’s easily transmissible,” and it could “become a seasonal disease — so it comes back every year.”
The ferocity of the return will depend on collective immunity and the extent of the transformation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively unspecified and people with COVID-19 may not have symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, sputum discharge (sputum), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, bleeding, diarrhea, or glaucoma. The World Health Organization confirms that approximately one in six people suffers severely from the disease.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States confines itself to emergency symptoms of difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up, and glaucoma. Immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms appear. The worsening of the disease may lead to acute pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, and acute respiratory distress.
Some people who do not have clinical symptoms may show symptoms, but the results of the tests confirm their infection, so specialists have advised that people in contact should be closely monitored for confirmed cases and screened to rule out infection.
Chinese estimates for asymptomatic cases range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the period between injury and onset of symptoms) ranges from 1 to 14 days; often five days. As an example of confusion, the estimated proportion of people with COVID-19 who initially lost their sense of smell was 30% and then recently dropped to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still being researched.
It is believed that the disease spreads mainly during mixing or through spraying when coughing, sneezing, or talking; when mixing at a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that a cough without covering the mouth can result in a spray that spreads from 4.5 metres (15 ft) to 8.2 metres (27 ft).
Some argue that the virus may also be transmitted by a spray stuck in the air for a long time, which may be produced while speaking. It may also produce a respiratory spray during exhalation, including when speaking, although the virus is not generally transmitted by air.
The spray may fall on the mouths or noses of people nearby or inhale into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), may release respiratory secretions in the form of a spray and then spread through the air.
It can also spread when you touch a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touch your eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there are concerns about the possibility of spreading from faeces to the mouth, this risk is thought to be limited.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from stool to mouth. The virus is most contagious during the first three days of onset of symptoms, although it may spread before the onset of any symptoms and during later stages of the disease.
People have been diagnosed with the disease up to three days before symptoms appear, suggesting a possible transmission before severe symptoms appear.
There are few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact tracing surveys.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) confirms that although there is some ambiguity about how easily the disease can spread, one person can infect two to three others overall. The virus remains on surfaces from hours to days.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene), 304 stainless steel, one day on cardboard, and up to four hours on copper.
However, this varies based on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have been confirmed to be infected with COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however, British authorities advise washing hands after contact with animals, as is the case when contacting other surfaces that may have been touched by an infected person.
SARS-CoV-2 is an emerging virus, first isolated from three people who had pneumonia in contact with a group of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 shares all its properties with the coronaviruses found in nature. Outside the human body, household soap kills the virus, as it dissolves its protective membrane. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to have an animal origin.
Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus converges genetically with the genus beta-coronavirus, and falls under the subspecies of the SARB virus (Stamm B) as well as two strains originating from bats.
Matches 96% across the entire genome with other samples of coronaviruses in bats (Bat Cove Rat G13)
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there was only one amino acid difference in certain parts of genome sequences between viruses originating from squamous ant-eaters and viruses originating from humans.
Comparison of the entire genome to date has resulted in the discovery of a maximum of 92% of genetic material sharing between Squamous Ant-eating coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, an insufficient proportion to prove that Squamous ant-eating virus is the intermediate host.
The diagnosis of HIV can be made temporarily based on symptoms, although confirmation is ultimately made by a polymerase-reverse transcription chain reaction (RT-PCR) of infected secretions or CT scans.
A study in Wuhan comparing polymerase chain reaction and CT showed that CT scans are more sensitive than polymerase chain reaction, although less accurate, with many of its imaging characteristics interfering with pneumonia and other pathological stages.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends “not to use computerized tomography to detect COVID-19 or consider it a preliminary examination for the diagnosis of the disease.”
The World Health Organization (WHO) published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2 for the first time on January 17.
The test uses a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in real time.
The test can be performed on samples of the respiratory system or blood.
Results are generally available within a few hours to days.
This test is generally performed by a nasopharyngeal swab, and a swab of the throat can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies develop serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of them have been sufficiently proven to be widely adopted.
A serological test developed by Celex has been approved for emergency use in the United States in approved laboratories only.
The imaging properties of radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people with disease symptoms include asymmetrical peripheral opacity such as sapphire glass mist and blurred crystal infiltration.
The Italian Society of Radiation collects an international online database of imaging results for confirmed cases.
Radiation imaging without a polymerase chain reaction is a low-precision procedure for the detection of COVID-19 because it interferes with other diseases such as adenovirus infection.
A large study in China compared the results of a chest computed tomography and polymerase chain reaction and proved that although imaging is less accurate in terms of proving infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting that it is considered a screening tool in endemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based neural convolutional networks have been developed to detect the characteristics of virus imaging in both radiographs and CT scans.
Strategies to prevent transmission of the disease include maintaining good hygiene in general, washing hands, avoiding contact with eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and using a napkin when coughing or sneezing and then discarding it directly in the trash.
Those already infected were advised to wear a medical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Several governments have banned unnecessary travel to and from countries and regions affected by the outbreak or advised against travel.
However, the virus has reached the stage of spreading throughout society in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some individuals do not know where or how they were infected. Health care providers, who care for a person who is likely to be infected, are advised to take appropriate measures, mixing precautions and eye protection.
The use of mobile location data by governments for tracking has raised concerns about privacy, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement calling for such surveillance to be restricted.
Many mobile apps are designed or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen dedicated groups have been working on privacy-sensitive solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record how close the user is to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they approach a person who has been diagnosed with COVID-19. Misconceptions about how to prevent infection are promoted; for example, washing the nose and gargleing with mouthwash is not a viable solution.
There is still no vaccine for COVID-19, although many organizations have been producing a vaccine.
It is recommended to wash your hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people wash their hands repeatedly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when dirt appears on their hands, before eating, and after emptying their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because household soap kills the virus outside the body; it destroys its protective membrane.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recommended using a hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
The World Health Organization advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected with several disinfectants (within one minute of applying the disinfectant to the surface of stainless steel), including; ethanol 62–71%, isopropanol 50–100%, sodium hypochlorite 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and iodopovidone 0.2–7.5%.
Other antiseptics, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, exist less effectively.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that when a person is suspected or confirmed to have been infected with COVID in a facility such as an office or care centre, all places such as offices, bathrooms, shared spaces, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs used by the patient should be sterilized.
Health organizations recommended that people cover their mouths and noses when coughing or sneezing, either bend the elbow and place it in front of the mouth and nose, or use a tissue paper and get rid of any tissues immediately.
Those who are likely to be infected are recommended to use medical masks, as wearing the mask reduces the size of the respiratory spray and the distance it cuts when it is scattered due to talking, sneezing and coughing.
The World Health Organization has issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “Wearing a mask can reduce [people’s] desire to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection if hands are not properly cleaned.” People who take care of people who are likely to have the disease are recommended to use chins.
The World Health Organization has recommended that healthy people wear masks only if they are at high risk of infection, such as those taking care of a person with COVID-19, although it also acknowledges that wearing masks may help people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have started encouraging ordinary people to wear face masks.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends wearing a non-medical face mask made of cloth. China specifically recommended that healthy people use disposable medical masks, especially in the case of direct contact with people (at a distance of 1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong recommends wearing a medical mask when using public transport or staying in crowded places.
Thai health officials encourage individuals to make fabric masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia banned going to public places without wearing a mask or covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear masks when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government forced anyone entering a grocery store to wear a mask.
Israel asked all residents to wear masks in public.
Taiwan, which has produced 10 million masks a day since mid-March, demanded that passengers on trains and intercity buses wear masks on April 1.
Panama has made it necessary to wear a face mask when going out, while also recommending the manufacture of face masks at home for those who cannot afford to buy face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves infection control measures aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing mixing between individuals.
Roads include quarantine; travel restrictions; and closures of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping malls.
Individuals can apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, exchanging greetings without touching, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments currently impose or recommend social distancing in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of gatherings recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (if no outbreak of COVID-19 has been detected in the region) to 50 people, and 10 people later.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older people and those with chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and weakened immune systems face the term “social substitution” as the “social substitution” of the term “social substitution” has begun, with the “immunity reduction” of diseases and serious complications. The CDC has advised them to stay home as much as possible in outbreak areas between communities.
The use of the term "social distancing" has led to the suggestion that people should engage in complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to communicate with others through alternative means. Some authorities have issued sexual health directives to use during the pandemic.
This includes recommendations to have sex only with someone you live with who is not a carrier of the virus or has symptoms.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for people with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Several governments have imposed or recommended self-quarantine for all populations living in affected areas.
The strongest self-quarantine instructions were issued to those most at risk.
Those who have treated a person with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region where the infection is widely transmitted by self-quarantine have been advised for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
Strategies for controlling outbreaks are containment or containment and limiting the spread.
Containment is applied in the early stages of an outbreak and is aimed at tracking and isolating infected people as well as introducing other infection control measures and vaccines to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When the spread of the disease is not contained, efforts are then directed to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the health care system and society.
A combination of both containment and mitigation measures can be done at the same time.
Curbing requires tougher measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the number of primary reproductions to less than 1. Part of managing outbreaks of infectious diseases attempts to reduce the peak of the epidemic, while flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of health services stress and provides more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmacological interventions that may address outbreaks include personal protective measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing masks and self-quarantine; community actions aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling large gatherings; community solidarity to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as roof cleaning.
Other countries have also taken a variety of measures aimed at curbing the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass examinations and local quarantine, issuing alerts about the movements of the injured.
Singapore provided financial support to the injured who had isolated themselves and imposed heavy fines on those who had not done so.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and criminalized hoarding of medical supplies. Simulations of Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing down rather than stopping the spread of the epidemic) and curbing (reversing the growth of the epidemic) face significant challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies may reduce peak demand for health care by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and strain on health systems.
Braking may be preferable but should be maintained as long as the virus spreads in humans (or until the vaccine becomes available, if this happens first), as the transmission on the other hand bounces back quickly when measures are eased.
Long-term intervention to curb the pandemic causes social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing for existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medications, drinking fluids, and rest can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids may worsen the results.
Many compounds that have previously been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are tested for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization has also reported that some “traditional and home remedies” can provide relief for symptoms caused by SARS-CoVID-19.
Increasing capacity and adapting health care centers to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients has been described by the World Health Organization as key measures to respond to the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and the WHO European Regional Office have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to transfer resources at multiple levels, including focusing laboratory services on the COVID-19 test, eliminating optional procedures where possible, separating and isolating people infected with COVID-19, increasing intensive care capacities through staff training and increasing the number of artificial respiration devices and beds available.
There are multiple theories about where the first case originated (so-called Patient Zero).
The first known case of the novel coronavirus may date back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of cases of the coronavirus in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mostly associated with the Wuhan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sells live animals, and one theory is that the virus came from one of these species; in other words, it has an animal origin. A group infected with pneumonia was observed for an unknown cause on December 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Jaishian at Hubei County Hospital, who informed the Center for Disease Control at Jhen.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of a “SARS-like coronavirus.”
Police alerted eight of these doctors, including Li Wen Liang, to spread false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission subsequently issued a public notice on 31 December and notified the World Health Organization.
Sufficient cases of pneumonia have been reported to health authorities in Wuhan, prompting them to begin investigation in early January. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases was doubling approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces of China, with the help of movements during the Chinese New Year and the fact that Wuhan is a transportation hub and the intersection point of major railway lines.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Subsequent official data show that 6,174 people had already shown symptoms by 20 January 2020. As of 26 March, the United States has surpassed China and Italy with the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of 9 April 2020, there have been reports of more than 1.61 million cases worldwide, with more than 97,000 people dying and more recovering.
About 200 countries and territories have registered at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted freedom of movement and imposed border controls.
National responses included containment measures, such as quarantine (known as stay-at-home orders, take-in orders, or closures) and curfews. As of 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, have undergone a form of closure in the United States, more than 50 million people have undergone closures in the Philippines, and about 59 million people have undergone closures in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people have undergone closures.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide underwent one form of shutdown, a number that rose to 2.6 billion two days later—about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates from December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; one unconfirmed report indicates that the first case was on November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jishian observed a series of cases of pneumonia caused by unknown cause on December 26, and subsequently reported to her hospital to the Centers for Disease Control in Jianghan, Wuhan, on December 27.
A preliminary genetic test of patients’ samples on December 27, 2019 indicated a SARS-like coronavirus.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice on December 31.
The WHO was informed on the same day.
With these notifications in place, doctors in Wuhan have been warned by police about “spreading rumors” about the outbreak.
China's National Health Commission initially claimed there was no "clear evidence" of a person-to-person transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign that Communist Party of China Secretary-General Xi Jinping later described as a “people’s war” to contain the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as "the largest quarantine in human history", a health cordon was announced on 23 January to stop travel to and from Wuhan, extending to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, and affecting about 57 million people.
Private vehicles were banned in the city.
The Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were cancelled in several places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a makeshift hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed within 10 days.
Another hospital was then built, Lichenshan Hospital, to deal with the additional patients.
In addition to the newly established hospitals, China has also turned 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as conference centers and stadiums, into makeshift hospitals. On January 26, the government took other measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including providing health announcements to travelers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools were also closed across the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have taken several measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Remote work measures have been taken in several Chinese regions.
Travel restrictions were imposed inside and outside Hubei.
Public transport has been modified, and museums have been temporarily closed across China.
Public traffic has been tightly controlled in several cities, and it is estimated that about 760 million people (more than half the population) have been subjected to some form of exit restriction. After the outbreak became global in March, Chinese authorities took drastic measures to prevent the virus from being “brought” to them from other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine on all returnees to the city from other countries. On 23 March, one case has moved locally in mainland China over the past five days, via a traveler returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang stated that the spread of locally transmitted infections and control of the outbreak in China has receded.
Travel restrictions in Hubei were eased on the same day, with the exception of Wuhan, two months after the closure was imposed. The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on March 26, 2020, that visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from March 28 onwards, with no specific details on when this policy would end.
Those wishing to enter China will have to apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government urged companies and factories to resume work on March 30, and offered a set of cash incentives to companies. The State Council declared a three-minute day of silence on April 4 at 10:00, coinciding with the Qingming Festival, although the central government has asked families to show respect online for physical distancing to avoid the COVID-19 outbreak again.
The transition of COVID-19 from China to South Korea was confirmed on January 20, 2020.
The National Health Agency announced a significant increase in confirmed cases on 20 February, largely due to a gathering in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Church of Shincheonji Jesus.
Shincheonji's followers visiting Daegu from Wuhan are suspected to be the source of the outbreak.
As of 22 February, 1,261 people, or about 13% of 9,336 church followers, reported symptoms. South Korea announced the highest levels of preparedness on 23 February 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, rising to 3,150 on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after tests confirmed three soldiers had been infected with the virus.
Flight schedules were also affected, and then changed. South Korea implemented a program that was considered the largest and best organized in the world to screen people for the virus, isolate any infected people as well as track their contacts and quarantine them.
Screening methods included mandatory personal reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals via the mobile app, testing for the virus on people in their cars with test results available the next day, and increasing testing capabilities to up to 20,000 people per day.
South Korea's program represents success in controlling the outbreak despite not applying quarantine to entire cities. South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions either calling for Moon’s removal, alleging government mishandling of the outbreak, or praising his response.
On 23 March, it was announced that South Korea had the lowest total cases in a single day in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that as of 1 April all new arrivals from abroad would be subject to quarantine for two weeks.
According to media reports on April 1, South Korea received requests from 121 different countries to help test the virus.
Iran reported its first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 on February 19 in Qom, where two people died later the same day, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education.
Early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural and sports events, Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, higher education institutes and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion rials to fight the virus.
On February 26, 2020, President Hassan Rouhani stated that there was no plan to quarantine the areas affected by the outbreak, and only individuals would be isolated.
Plans to limit intercity travel were announced in March, although heavy intercity traffic continued before the new Persian year of Nowruz.
Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020. During February, Iran became the epicentre of the spread of the virus after China.
Amid allegations of Iranian cover-up over the extent of the outbreak, more than a dozen countries tracked their cases returning from Iran as of February 28, suggesting the extent of the outbreak could exceed the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government to date.
Iran’s parliament was shut down, with 23 of its 290 members reported to have contracted the virus on March 3.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch called on Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, and also to provisionally release eligible prisoners.
There is a high risk of the virus spreading in indoor settings, such as detention centers, which also lack adequate medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian government announced 100 deaths in one day, the highest number recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
At least 12 Iranian politicians and current and former government officials will die from the disease by March 17.
By 23 March, Iran was registering 50 new cases per hour, and one death every ten minutes due to the coronavirus.
According to a WHO official, the number of cases in Iran is probably five times higher than what was announced.
It is also believed that U.S. sanctions on Iran may affect the state’s financial capacity to respond to the virus outbreak.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for an easing of economic sanctions on the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak in Italy was confirmed on January 31, when SARS-CoV-2 tests for Chinese tourists in Rome came in positive.
Cases began to increase sharply, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
An unrelated group of COVID-19 cases was later discovered, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a decree of a new law to contain the outbreak, including quarantine for more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, “There will be no access to or exit from the outbreak areas.
Work activities and sporting events have already been ordered to be suspended in those areas." On 4 March, the Italian government ordered the complete closure of all schools and universities across the country with 100 deaths in Italy.
All major sporting events, including Premier League matches, were scheduled to be held behind closed doors until April, but on March 9, all sporting events were suspended entirely for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the suspension of almost all commercial activities, with the exception of supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations regarding which screening protocols could be used.
On 19 March, Italy outperformed China as the country with the highest number of coronavirus-related deaths in the world after reporting 3,405 deaths due to the pandemic.
On March 22, Russia sent nine military aircraft carrying medical equipment to Italy.
As of April 5, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths, and 21,815 recoveries in Italy, most of which were in the Lombardy region.
A combination of a large number of older people and the inability to test all people infected with the virus so far in Italy may have contributed to the high mortality rate, the CNN report said.
The UK’s response to the virus first emerged as the most lax among affected countries, and as of 18 March 2020, the UK government has not imposed any form of social distancing or comprehensive quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government has received criticism for its perceived lack of speed and severity in responding to concerns faced by the public. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement advising that unnecessary travel or social contact be avoided, suggesting people work from home as much as possible and avoiding several places, such as bars, restaurants, and theaters.
On 20 March, the government announced that it would close all recreational facilities such as bars and gyms as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' wages up to a maximum of <0xC2><0xA3>2,500 per month to reduce unemployment at a time of crisis.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were implemented by the police by issuing fines and dispersing gatherings.
Most companies were ordered to close, with the exception of “essential” businesses, including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, petrol stations and garages.
On January 20, the first known case of COVID-19 in the northwestern Pacific state of Washington was confirmed by a man returning from Wuhan on January 15.
The White House Coronavirus Task Force was set up on January 29.
On January 31, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency and restricted entry for travelers from China.
On January 28, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the U.S. government’s leading public health institute, announced that it had developed its own test kit.
Despite doing so, the U.S. has been slow to start testing, blocking the true extent of the outbreak at the time.
The test corrupted a flawed test kit produced by the federal government in February, the lack of federal government approval for non-governmental test kits (by academia, companies, and hospitals) until the end of February, and the restricted criteria for people to qualify for the test until early March (a doctor’s order was required thereafter).
By February 27, The Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
By March 13, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted.
On March 22, the Associated Press reported: "Many people who had experienced symptoms and had a doctor's order waited hours or days for testing." After reporting the first death in the United States in Washington state on February 29, Governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency, a measure that was soon followed by other states.
Schools in Seattle cancelled school on March 3, and by mid-March, schools across the country had closed. On March 6, 2020, the United States was informed of expectations regarding the impact of the novel coronavirus on the country by epidemiologists at Imperial College London.

Companies imposed travel restrictions on employees, canceled conferences, and urged employees to work from home.
Sports activities and seasons have been cancelled. On 11 March, Trump announced travel restrictions for most of Europe, excluding the UK, for 30 days, as of 13 March.
The following day, the restrictions were extended to include the UK and Ireland.
On 13 March, he declared a national emergency, which allowed federal funds to be used to respond to the crisis.
As of March 15, many companies have closed or reduced their working hours across the United States in an effort to curb the spread of the virus.
By 17 March, the epidemic had been confirmed in all 50 states and in the District of Columbia. On 23 March, 10,700 cases of the New York City coronavirus were reported, more than the total number of cases in South Korea.
On 25 March, the governor said social distancing appeared to have been a success, with estimates showing a doubling of cases from 2.0 days to 4.7 days.
As of 28 March, there were 32,308 confirmed cases in New York City, and 672 people died from the virus. On 26 March, more confirmed cases of coronavirus were reported in the United States than in any other country in the world, including China and Italy. As of 8 April, 400,335 cases were confirmed in the United States, and 12,841 people died.
According to media reports on March 30, US President Trump decided to extend the social divergence directives until April 30.

On April 3, the United States recorded 884 deaths from the coronavirus within 24 hours.
In New York State, the number of cases exceeded 100,000 people on April 3. The White House has been criticized for underestimating the threat and controlling the circulation of news by directing health officials and scientists to coordinate public statements and publications related to the virus with the office of Vice President Mike Pence.
The Trump administration’s handling of the crisis has not been universally acclaimed as it has generated broad polarization among parties.
Some U.S. officials and commentators have criticized U.S. reliance on imports of essential items, including essential medical supplies, from China.
The analysis of air travel patterns was used to map and predict prevalence patterns and was published in the Journal of Travel Medicine in mid-January 2020.
Based on information from IATA 2018, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Taipei had the largest number of passengers from Wuhan.
Dubai, Sydney, and Melbourne have also been reported as popular destinations for travelers from Wuhan.
Bali was reported to be the least capable of more than 20 popular destinations in terms of preparedness, while cities in Australia were considered the most capable. Australia released its emergency response plan for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) on 7 February.
Much has not yet been discovered about the COVID-19 virus, and Australia will emphasize border control and communications in its response to the pandemic.
On 21 March, a human biosecurity emergency was declared in Australia.
As public transport is affected by the effective quarantine in Wuhan and Hubei, several countries have planned to evacuate their citizens and diplomatic staff from the region, primarily through charter flights from their home countries, with Chinese authorities providing permits.
Canada, the United States, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany, and Thailand were among the first countries to plan to evacuate their citizens.
Pakistan has announced that it will not evacuate any of its citizens from China.

On February 15, the United States announced that it would evacuate the Americans who were aboard the cruise ship Diamond Princess.
On 21 February, a plane landed in Trenton, Ontario, carrying 129 Canadian passengers evacuated from the Diamond Princess.
In early March, the Indian government began evacuating its citizens from Iran. On 14 March, an aircraft from South African Airlines chartered by the South African government repatriated 112 South African citizens.
A pre-departure medical examination was carried out, leaving four South Africans who showed signs of the coronavirus to mitigate the risk.
Only South Africans whose test results were negative were returned.
Test results showed that South Africans, including flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers involved in the humanitarian mission who were all, as a precaution, under surveillance and quarantine at Ranch Resort for 14 days, were uninfected.
On March 20, the United States began to partially withdraw its troops from Iraq due to the pandemic.
On February 5, the Chinese Foreign Ministry reported that 21 countries (including Belarus, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Egypt, and Iran) had sent aid to China.

In March, China, Cuba and Russia sent medical supplies and experts to help Italy cope with the coronavirus outbreak.
Businessman Jack Ma sent 1.1 million test kits, 6 million face masks and 60,000 protective suits to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where they were distributed by the African Union.
He later sent 5,000 test kits, 100,000 face masks and five artificial respirators to Panama.
Ma also donated medical supplies to Canada. The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia, and the Czech Republic expressed concern about masks and test kits made in China.
For example, Spain withdrew 58,000 test kits for the China-made coronavirus that were only 30% accurate, and in the meantime, the Netherlands returned 600,000 face masks made in China that were defective.
Belgium returned 100,000 unusable face masks that were thought to be from China, but were actually from Colombia.
On the other hand, parts of Latin America and Africa have welcomed well-received Chinese aid. On April 2, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities in managing and containing the epidemic.
The World Health Organization (WHO) noted the difference between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, where Chinese authorities were accused of the blackout that hampered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, where the central government provided "regular updates to avoid panic before the Lunar New Year holiday."
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to implement the ban on transportation in Wuhan, the representative of the World Health Organization (WHO) Guden Galia noted that while this was "certainly not an international recommendation for the WHO", it was "a very important indicator of countries' commitment to contain the epidemic in the place where it is most concentrated", calling it "unprecedented in the history of public health". On 30 January, after the confirmation of the transition from one person to another in China
The WHO Director-General said that considering the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern is due to the “risk of global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries that do not have strong health systems.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to take measures that are unnecessarily inconsistent with international travel and trade" and that "WHO does not recommend limiting trade and mobility."
On 5 February, the World Health Organization (WHO) appealed to the international community to contribute $675 million to strategic funds in low-income countries, noting the urgent need to support those countries that “do not have systems to detect people infected with the virus, even if it does appear.”
Tedros also made statements in which he declared that "our strength is measured by the strength of the weakest of us" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay a big price later". On 11 February, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease, at a press conference, COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General Ant<0xC3><0xB3>nio Guterres had agreed to provide “the potential of the entire UN system to respond.”
As a result, a UN crisis management team was set up, which allowed the entire UN response to be coordinated, and the WHO would allow it to “focus on the health response while leveraging the expertise of other agencies to see the broader social, economic, and developmental impacts of the outbreak.”
On 14 February, a WHO-led joint mission team with China was prepared to provide international experts and WHO experts on the ground in China to assist with local management and assess the "severeness and transmissibility of the disease" by hosting workshops and meetings with key national institutions, and to conduct field visits to assess the "impact of response activities at the provincial and city level, including urban and rural areas". On 25 February, WHO announced that
In response to the spread of the outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team there to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the global coronavirus threat assessment would rise from “high” to “very high”, its highest level of warning and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO’s health emergency programme, warned in a statement: “This is a real test for every government on earth: so we have to be prepared.
“This virus may be on its way and you have to prepare for it,” he urged taking the right response measures that can help the world avoid “worse things.”
Ryan also stated that current data does not justify public health officials declaring the disease a global pandemic, saying such a declaration means “we fundamentally accept that every human being on the planet will be exposed to this virus.”
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The Director-General said that WHO is “deeply concerned by the alarming levels of prevalence and severity, and the alarming levels of inaction.” The World Health Organization (WHO) has faced strong criticism for what is seen as inadequate treatment of the pandemic, including the delay in declaring a public health emergency, and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The backlash included a petition by WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom to tender his resignation, which was signed by 733,000 people as of April 6.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts affirmed respect for the rights of everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group stated that everyone has the right to life-saving interventions and the government bears this responsibility.
The group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should not be a justification for discrimination against a particular group.
The experts stressed that everyone has the right to health, including persons with disabilities, members of minorities, the elderly, internally displaced persons, the homeless, those living in very poor conditions, detainees, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
Intergovernmental organizations are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has launched a platform to provide comprehensive and timely information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as perspectives and advice.
Among the policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy to address the effects of closures and travel restrictions, the digital hub includes a state policy tracking tool, which aims to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the coronavirus.
The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, British Cabinet Office Secretary Michael Gove, and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s son Edward Bolsonaro for its handling of the pandemic, which began in China’s Hubei province.
Several Chinese Communist Party (CPC) leaders have been dismissed across multiple sectors over their handling of central China’s quarantine efforts, a sign of dissatisfaction with the political establishment’s response to the outbreak in those areas.
Some commentators believe the move was aimed at protecting Communist Party of China (CPC) general secretary Xi Jinping from public discontent over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, for example Zhao Lijian, have previously rejected an acknowledgement that the outbreak of the coronavirus began in Wuhan, in favor of conspiracy theories claimed by the United States or Italy regarding COVID-19.
The US administration of Donald Trump has described the coronavirus as a “Chinese virus” or “Wuhan virus,” saying China has “imposed a news blackout that has exacerbated the virus that is now a global pandemic,” something some critics have criticized for being racist and “distracted from his administration’s failure to contain the disease.”
The Daily Beast received a U.S. government cable reviewing the communications scheme with clear sources at the National Security Council, stating with a strategy that “everything is about China.
We have been asked to seek and disseminate these messages in any way possible, including press conferences and television appearances. “News sources such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that China’s efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda push for global influence.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has warned of a “political geo-component that includes a struggle for influence through the practice of circumvention and policies of generosity.”
Borrell also said “China is strongly pushing the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner.”
China has also called on the United States to lift its sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while reportedly sending aid to the latter two countries.
U.S. sanctions banned Jack Ma from donating 100,000 masks to Cuba on April 3.
U.S. authorities have also been accused of diverting aid to other countries to their home countries.
There have been reported mask-related disputes between other countries, such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has seized hundreds of artificial respirators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the EU’s lack of solidarity with Italy affected by the coronavirus.
Mauritso Masary, Italy’s ambassador to the EU, said: “It is only China that has responded bilaterally.
Certainly, this is not a good sign of European solidarity.”
On 22 March, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian military to send military paramedics, special clearance vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an unnamed “high-level political source” as saying that 80 percent of Russia’s aid was “useless or of little use to Italy”.
The source accused Russia of launching a striking “geographical and diplomatic political” attack.
Lombardy’s president, Attilio Fontana, and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio denied the press reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane carrying medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that “when providing assistance to his American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials are activated again, they will also be able to give back if necessary.”
NATO’s planned “Defensive 2020” military exercises will take place in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, the largest NATO military exercise since the end of the Cold War on a small scale.
“In light of the current public health crisis, the training is endangering not only the lives of troops from the United States and many of the participating European countries but also the populations of the countries in which it will be conducted.” The Iranian government has been severely affected by the virus, with about twenty members of parliament as well as fifteen other former or current political figures.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders on March 14, 2020 asking for help, saying that his country is struggling to fight the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of US sanctions against Iran. The outbreak has sparked calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other rich countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts speculated that this could negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of being re-elected in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea has criticized Japan's "ambiguous and negative quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that anyone coming from South Korea would be quarantined at designated government sites for two weeks.
South Korean society was initially polarized by President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon’s impeachment because they claim that the government mishandled or praised the outbreak’s response. The pandemic has allowed countries to pass emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concerns that this could allow governments to tighten their grip on power.
In Hungary, parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orban to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament as well as elections and punish those who spread false information about the virus and the government’s handling of the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak, which has led to many supply shortages, has been blamed for the increasing global use of equipment to combat outbreaks, panic buying, and disruption of factories and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and stalled suppliers.
Many areas also saw panic buying, which resulted in the shelves being devoid of basic grocery items such as food, toilet paper, and water bottles, causing shortages of supplies.
The tech industry in particular has warned of delays in shipments of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100-fold.
This demand pushed prices up to twenty times the normal price and also caused medical supplies to be delayed for four to six months.
It has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, with the World Health Organization warning that this will put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic has provided a new opportunity for Diego shoppers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity led to a shortage of infant milk in some supermarkets and was later banned by the Australian government. Despite the widespread spread of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the subsequent high demand for food products, the two regions survived severe food shortages.
Measures taken by China and Italy to combat the stockpiling and illicit trafficking of bio-based products have succeeded in averting the severe food shortages expected in Europe as well as North America.
Northern Italy has not seen its large agricultural output drop significantly, but prices may rise according to the expectations of industry representatives.
Food shelves were temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released pork stocks to ensure adequate nutrition for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy that require food producers to keep stocks for such emergencies.
China has felt the damage to the global economy: According to a media report on March 16, China’s economy was hit hard in the first two months of 2020 by government measures to curb the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
Since mainland China is a major economic and industrial hub, it has been noted that the outbreak poses a significant destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agatha DeMaris of the Economist Intelligence Unit expected markets to remain volatile until a clearer picture of the possible outcomes emerged.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could surpass those that occurred as a result of the SARS outbreak between 2002 and 2004.
An expert at Washington University in St. Louis estimated the global supply chain was affected by more than $300 billion which could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has reportedly experienced a “distortion” after a sharp drop in oil prices due to falling demand from China.
Global stock markets fell on Feb. 24 due to a surge in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, several U.S. stock indices, including the Nasdaq-100, the Standard <0x26> Poor's 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, recorded their biggest drop since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points, its biggest single-day drop since the 2007–08 financial crisis.
The three indicators ended the week with a decline of more than 10%.
On February 28, Scoop Ratings GMPH confirmed China’s sovereign credit rating, but maintained negative expectations.
Stocks fell again due to concerns about the coronavirus, and the biggest drop was on March 16.
Many believe that economic stagnation is possible.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the emergency measures taken by central banks and countries in a timely manner.
Central banks are responding faster than they were during the 2008 financial meltdown.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected by travel bans, the closure of public places including tourist attractions, and the warning of governments to travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled their flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while British regional airline, Flybe, collapsed.
The impact on the cruise line industry has been at an unprecedented level.
Many train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Spring Festival travel season known as Chunyun, the main travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
National and regional governments have cancelled a number of events with large crowds, including New Year’s celebrations, with private companies also closing their stores independently and attractions such as Hong Kong’s Disneyland and Shanghai’s Disneyland.
Many Lunar New Year events and attractions have been closed to prevent large gatherings, including Beijing’s Forbidden City and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, and in municipalities and districts in China, the authorities extended the New Year holiday until February 10, and instructed most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80% of the country’s GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling New Year’s celebrations. The global retail sector has been affected by reduced store hours or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a decline of between 50 and 60 percent.
This also led to a 33-43 percent decrease in pedestrian traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
Shopping mall operators around the world have imposed additional measures, such as increasing hygiene, installing thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and cancelling events. According to estimates by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLAC), the recession caused by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million people in extreme poverty in Latin America more than would otherwise be without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China's nearly 300 million rural migrant workers have been trapped in their homes in Inner Provinces, or in Hubei Province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The coronavirus outbreak could cost the loss of 47 million jobs in the United States, and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The shutdown in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (paid through daily wages) unemployed in the middle of Spain. A survey conducted by the Angus Reed Institute found that nearly 44% of Canadian households have suffered some form of unemployment since 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a comprehensive credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany sent their workers in government-backed short-term work plans known as cursarbet.
France and Britain have adopted a German short-term work compensation scheme.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of organizations as well as individuals—workers and independents—globally.
The arts and culture sector has sought to support its (often government-funded) mission of providing access to the cultural heritage of the community, maintaining the safety of its employees and the public, and supporting artists as much as possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, exhibition venues, and other cultural institutions around the world had been closed indefinitely, with their exhibitions, events, and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, there have been intensive efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Other recent and accelerating consequences of the disease include the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals, concerts, technology conferences, and fashion shows.
The film industry also suffered a hiatus. The Vatican announced the cancellation of Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which take place during the final week of the Christian Lent season of repentance.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay at home instead of attending mass on Sundays; some churches have made church services available via radio, live internet or television while others offer worship without leaving their cars.
As the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome closed its churches and canonical chapel, and St. Peter's Square was emptied of Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also abolished limited public services and gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, and the Gordwara.
Iran’s health ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and later closed the shrines, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its residents to holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the biggest imbalance in the global sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019–20 Champions League, the 2019–20 Premier League, the 2020 UEFA Europa League, the 2019–20 NBA season, and the 2019–20 NBA season.
The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were due to start at the end of July, and the IOC announced on March 24 that the event would be "rescheduled beyond 2020 but no later than summer 2021". Gambling clubs and other play venues around the world have closed and live gambling tournaments have been postponed or cancelled.
This has led many gamblers to switch to online gaming, with many online gambling sites reporting significant increases in new subscription rates. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups suspending or cancelling concert tours.
Many large theaters such as those on Broadway have suspended all the shows as well.
Some artists have discovered ways to continue producing and sharing work online as an alternative to traditional live performance, such as live streaming concerts or creating online “celebrations” for artists to perform, distribute, and publish their work.
Many Internet memes have spread on the Internet about the coronavirus as much has turned to humor and entertainment under uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, strong prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and against people from hotspots have been observed in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports released in February (when the majority of cases were still confined to China) documented racist sentiments expressed by various groups around the world toward the Chinese that they deserved the virus or were receiving what was allegedly justified punishment.
Anti-China sentiment has also seen a rise in some African countries.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination because of their territorial origin.
There has been support for the Chinese both online and offline, and for those living in areas affected by the virus.
Following the outbreak in new hotspots, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe outbreak of COVID-19, may be sceptical and xenophobic. Citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed petitions to pressure the Chinese to enter their country in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag ChineseDontComeToJapan releases <0x23>Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States reported increasing levels of racial abuse, as well as assaults.
U.S. President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as a “Chinese virus,” a term critics have called racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine have attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners who are being evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzari.
Students from northeastern India, which shares a border with China, studying in major Indian cities have been harassed by the coronavirus outbreak.
The head of the Bharatiya Janata Party unit in West Bengal state, Dilip Ghosh, said the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that's why God took revenge on them."
The Chinese consulate in Kolkata later condemned the remarks as “wrong.” In China, the pandemic has led to an increase in xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents, with foreigners labelled as “foreign garbage” and targeted for “disposal.”
Many newspapers have removed paid subscription pages for some or all of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made scientific papers on outbreaks available for open access.
Some scientists have chosen to quickly share their results on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.
Emerging infectious diseases—infectious diseases are often emerging pathogens, emerging in terms of their scale of outbreaks or mode of transmission.

Laboratory testing for COVID-19 and associated SARS-CoV-2 includes ways to detect the presence of the virus as it recognizes antibodies that produce a response to infection.
RT-PCR confirms the presence of viruses in the samples, where it detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is accurate and designed only to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active cases of infection.
Antibody detection (serumology) is used to diagnose and monitor populations.
Antibody tests show how many people have contracted the disease, including those whose symptoms were too mild to report or who did not show symptoms.
The exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity in the population can be determined based on the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, no country in March 2020 had reliable data on the spread of the virus among its population.
On 23 March, no country examined more than 3% of its population, and there was a significant discrepancy in the number of tests conducted by different countries.
This discrepancy is also likely to significantly affect reported case mortality rates, which are likely to be overestimated in some countries.
Using the instantaneous reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can be tested on respiratory samples obtained in various ways, including nasopharyngeal swab or sputum sample.
Results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR, which is performed with throat swabs, is only used in the first week of the disease.
The virus may then disappear from the throat as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For infected people who are screened in the second week, a sample of the deep airways can be taken by suction catheterization or coughing (sputum).
An early BCR test at the Charité in Berlin was invented in January 2020 using the RRT-PCR instantaneous polymerase chain reaction, and formed the basis for 250,000 test kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test on January 23, 2020.The South Korean company Kogenebiotech also created a SARS-CoV-2 PowerChek Coronavirus detection kit suitable for safe clinical use and based on PCR on January 28, 2020.
In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from the China National Medical Products Administration for a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributes a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2.
One of the three genetic tests in older versions of test kits yielded inconclusive results due to defective reagents, and one test phase was delayed from the other in CDC, Atlanta; this led to the successful completion of an average of less than 100 samples per day throughout the entire month of February 2020.
Tests using two components were not trusted until February 28, 2020, and until then, government and local laboratories were not allowed to start testing.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the test under the Emergency Use Authorization. Commercial laboratories in the United States began conducting the tests in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, Lab Corp. announced the availability of COVID-19 testing across the country based on RT-PCR.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics has made it possible to test COVID-19 across the country as of March 9, 2020.
No quantitative restrictions have been announced; sampling must be performed and processed in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the State Center for Virology and Biotechnology Research created and produced the COVID-19 test.
On February 11, 2020, the Federal Service for Health Care Surveillance (FSCA) registered the test. On March 12, 2020, it was reported that the Mayo Clinic developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics obtained FDA approval for a test that could be done in 3.5 hours on large numbers, allowing one machine to perform approximately 2,428 hours of testing over a period of 4,128 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorization (E.U.A.) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on the m2000 Abbott system; the FDA had previously granted a permit similar to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Safed received a similar emergency use permit from the Food and Drug Administration in favor of a test that took about 45 minutes.
The Food and Drug Administration has approved a test that uses isothermal DNA amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since this does not require a series of successive temperature cycles, this method can show positive results in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott expects to ramp up manufacturing for 50,000 tests per day. Taiwan is also developing a test that uses a monoclonal antibody that is specifically bound to the novel coronavirus nuclear capsid protein, in the hope that it will be able to achieve results within 15 to 20 minutes such as a rapid flu test.
A review of studies in March 2020 concluded that "breast X-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT results may be apparent even before the onset of symptoms."
Typical characteristics that appear in computerized tomography include double-lobed, double-sided glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetrical, and rear-sided distribution.
The spread under the pleura develops and erratic patches appear and intensify as the disease develops.
A study in the city of Wuhan comparing PCR and CT scans in relation to the origin of the current pandemic suggested that CT scans are more sensitive than PCR, though less accurate, with many of its imaging properties interfering with cases of pneumonia and other pathological stages.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "not using computerized tomography to detect COVID-19 or consider it a preliminary examination to diagnose the disease".
Part of the immune response to infection involves the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
They can be used to detect individuals within a period of 7 days or after the onset of symptoms, to determine immune capacity, and in the case of population surveillance. Tests can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or by clinical point of care (BOCT) testing.
High-performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For central laboratories, a single sample of peripheral blood cells is usually used, although consecutive samples can be used to monitor the immune response.
For a clinical point of care test, a single blood sample is usually drawn by piercing the skin.
Contrary to BCR methods, a pre-screening extraction step is not required. On 26 March 2020, the Food and Drug Administration identified 29 entities that have submitted a notification to the agency in accordance with the requirements and are able to distribute their antibody tests.
On 7 April 2020, the Food and Drug Administration approved only one test under the Emergency Use Authorization. In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European credits for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples.
The test completes several hundred samples in a matter of hours and is therefore much faster than the traditional PCR analysis of viral RNA.
Antibodies can often be detected 14 days after the onset of infection. In April, the UK discovered that the antibody test kits it purchased were not good enough to be used.
Hong Kong has developed a plan under which patients suspected of infection can stay at home, “emergency department gives patients a sample tube”, spit in the tube, and return it to the suspects to get the test result after a short period of time. The British National Health Service (NHS) has announced that it is testing a plan to test suspected cases at home, thus ruling out the risk of infection from the infected when they come to the hospital.
In-vehicle testing centers have enabled South Korea to conduct some of the world’s fastest and most comprehensive tests. In Germany, the National Association of Legal Health Insurance Physicians (NLHI) said on March 2 that it was able to perform about 12,000 outpatient tests per day and 10,700 people were tested last week.
Health insurance is charged if a doctor orders the test.
According to the head of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of about 160,000 tests per week.
On 19 March, in-vehicle testing was available in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests conducted in Germany was unknown, as only positive case results were reported.
A preliminary laboratory study revealed that, starting with the calendar week of February 12/2020, at least 483,295 samples were tested at the same time (in the case of a randomized, randomized, randomized, randomized, randomized, randomized, randomized, randomized, randomized, randomized, randomized, randomized, randomized, randomized, randomized, randomized, randomized, randomized, randomized, randomized, randomized, randomized, randomized, randomized, randomized, randomized controlled trial, and randomized trial.
With Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, overseeing the construction work and taking 5 days to do so, modelling operations showed that cases at Hubei would have increased by 47% and the associated quarantine costs would have doubled if that testing capability had not been completed.
Wuhan Lab immediately followed the establishment of Huo-Yan Laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai and in a total of 12 cities across China.
By March 4, 2020, total daily productivity was 50,000 tests per day. Origami Assays has released open source and multi-transmission designs that can test up to 1,122 patient samples for COVID-19 detection using only 93 tests. These balanced designs can be used in small labs without the need for automated fluid processors.
In March, the shortage and inadequacy of reagents caused a stalemate when a large number of tests were conducted in the EU, UK and US.
This has led some specialists to explore sample preparation protocols that include heating the samples at 98<0xC2><0xB0>C (208<0xC2><0xB0>F) for 5 minutes to edit the RNA genome for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the UAE was ranked top in the world in terms of the ratio of coronavirus testing to its population, and is on track to raise the level of testing to reach most of the population.
This was through a combination of activating in-vehicle testing capability, and purchasing a scale-appropriate ultra-productive laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (depending on their Huo-Yan emergency detection labs in China).
The lab was set up within 14 days, allowing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests to be performed daily, and is the world’s first laboratory of this size to operate outside of China.
Different methods of testing targeting different parts of the genetic traits of the coronavirus have been invented in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has adopted the German plan to manufacture crews sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to create their own crews.
The German plan was announced on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until January 28, delaying tests available in the U.S. China and the U.S. had problems with the reliability of test kits early in the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide sufficient kits to meet the demand and follow the test recommendations made by health experts.
In contrast, experts said the abundance of tests in South Korea helped curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The South Korean government has greatly enhanced testing capacity in private sector laboratories over several years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) called for intensifying testing programs as an optimal solution to limit the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic.The increased demand for testing as a result of the widespread spread of the virus has caused hundreds of thousands of tests to accumulate in U.S. private laboratories, and has also reduced the supply of swabs and chemical reagents.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, “defects” were found in CDC’s test kits; the government then removed bureaucratic barriers that specifically prevented testing. Spain purchased test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Limited, but found the results to be inaccurate.
The company explained that the incorrect results may be due to the failure to collect samples or not to use the crews correctly.
The Spanish ministry said it would backtrack on the purchase of the crews that gave incorrect results, and replace them with other test crews from Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test crews that the Czech Republic bought from China gave the wrong results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million test kits from China that turned out to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovi<0xC4><0x87> proposed to be dumped in the Danube. Professor Ach Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health reported that test kits bought by Turkey from China have a "high error rate" and have "banned their use". The UK also bought 3.5 million test kits from China but in early April 2020 declared them unusable.
The tests, which were followed by a quarantine of those who were confirmed infected and followed those who had contact with SARS-CoV-2, yielded positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Fu, which witnessed the first death of COVID-19 in Italy, tested the entire population of about 3,400 twice, taking about 10 days at a time.
Almost half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all detected cases were isolated.
As a result of the ban on commuting between towns, new infections were completely eliminated.
The 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has seen a significant reduction in the prevalence rate compared to other developed countries, but without strict restrictions such as forced closures of restaurants and retail facilities, through strict tracking of contacts and restrictions on domestic travel, testing and quarantine.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore had already begun urging residents to stay at home on March 28, but schools reopened on March 23 on time after the holiday.
Several other countries have also taken control of the pandemic by scrupulously tracking contacts and imposing restrictions on domestic travel, testing and quarantine, but with less stringent closures, such as in Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study has found that countries with more tests, compared to deaths, have significantly lower mortality rates, perhaps because these countries are better able to detect those who have only mild symptoms or do not have any symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity or have local laboratories with limited COVID-19 expertise send the first five positive samples and the first ten negative samples of COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO-approved laboratories to confirm the test.
Of the 16 accredited laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following graph, the column “% test positive” is influenced by the state’s test policy.
The country that tests only for people who are hospitalized will have positive cases that are 1% higher than the country that tests for all its residents, whether they appear to be symptomatic or not, given that other factors are equal.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand hygiene, is the process of cleaning hands with the purpose of removing dirt, grease, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap constantly at certain "necessary times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the oral anal route.
People can also develop respiratory illnesses such as the flu or a cold, for example, if they don’t wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five essential moments during the day when washing hands with soap are important include: before and after defecation, after cleaning the baby’s ass or changing diapers, before feeding the baby, before eating, before preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If soap and water are not available, the hands can be cleaned with ash. WHO recommends hand washing:
Before, during, and after cooking.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing diapers for a child or cleaning them after using the toilet.
After cleaning your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching the animals, or their feed, or litter.
Medical hygiene of the hands refers to hygiene practices associated with medical procedures.
Washing hands before giving medication or providing medical care can prevent or limit the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important procedure for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases, preventing infectious diseases that cause diarrhea, and reducing respiratory infections.
Reduced infant mortality rates at home.
A 2013 study showed that improved hand washing practices may lead to minor improvements in height growth in children under five.
In developing countries, child mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple procedure can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Measures that encourage hand washing from episodes of diarrhea can reduce by nearly a third, similar to providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% of diarrhoeal episodes can be associated with handwashing with soap. Handwashing with soap is the single most effective and least expensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARIs) when applying spontaneous behavior in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the major acute respiratory infections, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, with an estimated 1.8 million children dying each year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together cause about 3.5 million children to die each year.
According to UNICEF, turning handwashing with soap before eating and after using the toilet into an ingrained habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing deaths from diarrhea by almost half, and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other hygiene measures as part of water, sanitation and hygiene programs (water, sanitation and hygiene).
Washing hands also protects against herpes transmitted through direct physical contact.
A simple detrimental effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can lead to skin damage due to dryness.
A Danish study in 2012 revealed that excessive hand washing can lead to a skin condition of exfoliation and itching known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among healthcare workers.
Too much hand washing is also often seen as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five essential moments during the day when handwashing with soap is important to reduce the transmission of diseases through the oral anal route: after using the bath (urination, defecation), after cleaning the baby's ass (changing diapers), before feeding the baby, before eating, and before/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
The correct hand washing method should be practiced in other cases in order to prevent the transmission of the disease, including before or after the treatment of cutting or wound, after sneezing, coughing or cleaning your nose, after touching or handling animal waste, and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the rate of hand washing with soap decreases.
A study on handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 found that on average 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. A study in 2014 showed that Saudi Arabia has the highest rate of handwashing, estimated at 97 percent, and the U.S. approaches middle school by 77 percent, and in China by 23 percent, the lowest available times.
The “Basic Health Care Program” implemented by the Ministry of Education of the Philippines is an example of widespread action to promote children’s health and education.
Worm treatment twice a year, in addition to daily handwashing with soap, and daily brushing with fluoride, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Adding soap or detergent to water promotes the removal of microorganisms from the skin.
The main effect of soap and detergent is to reduce the obstacles to dissolution, and increase the solubility.
Water alone is an ineffective cleanser for the skin because fats and proteins, which are organic soil components, do not easily decompose in water.
However, the flow of an appropriate amount of water helps to cleanse.
Due to its reusable nature, solid soap may carry bacteria acquired from previous uses.
A few studies that have observed the bacterial transition from contaminated solid soap have concluded that the transition is unlikely because the bacteria are washed away with foam.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to state that it is “preferred to use liquid soap from devices that operate without touching to pump soap.”
Antibacterial soaps are highly popular for health-conscious consumers.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended disinfectants or sterilizers is selected to eliminate antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which does not affect a large number of strains of organisms.
So, if antibacterial soap does not affect antibiotic-resistant strains, it may not be as effective as it is marketed.
Besides the surface tension reducer and skin protection agent, advanced formulations may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as a consumable acid regulator, antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other skin moisturizers (aloe, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).
Hot water suitable for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 <0xC2><0xB0> C).
However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water in removing natural oils that retain soil and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing microbial load on the hands.
A disinfectant or hand sanitizer is a substance that is not water-based for cleaning hands.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-water-based alcohol hand sanitizers that are sterilized through rubbing (also known as hand wash with alcohol composition, hand sanitizer or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol compounded with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in a gel, a moisturizer such as glycerin in a liquid, or foaming for ease of use and reducing the effect of alcohol-induced dehydration.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sterilizers containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol are effective bactericidal.
Alcohol sterilizers by rubbing eliminate bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (golden Staphylococcus is resistant to methicillin and vancomycin-resistant intestinal reagents), tuberculosis, some viruses (including HIV, herpes, respiratory syncytial virus, nasal viruses, pruritus, and influenza.
Alcohol sterilizers that contain 70% alcohol via rubbing eliminate 99.97% (logarithmic decrease of 3.5, similar to a decibel decrease of 35) of bacteria on the hands after 30 seconds of application and 99.99% to 99.999% (logarithmic decrease of 4 to 5) of bacteria on the hands after 1 minute of application.
Alcoholic hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective against Norovirus (or Norowalk) viruses, which is the most common cause of infection-induced gastroenteritis. You should use enough hand sanitizer or rub alcohol to wet or cover both hands completely.
The front and back of the hands and between all fingers and limbs are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel dries.
Fingertips should also be thoroughly washed and rubbed in both palms. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing with a hand sanitizer, especially when the hands are clearly dirty.
The increased use of these detergents is due to their ease of use and their rapid activity in eliminating microorganisms; however, they should not be a substitute for proper hand washing unless soap and water are available.
Frequent use of alcohol hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless you add softeners, skin moisturizers, or both to the composition.
The effect of alcohol on dry skin can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin, other softeners, or both to the formula.
Clinical trials have shown that alcohol hand sanitizers containing softeners cause less skin irritation and dryness than soap or antimicrobial detergents.
Atopic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, hypersensitivity to alcohol or to additives found in alcohol handwashing materials rarely occurs.
Reduced susceptibility to irritant contact dermatitis has become a pull factor compared to hand washing with soap and water.
Despite the effectiveness of detergents that are not water-based, they do not cleanse hands of organic matter, but simply sterilize them.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as the pathogens remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of an alcohol-free hand sanitizer is highly dependent on the ingredients and composition, and historically its effect has been significantly less than that of alcohol-containing and alcohol-based rubbing.
Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have a cumulative and persistent antimicrobial effect after use, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to decrease its effectiveness after repeated use, possibly due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Many people in low-income communities can’t afford to buy soap and use ash or dirt instead.
Ash or dirt may be more effective than water alone, but may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if dirt or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the spread of the disease rather than reduce it.
Ash, like soap, is also an antiseptic because it forms an alkaline solution when it comes into contact with water.
The World Health Organization has recommended using ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
The correct hand washing method recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent transmission of the disease includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
It is recommended to use running water because existing basins may be contaminated, and at the same time the water temperature does not seem to make a difference.
Make foam on the hands by rubbing them with an ample amount of soap, including the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands well when using soap instead of just water.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
Scrub creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and scrubs for longer periods remove more germs.
Rinse well under running water.
Rinsing the hands inside the pelvis may recontaminate them.
Dry with a clean towel or let it dry in the air.
Wet and wet hands are easily contaminated again. The most common parts that are overlooked are the thumb, the wrist, the areas between the fingers, and under the nails.
Synthetic nails and cracked nail polish may contain microorganisms.
A moisturizing lotion is often recommended to prevent dry hands, and dry skin can damage it, which may increase the risk of infection.
Various low-cost options can be provided to facilitate hand washing in developing countries, where tap water or soap or both are not available, such as pouring water from a suspended pot or percussion with suitable holes and/or using ash if necessary. In places with limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are other solutions to rationalize water consumption, such as tap and tap options.
Tippy tap is a simple technique that uses a teapot attached to a rope, a foot-operated control arm to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a piece of soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of hand hygiene, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
A growing number of research suggests that paper towels are healthier than electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study, sponsored by the European Textile Symposium for the manufacture of paper towels, to compare the levels of hygiene provided by paper towels, hand dryers with warm air, and hand dryers with newer jet air.
After washing and drying hands with a warm air dryer, the total number of bacteria increased on average on the fingertips by 194% and on the palm by 254%.
Drying with a jet air dryer increased the average total number of bacteria on the soles of the fingers by 42% and on the palm by 15%.
After washing hands and drying them with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on the soles of the fingers and on the palms was reduced by up to 76% on average by 77%, and the scientists conducted tests to determine whether there was a possibility of infection to other users of the toilet and the toilet environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The jet air dryer, which pushes air out of the unit at speeds of up to 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of inflating microorganisms from the hands and device, and may transmit infection to other toilet users and the toilet environment up to 2 meters away.
The use of a warm air dryer spreads microorganisms within 0.25 meters of the dryer.
Paper towels did not show any significant proliferation of microorganisms. In 2005, a study by TÜV Product und Umwelt evaluated different hand drying methods.
The following changes in the numbers of bacteria have been observed after hand drying:
There are many different hand dryers manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towels.
Washing hands with hand sanitizer wipes is an alternative while traveling due to the lack of soap and water.
The alcohol hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing became mandatory for a long time after the Hungarian physician Agnats Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in the prevention of diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide notes to remind hospital staff to wash their hands as soon as they are forgotten.
One study found lower rates of infection using them.
Medical hand washing is done for at least 15 seconds, using abundant amounts of soap, water or gel to make foam and rub each part of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed together and the fingers intertwined.
If there is litter under the fingernails, a brush with rough hair can be used to remove them.
Since germs may remain in the water on the hands, it is important to rinse them thoroughly and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, a paper towel should be used to close the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This avoids contaminating the hands again from those surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in a healthcare setting is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("bacteria") and avoid their transfer.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that non-hand washing remains at unacceptable levels in most medical settings, with large numbers of doctors forgetting to routinely wash their hands before touching patients, which transmits microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-associated bloodstream infections by 66 percent, and the World Health Organization (WHO) has published a paper outlining how to wash and rub hands in health care sectors.
The organization’s hand hygiene guidance document project can also be found on its website available for public comment.
Whitby and others conducted a related review.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene, if necessary to prove compliance with regulations.
The World Health Organization has “five moments” for hand washing:
After exposure to blood/body fluids
Before the sterilization mission, and
After caring for patients. The addition of disinfectant chemicals to soap ("medical" or "antimicrobial") confers a pesticide element on the handwashing agent.
This element of extermination may be desirable before surgery or in places where antibiotic-resistant organisms are highly prevalent. When rubbing someone’s hands for surgery, a faucet is required that can be turned on and off without touching them with your hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine lotion, other sterile towels for drying hands after washing, and a sterile brush for your hands.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually 2 to 6 minutes.
The length of the rub (10 minutes) is not necessary.
When rinsing, water from the forearms to the hands should be prevented.
After you have washed your hands, dry your hands with a sterile cloth and wear a surgical gown.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use a hand sanitizer before and after taking care of a sick person.
To control the infection of staph in hospitals, the greatest benefit of manual cleansing was found to come from the first 20% of washing, and it gained very little additional benefit when the frequency of hand cleaning increased to more than 35%.
Washing with regular soap results in more than three times the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. By comparing rubbing hands with an alcohol solution with washing hands with antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds, rubbing alcohol reduced bacterial contamination by 26% more than with antibacterial soap.
But soapy water is more effective than alcohol handwashing to reduce H1N1 influenza A virus and hard-to-hand clotting spores. Measures to improve hand hygiene in healthcare settings may include educating employees about handwashing, increasing the availability of alcohol handwashing, and written and verbal reminders to employees.
More research is needed to find out which of these measures is most effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, it is recognized that hand washing with soap is an essential and affordable tool for good health, as well as good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap, or hand-washing facilities in homes, schools, and workplaces makes it difficult to come up with general hand-washing behaviors.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa you rarely find handwashing taps near every private or public toilet, although there are cheap options for building handwashing stations.
However, low rates of hand washing can be caused by ingrained habits rather than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting and advocating handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and lead to long-term behavior change.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are essential.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective in increasing hand washing in lower-middle-income countries, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of promoting hand washing in schools is the “three-star approach” designed by UNICEF to encourage schools to take simple, inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other health requirements.
When minimum standards are met, schools can move from one star up to three stars eventually.
The construction of handwashing stations can be part of handwashing promotions that are conducted to reduce disease and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness-raising campaigns trying to bring about behaviour change. Due to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged the adoption of an emoji for handwashing.
Few studies have looked at the overall cost-effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries and its relationship to disability-adjusted life years.
However, one review suggests that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation procedures.
The importance of hand washing for human health – especially for people going through critical conditions such as newly born mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals – was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Agnats Semmelweis who worked in Vienna in Austria, and the Englishman Florence Nightingale.
Most people at the time still believed that the infection was due to bad smells called myasma.
In the 1980s, foodborne outbreaks and healthcare-related infections prompted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand hygiene more effectively as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have raised awareness in many countries of the importance of hand washing with soap to protect oneself from these infectious diseases.
For example, posters with “right handwashing methods” were hung next to handwashing basins in public toilets and in toilets in Germany’s office buildings and airports.
The phrase “washing hands from” means an announcement of one’s unwillingness to take responsibility for the thing or participate in collusion with it.
A passage from the Bible in Matthew where Pontius Pilate washed his hands stemmed from the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a phrase of much wider use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Mrs. Macbeth begins to wash her hands excessively in an attempt to clear a fictional spot that represents her guilt for the crimes she committed and the crimes she urged her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people, after referring to or thinking about immoral acts, tend to wash their hands more often than others, and tend to appreciate handwashing tools more often.
Moreover, those who are allowed to wash their hands after this study are less likely to participate in other “cleansing” compensatory measures, such as volunteering.
Religions describe hand washing for both health and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, using water without handwashing soap, is part of the handwashing rituals that have emerged in many religions, including the Bah<0xC3><0xA1>'<0xC3><0xAD> Faith, Hinduism, Tefilah, handwashing in Judaism, washing in Christianity and ablution in Islam.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam impose hand washing after using the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands before and after each meal.
Covid-19 Risk Controls in the Workplace
Covid-19 workplace risk controls are the application of occupational safety and health methodologies for risk controls for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Correct workplace risk controls depend on the workplace and job function, based on an assessment of the risk of sources of exposure, the risk of disease in the community, and risk factors for working individuals who may be at risk of COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk work involves minimal contact with the general public and other co-workers, a condition in which it is recommended to apply basic infection prevention procedures, including hand washing and encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, observe cough and sneeze etiquette, and maintain routine cleaning practices.
Functions with moderate exposure risk include those requiring frequent or close contact with individuals who are unknown or suspected to have COVID-19, but who may become infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers who have reached out to the general public as in schools, high labor-intensive work environments, and some large retail locations.
Risk controls for this group, as well as basic infection prevention procedures, include ventilation with high-efficiency air filters, sneezing prevention barriers, and the use of personal protective equipment available in case of dealing with a person with COVID-19.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) considers health-care workers and the cadaver wallet of the deceased who are known to have been infected with COVID-19 or a suspect to be at high risk of exposure, which increases the very high risk of exposure if workers are carrying out aerosol generation procedures, or collecting or handling samples from a known or suspected person infected with COVID-19.
Appropriate risk control controls for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and personal protective equipment appropriate to the job function.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have multiple effects in the workplace.
Employees may be absent from work due to illness, the need to care for others, or fear of potential exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of the quality of the goods ordered, and the ways to obtain them (e.g. shopping off-peak hours or through delivery services or shopping without leaving the car).
Finally, shipments of goods from geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19 may stop. The Preparedness and Response Plan for Infectious Diseases can be used to guide preventive action.
The plans address the levels of risk associated with different workplaces and job functions, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from home and community settings, and risk factors for individual workers such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
It also identifies controls to address those risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of an outbreak.
Preparedness and response plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national and subnational recommendations.
The goals of the outbreak response include reducing transmission among employees, protecting people at high risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business processes, and minimizing negative impacts on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the society in which the business is located affects the responses taken.
The hierarchy of risk control controls is a framework widely used in the field of occupational safety and health to classify risk control controls by effectiveness.
Because the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related risks without relying on worker behavior, and can be the most cost-effective solution for implementation.
Administrative controls are changes in labor policy or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is less effective than engineering and management controls, but it can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of personal protective equipment should be selected based on the risk to the worker, proper suitability as appropriate (e.g. respirators), continuous and correct wear, regular inspection, maintenance and replacement, as necessary, and proper removal, cleaning and storage, or disposal to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs that involve less risk exposure involve minimal communication with the general public and other co-workers.
Basic procedures for the prevention of infection recommended for all workplaces include frequent and complete handwashing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, taking into account cough and sneeze etiquette including covering the mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, providing other cleaning kits and garbage containers, preparing to work remotely or organizing shifts of work in succession if necessary, and volunteering.
Immediate identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is a crucial step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory disease stay at home until fever, fever signs and any other symptoms have cleared for at least 24 hours without using antipyretics or other medications that improve symptoms, and that sick leave policies be flexible, allowing employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and that employees be aware of these policies.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, jobs at medium exposure risk include those requiring frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) of individuals who are unknown or suspected to have COVID-19, but who may develop SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing transmission in the surrounding workplace community, or because a person has recently made international travel to a location where COVID-19 transmission is common.
This includes workers who communicate with the general public as in schools, work environments with high labor intensity, work situations with low labor intensity, work situations with low labor intensity, work situations with low labor intensity, work situations with low labor intensity, work situations with low labor intensity, work situations with low labor intensity, work situations with high risk, work situations with high labor intensity, work situations with high air quality filters, increased ventilation rates, installation of physical barriers such as clear plastic sneezes, and installation of windows to serve customers who do not leave.
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use respirators.
If a person becomes ill while on a plane, appropriate protective controls to protect other workers and passengers include keeping the sick passenger 6 feet away from others, assigning one member of the aircraft team to serve the sick person, providing the sick person with a face mask or requiring the sick person to cover his or her mouth and nose with tissue paper when coughing or sneezing.
Crew members should wear disposable medical gloves when handling a sick passenger or touching contaminated body fluids or surfaces, and may use additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a biohazard prevention bag and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and sterilized thereafter. For commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk controls include delaying travel when sick, self-isolating and immediately informing the medical center on board if a person develops a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should be done in the isolated person’s compartment. For schools and childcare facilities, CDC recommends a short-term closure for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person is present in the school building regardless of the spread in the community.
When there is a limited-to-medium limit to community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented such as canceling field trips, gatherings, and other large gatherings such as physical education classes, band lessons or eating meals at the canteen, increasing distances between offices, organizing successive attendance and departure times, reducing unnecessary visitors, and using a separate health office for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is a significant transmission of infection in the community, in addition to social distancing strategies, school drop-out dates can be considered. For law enforcement personnel who carry out daily routine activities, direct health risks are considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officials who must communicate with individuals who have been confirmed or suspected of contracting COVID-19 are advised to follow the same guidelines as medical emergency technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
In the event of direct contact during arrest, workers should clean and disinfect work belts and tools before reuse with a spray or household cleaning wipe, follow standard work procedures to deal with pollution, dispose of used personal protective equipment, and collect and wash clothes.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) considers that some health care workers and mortuary workers fall into categories with high or very high levels of risk exposure.
Jobs with a high level of exposure include health care, support, laboratory, and medical transport workers who are exposed to known or suspected patients with COVID-19.
These become very high-risk if workers perform aerosol generation procedures, as well as collecting or handling samples from confirmed or suspected patients infected with COVID-19.
Procedures for aerosol generation include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopies, some dental procedures and tests, or invasive sample collection.
High-risk cadaver portfolio functions include workers who are involved in the preparation of the bodies of confirmed or suspected persons infected with COVID-19 at the time of their death; these become at an extremely high risk level if they perform an autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these at-risk groups include isolation rooms for known or suspected patients infected with COVID-19, including when carrying out aerosol generation procedures.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care settings and the preservation of dead bodies.
Samples should be treated using biosafety level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends isolating incoming patients in separate waiting areas based on whether they are suspected of contracting COVID-19 or not. In addition to other personal protective equipment, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends the use of respirators for those who work within 6 feet of known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 patients, and those who perform aerial birth procedures.
In the United States, face mask respirators with an N95 filter, approved by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, or better, should be used in the context of a comprehensive written respiratory protection program, which includes installation and fit testing, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort. The World Health Organization does not recommend the use of aprons, because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than being transmitted through body fluids.
The World Health Organization recommends only the use of a surgical mask for examination staff at the point of entry.
For those who collect respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients, take care of them, or transport them without any procedures to generate aerosols, WHO recommends the use of a surgical mask, goggles, or face shield, and cysts and gloves.
If an aerosol generation procedure is performed, the face mask is replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given that the global supply of personal protective equipment is insufficient, WHO recommends reducing the need for personal protective equipment through telemedicine, and physical barriers such as transparent windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to enter a room with a patient with symptoms of COVID-19, to use the personal protective equipment needed only for the specific task, and to continue to use the same breathing mask without removing it while caring for many patients with the same prophylactic chain.

Subject line: [COVID 19] Reducing the burden and preparing for the future
Date/Time of transmission: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
License: CC0: No rights reserved
We found ourselves in the midst of extraordinary circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic has become something that clearly demonstrates the global human interdependence and responsibilities we have towards others.
Our history has never seen similar challenges, but we know for sure that the best response depends on a kind of global compassion, cooperation and community building, which are at the heart of this institution.
The intense friendship and care we have seen among all our colleagues through emails, calls and conversations is a stunning demonstration of the amazing human emotions that, fortunately, surround our way of doing business.
I am deeply grateful and deeply proud to be your true colleagues.
Last week, someone sent me a letter to express their appreciation for our work.
They reminded me of how important it is for the world to be able to move towards Wikipedia right now, and the powerful symbolism that this critical resource remains available online and a kiss is available to everyone.
Your efforts have made it possible, whether it’s by keeping the sites running, getting our colleagues paid, or providing safety for our communities.
The world is in dire need of information on Wikipedia more than ever.
It is a moment in which the positive impact in the world is not only on our efforts, but also on the way we do them.
Because of the importance of this task and your role in it, we will make significant adjustments in how we work together starting next week.
Modifications to the method of work and schedules
As Robin mentioned earlier, Team C met yesterday to discuss our method and timeline for the coming days and months.
In that discussion, we looked at what we thought could be the appropriate response to what we’re facing, and the ideal way to keep the organization’s business sustainable during this period.
We wanted to get rid of stress and stress, and support our mission in the long run.
If you want to reduce the burdens and tasks, that’s fine.
For all employees, contractors and contract workers:
The expected daily working time is 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week until further notice.
We’re not announcing a vacation, and if you’re able to work longer than normal hours, you might add your efforts to the task.
However, the world is currently unpredictable, and whether you want to take care of your loved ones, get groceries or go to the doctor, your safety is our top priority.
We don't track your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
It should be understood that this is allowed without expressing it, but we mention it as a confirmation.
No sick leave or paid leave is required, just inform your manager and help your team review calendars and schedules to make sure key areas of work are covered.
(If your doctor has diagnosed you with COVID-19 positively, please tell Brian at the Department of Training and Certifications so that the Department of Training and Certification can help provide support and ensure that your case is properly cared for by the Department.)
Hourly fellows receive their full pay.
We have already mentioned this, and we renew this commitment to our contractors and fellow hourly workers.
Each employee will be paid based on normal working hours during normal circumstances.
This includes whether the employee is sick or unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Too many people are taking advantage of work to overcome the pressures that are rampant in the world around us.
What we can do will be amazingly productive, especially during difficult times like these.
Again, it’s about taking care of oneself.
We only ask you to contact your manager so that they know what to expect and adjust the procedures to adapt accordingly.
Some work is necessary.
There are also some things that we need to keep going.
Site reliability engineering teams, HR operations, trust, trust, fundraising (and others) are doing critical work, which may require further support.
We will begin a process in collaboration with all departments to assess current goals and shift our focus to supporting the elements necessary to achieve our mission.
There’s a lot of work to be done, and we’ll only focus on the most important projects.
Going slower now, won't hurt us later.
We don’t plan to “double the working time to fix what’s missing” after the pandemic is over.
It is not expected that we will work extra hours to meet the deadlines that are currently unrealistic.
We accept the fact that those circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new goals and timetables when appropriate.
What Happens in Annual Planning (APP)?
To adapt to the new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the delivery schedule for our annual planning for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose extending our 2019-2020 plan to allow more time for budget design to allow employees to prioritize critical work, self-care and loved ones while matching the situation of those who need or want to work within a reduced working hours schedule over the next few weeks.
This schedule extension eases the current planning workload and pressure across the entire organization.
We will present our proposal to the Board of Directors next week and will update delegates and teams on the next steps as soon as confirmation is obtained.
We thank the annual planning team for its leading role in this matter.
Office Status, Exposure and Cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco may have been infected with COVID-19.
However, out of extreme caution and ban, we hired a virus-resistant cleaning team to clear all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
The team has used a class antiviral solution used in hospitals to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the hallway and elevator units that lead to our floor.
The building implemented its duty-of-care protocol using products that support the safety of tenants.
We feel comfortable that the office is conveniently ready by the time we decide to return to work.
Our Washington, D.C. office is located in a WeWork building, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and with all members of the team working at our Washington, D.C. headquarters.
Starting last week, our Washington, D.C. office moved to a completely remote location under the joint guidance of our San Francisco office.
As some of our colleagues at our headquarters in New York City know, we had a discussion about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still ongoing but may be delayed for some time.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our long-time remote colleagues know it could be an adjustment, and they’ve wanted to give you some advice:
Meeting time should be limited to a maximum of one hour or a gradual increase of up to two hours.
If it takes longer sessions, think about how to divide them over several days.
The meeting should be clearly defined, an agenda prepared, and reading materials sent in advance.
Make video the default solution, and use tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and direct communication.
Each meeting should be facilitated by someone monitoring the conversation for questions, tracking the list of speakers, and someone else to help take notes (or implement a collaborative note-taking process).
An email should be sent to technical support when comfortable headphones are needed.
The health and safety compensation program can be used to get the cost of snacks.
Join the <0x23>remoties channel in the Slack app to talk to colleagues about distributed work
Our HR Operations team is looking for user-friendly, online meeting-based guidance to support the increase in business distributed across our organization.
Over the past week, we have asked all community grantees to cancel all public events funded by Wikimedia, such as Editathon, until the World Health Organization announces the end of the pandemic.
We have told them that we understand that our request for cancellations and other restrictions may make it impossible to complete agreed grant activities, and that no fines will be imposed on anyone due to the need to delay or modify these objectives.
Next week we will issue additional follow-up guidance on Wikimedia and other regional and thematic community conferences.
The general sentiments that prevail in the global community are confused by grief over disruption, complacency over clarity and the ability to focus on their communities, Wikimedia, and others.
Moving forward, the Crisis Response Team is designing a page on MetaWiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and follow up all communications with it.
Stay up-to-date on topics related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendar next Thursday, 14:00 UTC, 7:00 UTC for the staff meeting.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer questions, and spend time communicating with each other.
We are going through this experience together and are always ready to help as much as possible.
In the meantime, we may continue to obtain information from this email and all other necessary information related to COVID-19 available on the Office wiki.
The Crisis Response Team will keep these pages up-to-date and all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular contacts with personnel residing in severely affected States.
If you have any questions about travel, events, key areas of work, coverage challenges or anything else you need help with, please do not hesitate to inform us and cooperate with our Crisis Response Team.
We are always ready to provide support and communication as necessary.
If you have a confidential or sensitive issue, please send an email to Brian Gooden, International Human Resources Global Operations Manager.
Any such changes shall not be deemed to be a waiver of our business or our obligations.
Rather, it is an awareness in this present moment that our work and our commitments need to adapt in a way that we have not done in the past.
We believe these steps are necessary to support each other, so that we can continue to work and provide our employees with the support they need, and provide the world with the service they rely on.
The work we have planned will await us when the time comes to complete it.
Now is the time to help each other and create space for the important work that will come in the coming weeks and months.
We need all of you to make this happen, so we need all of you to take care of yourself and your family to be at your best when your efforts are needed.
Please wash your hands and do not touch your face!

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binds to the outer surface (cellular membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, and kidney, as well as the intestine.
Angiotensin-2-converting enzyme (ACE) counteracts the action of angiotensin-2-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-2 and increasing angiotensin (1-7); making it a promising drug in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. It is also an entry point for some types of coronary viruses into cells.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-2 converting enzyme is defined as a metal enzyme that contains the element zinc and is located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
Angiotensin-2-converting enzyme protein has an M2 peptidease scale that has an amino tip, and a carboxylic colictrine chain of the renal amino acid carrier tip.
Angiotensin-2 converting enzyme is a type 1 single-scrolling membrane protein, and has active enzyme receptors present on the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular part of the ACE2 converting enzyme is separated from the transmembrane by an enzyme called shidase, resulting in a soluble protein being released into the bloodstream and then excreted through urine.
Angiotensin-2 converting enzyme is found in most organs of the body: it is associated with the cell membrane of alveolar cells type 2 in the lung, in the intestinal cells of the small intestine, the endothelial cells of the arteries and veins, as well as in the smooth muscle cells of the arterial wall in most organs.
Angiotensin-2-converting RNA is present in the cerebral cortex, schema, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The primary function of the angiotensin-2-converting enzyme is to act as a counterweight to the angiotensin-converting enzyme.
Angiotensin converting enzyme stimulates the conversion of angiotensin 1 to angiotensin 2 adjuvant of blood vessels.
In contrast, the enzyme converting angiotensin-2 separates the carboxylic-amino-phenylalanine-containing endpoint from angiotensin-2 (aspartite-arginine-valin-tyrosine-isoleucine-histidine-proline-phenylalanine) and dissolves it into anhydrous.
Angiotensin-2-converting enzyme separates into a number of other peptides, including [des-arginine9]-pradriquinine, aplene, neurotensine, dinorphine A, and gerlin.
Angiotensin-2-converting enzyme also regulates the membrane passage of a neutral carrier of neutral neutral amino acids SLC6A19, and has a role in Hartnep disease.
Angiotensin-2 converting enzyme, as a transmembrane protein, is the main entry point into the cells of some coronary viruses, which include the human coronavirus NL63, SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS) and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
In particular, the association of the Spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with the enzymatic range of the enzyme converting ACE-2 on the cell surface leads to cellular fixation and the transmission of the virus and the enzyme to the internal particles located in the cells.
This process of introduction requires the synthesis of S protein by the host's transmembrane protease enzyme, serine2, which is still being tested as a potential treatment. This makes some assume that lowering levels of the enzyme converting to ACE2 in cells may help to fight off infection.
However, many specialist associations and self-regulatory bodies recommend continuing to use the usual angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers as a treatment.
A systematic study and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 showed that the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors was accompanied by a significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia by 34% compared to the reference group.
Furthermore, “the risk of pneumonia decreased among those who received treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and who were at higher risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke or heart failure.
“The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors has led to a decrease in the rate of death from pneumonia, although the results were less potent compared to the overall risk of pneumonia.”
The recombinant human angiotensin-2 converting enzyme (rhACE2) is thought to be a new treatment for acute lung injuries, as it has been found to improve the distribution of pulmonary blood, as well as oxygen saturation in pigs with acute shortness of breath syndrome induced by several fatty sugars.
The half-life of recombinant ACE-2 is approximately 10 hours, while its action begins after 30 minutes, as well as its continued effectiveness (time period) up to 24 hours.
There are numerous indications that recombinant angiotensin converting enzyme 2 may be a promising treatment for those with intolerance to conventional angiotensin resonance system inhibitors (RAS) and in diseases associated with elevated angiotensin 2 in the blood. There are clinical trials under evaluation, on the effect of enzyme infusion 2
COVID-19 applications are mobile software applications specifically designed to help track people in contact in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, meaning the process of identifying people (“contacts”) who may have been in contact with an infected person.
Numerous applications have been designed or proposed with official government support in some regions and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed to design applications to track contacts.
Many have expressed concerns about privacy, particularly about systems that rely on tracking the geographic location of app users.
Less intrusive alternatives to privacy include the use of Bluetooth signals to record user proximity to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they may integrate a functionality that supports these Bluetooth-based apps, directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay, has published an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
It is used by individuals in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, individuals use an app called TraceTogether.
A local IT association has designed the app, released it as an open source app and is due to be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched StopKorona, a Bluetooth-based app to track exposure to individuals with potential infections and provide rapid response to health care authorities.
The Ministry of Communications and Technology in collaboration with the Ministry of Health has taken over the design of the application.
On April 14, 2020, the app was still waiting to be approved by Apple’s Google Play Store and App Store.
On April 12, the government reported that the contact tracking app was in advanced development and could be available for distribution within weeks.Ireland and France are planning to launch a similar app, StopCovid.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering designing apps based on Singapore’s TraceTogether app, as well as the BlueTrace protocol.Russia intends to roll out an app that uses the virtual geosphere of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from Moscow residents, designed to make sure they don’t leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, has cited a number of potential practical problems surrounding application-based systems, including false positives and potential lack of effectiveness if the use of applications is limited to only a small segment of the population.
To address concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful coronavirus apps, Apple has imposed restrictions on the types of organizations that can add their own coronavirus-related apps to its App Store, limiting this to only “official” or other reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have voiced concerns about the consequences of mass surveillance resulting from the use of coronavirus applications, particularly with regard to whether or not the surveillance infrastructure designed to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will go away as soon as the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on this type of surveillance.
The organizations also announced eight conditions for government projects:
Monitoring should be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
Extensions of monitoring and surveillance should include provisions for determining when they will be stopped;
The use of data should be limited to the purposes of COVID-19;
Data security and the confidentiality of the identity of the data subjects should be protected and proven to be protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should avoid increasing discrimination and marginalization;
Any data sharing with third parties should be identified by law;
Protection against abuse and protection of citizens ' rights should be available to address abuse;
“Effective engagement” is required from all “stakeholders concerned”, including public health experts and marginalized groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also issued checklists.
Google/Apple’s proposed plan aims to address the problem of ongoing monitoring by removing the tracking mechanism from device operating systems as soon as they are no longer needed.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download the app and the possibility of avoiding tracking.
In Israel, officials have adopted network-based tracking.
But network-based solutions that have access to initial site data have potentially significant privacy issues.
However, not all centralized server systems need access to personal location data; a number of privacy systems have been created that use only centralized servers for intercoms (see next section below).
In South Korea, officials used a non-application-based system to carry out contact tracing operations.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collects tracking information from various sources, including mobile tracking data and card transaction data, and includes this data to send notifications via text messages to individuals with potential infections.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has also made the location information publicly available, which it has allowed due to wide-ranging changes to information privacy laws following the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus in that country.
This information is available to the public via a number of apps and websites.Countries, including Germany, have considered using both centralized and privacy-preserving systems.
On April 6, 2020, details on this matter have not yet been released.
Following privacy-friendly contacts is a successful concept supported by strong research literature dating back at least to 2013.On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups worked on privacy-friendly solutions, such as Bluetooth Low Power (PLE) to record user proximity to other cell phones.
However, BBB-PBT was a coordinated effort that contained both centralized and decentralized approaches, not an individual protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralised NAPs, DBPTs, DBPTs, DB-3Ts, and Temporary Contact Numbers (formerly known as TNCs).
In these protocols, personally identifiable data does not leave the device, and all matching processes occur on the device.
MIT Media Lab’s privacy group has been developing SafePaths, a platform to use privacy-saving technologies when collecting and utilizing location or junction data to track the spread of COVID-19.
Based on research from the March 2020 report “The Bad Face of Applications: Maintaining Personal Privacy in the Pandemic,” the SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies that also originally originated at MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure device technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and administrators without compromising data privacy.
On April 5, 2020, the Global Contact Number Tracking Coalition was founded by groups focused on what was essentially a similar approach and heavily overlapping protocols, aimed at reducing dispersion and enabling global interchangeability between tracking and alerting applications, a key feature for achieving widespread use.
On April 9, 2020, the Singaporean government announced that it had made the BlueTrace protocol, used by the official government app, open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the two companies that control Android and iOS mobile operating systems, announced an initiative to track contacts, claiming that they would maintain privacy by combining low-power Bluetooth with privacy-friendly encryption.
They also published the specifications of the main techniques used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the goal is to roll out the system in three stages:
Tools to enable governments to create official privacy-preserving apps to track coronavirus
Integrate this functionality directly into Android and iOS, and Google and Apple plan to resolve the use and ongoing monitoring issues by first distributing the systems through operating system updates and then removing them in the same way as soon as the threat ends.
A drug repositioning (also known as reuse, re-allocation, goal change or therapeutic transformation of the drug) is a repositioning of the use of an approved drug to treat a different disease or medical condition than originally designed to treat it.
This is a method of scientific research that researchers are currently pursuing to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research trends include the development of the COVID-19 vaccine and the transfer of plasma from RNAquine. SARS-CoV-2 contains approximately 66 drug-treatable proteins, each of which contains multiple binding sites.
The analysis of these binding sites provides a reasonable plan for the development of an effective antiviral drug that eliminates COVID-19 proteins.
Among the critical SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are two-door proteases, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, helicase, S protein, and RNA phosphatase for adenosine diphosphate.
Hussain A. A. and others studied several candidate compounds that were then refined and analyzed for their structure similarity to approved drugs with higher similarity, with the aim of accelerating the development of a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in his preclinical study to recommend in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is a malaria treatment drug that doctors also use to treat some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, World Health Organization announced that chloroquine and its associated hydroxychloroquine could be among four drugs subject to study as part of a clinical solidarity trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has announced that New York State trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may begin on March 24.On March 28, the Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
Treatment by the FDA’s clinical trial process was not approved and licensed under the Emergency Use License only as an experimental emergency use treatment for patients admitted to hospital but who could not receive treatment in the clinical trial.
The CDC announced that it has not yet determined “the use of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention, treatment, dosage or period of SARS-CoV-2 infection.”
Doctors said they use the drug when “there is no other option.”
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is currently conducting a small study on the use of chlorine in addition to zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Major studies are conducted at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
New York University’s Langone School of Medicine is conducting an experiment on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have claimed that favipiravir was “obviously effective.”
Of the 35 patients in Shenzhen, the test results were negative on an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study in Wuhan of 240 patients with pneumonia, half of them were given fafiberavir and the other half received omifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency has alerted people that the existing evidence supporting the drug is incomplete and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan to include it in its reserve stock, and would use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe had preliminary talks with the Trump administration about buying the drug.The drug may be less effective in treating the most severe cases where the virus has already doubled.
Its use may not be safe for pregnant women or women who want to get pregnant.
One study using lopinavir/ritonavir (caletra), a combination of the antivirals lopinavir and lopinavir, reported that the results “did not detect any benefit.”
The drugs were designed to inhibit HIV to prevent it from cloning by binding it to the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to reach a compound associated with SARS-CoV-2 protease.The scientific community is witnessing a state of criticism about channeling resources to redefine the purposes of drugs specifically designed to treat HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has added Lupinavir/Ritunavir to the international solidarity experiment.
Gilead Sciences has developed Remdesivir as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Gilead Sciences has subsequently discovered that Remdesivir has antiviral activity in the laboratory against several nematodes, mucous viruses and coronaviruses.
One of the problems with antiviral therapy is the development of resistance through transformations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preclinical studies suggest that Remacevir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance.There are several current clinical trials, including two conducted by the University of Cleveland Hospitals; one revolving around people with moderate illness, and the other is intended for patients with the most severe illness.
There are three clinical trials on antiviral vitamin C in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 disease, as well as two controlled placebo trials (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled trial (Italy).
New York State began trials on the effect of the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
Japan’s National Center for Public Health and Medicine (NCGM) plans to conduct a clinical trial on the use of Teijin’s Alvesco (cyclesonide), an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma, to treat patients with the novel coronavirus before symptoms appear.
A phase II trial using a form of ACE-2 is currently underway in 200 patients who are required to join the trial of acute hospitalisations in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called Colcorona, includes 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who doctors diagnosed with COVID-19 and who had mild symptoms without the need for hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant, breast-feeding, or who do not have an effective method of contraception are not eligible.
Many anticoagulants are also being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is currently widely used to treat patients, requiring the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidance on its use.
A multicentre study was announced in Italy on 300 patients to investigate the use of inoxaparin sodium in disease prevention and therapeutic doses on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, great scientific attention has been given to the reuse of approved antiviral drugs that have been designed to deal with past outbreaks such as the Mars virus, SARS virus, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Specialists recommend the use of Ribavirin for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th version of the Chinese directive
Omifenovir: Specialists recommended the use of omifenovir for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th version of the Chinese directive
Some antibiotics that specialists have identified as potentially reusable as treatments for COVID-19 include:
Tocilizumab (anti-interleukin receptor 6): Approved by China.
Experiences in Italy and China as well. See Tosilizumab<0x23>COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a presumed vaccine against the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Although no vaccines have been completed for clinical trials, several attempts are underway to develop this vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus, to be available in less than 18 months.
There were five vaccine candidates in the first phase of safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, leading to significant investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The requirements of the Coalition for Pandemic Preparedness Innovations for Vaccine Development, announced in April, are speed, manufacturing capacity, widespread deployment and global reach.
In April, the Coalition for Pandemic Preparedness Innovations reported that 10 different technology platforms were being researched and developed during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main objectives of the platform that progressed to the first phase of safety studies include:
DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid and RNA) (Phase I developer and candidate vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral carrier (phase 1 developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, Adenovirus type 5 carrier)
According to the Coalition for Epidemiological Preparedness Innovations in April, 115 total vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 active projects confirmed (79, according to the Milken Institute), and another 37 announced, but with little public information available (presumably in the planning phase or being designed).
The Phase I and II trial conducts an initial safety and immunization test, usually randomized, placebo-controlled, in multiple locations, with more accurate and effective dosing.
Phase III trials typically involve a greater number of participants, including the reference group, and a vaccine efficacy test to prevent the disease, while monitoring the adverse effects of the optimal dose.
Of the 79 candidate vaccines under active development (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 were not yet under human evaluation (still under investigation "preclinical").
Around January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the possibility of a molecular synapse vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins in order to trigger an immune reaction.
Around January 24, 2020 in Canada, the University of Saskatchewan’s Center for International Vaccines (VIDO-InterVac) announced the start of work on a vaccine, targeting the start of testing in humans in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
Around January 29, 2020, pharmaceutical companies Janssen, led by Hanneke Schweitmacher, announced that they had begun work on the development of a vaccine.
Janssen is involved in the development of an oral vaccine with her biotechnology partner, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a study on the design of a vaccine with a technology similar to that used to treat cancer with a novel antigen vaccine.

On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had formed a team with Novavax Inc.
In the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
Partners have also announced plans for pre-clinical testing and a Phase 1 clinical trial by July 2020.
On 12 March, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that it was working with 11 isolated cases, and that even as the pace of work accelerated it would take at least a year and a half to about two years to develop a vaccine.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a Quebec-based biotech company, reported that it was developing a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The candidate vaccine is subject to laboratory research, with plans to be tested in humans in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, the Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump offered CureVac “significant sums of money” for exclusive access to the COVID-19 vaccine, which the German government protested.
On March 17, 2020, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to participate in the development of a vaccine based on transmissible RNA.
The candidate RNA-based vaccine, BNT162, is currently undergoing pre-clinical testing with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on March 17, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotech company, announced that it would receive the results of pre-clinical tests in April 2020 and the final candidate vaccine could begin to have tests in humans by autumn.
In France on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Pandemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPA) announced a US$4.9 million investment in a consortium for COVID-19 vaccine research that includes the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, pushing the Alliance for Pandemic Preparedness Innovations’ total investment in the development of the US$29 million COVID-19 vaccine.
The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations partners for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Novavax, University of Hong Kong, University of Oxford, and University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing animals for six different candidate vaccines.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020, that they are developing a self-inflated RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The candidate vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced funding of C$275 million for 96 research projects on anti-COVID-19 medical measures, including several candidate vaccines at Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago initiatives and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million specifically for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to create a national “vaccine bank” of several new vaccines that could be used in the event of another coronavirus outbreak.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported tests for PittCoVacc, the potential vaccine for COVID-19 in mice, stating that "the SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines administered with microscopic needles elicited strong antigen-specific antibody responses [in mice] that were evident from 2 weeks after vaccination."
In Canada on April 16, 2020, the Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of Waterloo announced the design of a candidate vaccine based on deoxyribonucleic acid as a potential nasal spray.
Using phages, deoxyribonucleic acid will be designed to replicate inside human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to the virus, which could stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three universities pooled resources to access IBM’s supercomputers, along with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have different effects, also called unspecified effects.
This means that they can have benefits beyond the disease they are fighting.
Another randomized trial in Australia seeks to enroll 4,170 health care workers.
Vaccines that are being developed may not be safe or effective.
Early research to assess vaccine efficacy using specific animal models of COVID-19, such as angiotensin-2-converting transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, suggests the need for Tier 3 biosafety containment measures to deal with live viruses, and international coordination to ensure uniform safety procedures.
Anti-SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome vaccines have been tested on non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no cure or preventive vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS has been a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no approved vaccine against Middle East Respiratory Syndrome.
When March spread, it was thought that existing research on SARS might provide a useful model for the development of vaccines and treatments against Mars-Cove infection.
As of March 2020, there was one Middle East Respiratory Syndrome vaccine (based on deoxyribonucleic acid) that completed the first phase of clinical trials in humans, and three other vaccines are under development, all of which were virus-directed vaccines, and two adenovirus-directed vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, and BVRS-GamV vaccine).
Social media posts have sparked a conspiracy theory claiming that the virus causing COVID-19 was known and that the vaccine was already available.
Patents cited by many social media publications refer to existing patents for genetic sequencing and vaccines for other strains of coronaviruses such as SARS-causing coronavirus.
The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2)-associated coronavirus.
Common symptoms include fever, coughing, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell, and abdominal pain.
The period between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases show mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million people have been reported infected in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus spreads mainly among people during mixing, often through spray scattered when coughing, sneezing, or talking.
When spray is dispersed during exhalation, it usually falls to the ground or surfaces rather than being contagious over long distances.
People may also get infected when they touch a contaminated surface and then touch their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious in the first three days of onset of symptoms, although it may spread before the onset of symptoms and in the later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is the reaction of the polymerase sequence to the instantaneous reverse transcription (RT-PCR) through a nasopharyngeal swab.
Masks are recommended for those suspected of contracting the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the general public vary, with some authorities recommending their non-use, some deeming otherwise, and others requiring their use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
People with the virus may not have symptoms or exhibit flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath.
Immediate medical attention is advised if you develop emergency symptoms of difficulty breathing, pain or constant pressure in the chest area, disorder, difficulty waking up, or glaucoma of the face or lips.
In less common cases, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed in varying proportions.
At first, some cases in China suffered only chest tightness and palpitations.
In some, the disease may develop into pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is called the custody period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days but may range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of those who show symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection.
The role of carriers without symptoms in transmission has not yet been fully identified; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may be contributing to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people with no symptoms is currently unknown, and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases did not show symptoms during her hospital stay.
China’s National Health Commission began listing as asymptomatic cases in the daily tally on April 1; of the 166 cases that day, 130 (78%) had no symptoms at the time of testing.
Sputum and saliva may carry large proportions of the virus.
Speaking out loud results in more spray than speaking normally.
A study in Singapore has shown that coughing without covering the mouth can lead to a spray splashing up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) away.
Although the virus is not usually transmitted by air, the National Academy of Sciences has indicated that it can be transmitted via bio-aerosols, and testing samples of air pools in the hall outside the individual rooms has yielded positive results for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and CPR, may cause respiratory secretions to be released as a spray, and the virus then spreads through the air.
Although there are concerns that it may spread through the stool, that risk is thought to be limited.The virus is most contagious when people experience symptoms; while it may spread before symptoms appear, the risk is lower.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that despite some ambiguity about how easily the disease can spread, one person can infect two to three others overall. The virus remains stuck on surfaces from hours to days.
Specifically, the virus was found to remain present for one day on cardboard and for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on copper (99 percent).
However, this varies based on humidity and temperature.
Soaps and disinfectants are also effective provided they are used properly; the soap dissolves the virus’s protective lipid membrane and stops working, as well as clearing the skin and other surfaces from it.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical antiseptic), are less effective.In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken after an average of two days of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and on the second day of the test, the sixth patient showed the highest viral load.
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel SARS-associated coronavirus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia in the Wuhan acute respiratory disease group.
The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus shares its properties with the related coronaviruses found in nature.
Outside the body, household soap eliminates the virus, destroying its protective membrane. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the two organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus enters the host cells by the enzyme converting ACE2, the most abundant in alveolar cells of the second type found in the lung.
The virus uses a special superficial glycoprotein called a "spike" (Volvi division) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
12% of the infected people admitted to hospital in Wuhan, China, had severe heart attacks, which were more common in critical cases.
Rates of cardiovascular-related symptoms are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injury may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors have a very important role in the heart and are involved in performing its functions.
The rate of clots (31%) and venous blood clots (25%) in patients in the intensive care unit with COVID-19 has increased, which may be related to poor prediction of what the condition will be. An autopsy of individuals who died from COVID-19 found diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), and inflammatory embolism containing intra-respiratory lymphocytes.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is directed towards epithelial cells that express ACE2 in the respiratory system, severe COVID-19 patients experience symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, disease-causing T cells secreting GMCSF have been shown to be associated with bringing in the only cells secreting the inflammatory and degenerative lung disease Interleukin 6 in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphatic infiltration was also reported at the autopsy.
The World Health Organization has published several test protocols for the disease.
The RRT-PCR polymerase chain reaction is the standard test method.
The test is usually performed using respiratory samples taken from a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasopharyngeal swab or a phlegm sample can also be used.
Results are generally available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but this requires two blood samples by two weeks and the results are of minimal direct value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and spread genetic sequencing so that laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect the virus.
On April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which may detect active infection and whether a person has been infected in the past) were under development, but have not yet been widely used.
The Chinese experiment on the test showed that the accuracy is only between 60 and 70 percent.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first clinical care point test on March 21, 2020 for use at the end of that month. Diagnostic guidelines issued by the Zhongnan Hospital at the University of Wuhan suggested ways to detect infection based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risks.
Multi-lobe double-sided glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior spread are common features at the onset of the injury.
Subjunctive diffusion and the form of stone collocation (thickness of the lobular barrier with an uneven alveolar filler) may appear and merge with the development of the disease.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological conclusions of the autopsy:
Microscopy: Pleuritis, pericarditis, enlarged lung and pulmonary edema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pulmonary cell hyperplasia, atypical large alveolar cells, transient inflammation with lymphatic infiltration and formation of giant polynuclear cells
Acute pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar secretion.
Diffuse alveolar damage causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute hypoxia.
Treatment of pneumonia: regulation of secretions in alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC); white blood cell reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water frequently for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eye, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a napkin when coughing or sneezing, and it is recommended to use the inside of the elbow if a napkin is not available.
It is recommended to clean your hands thoroughly after any coughing or sneezing.
The CDC has recommended the use of canvas face coverings in public, in part to reduce transmission by those who do not show symptoms.Social distancing strategies aim to reduce the mixing of people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and eliminating large public gatherings.
Spacing guidelines also include that people walk at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away from each other.
There is no drug known to be effective in preventing COVID-19. As a vaccine is not expected to be invented until 2021 at the earliest, the main part of controlling COVID-19 is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, which is known as “curve flattening”.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands repeatedly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands are clearly dirty, before eating, and after cleaning the nose, coughing, or sneezing.
It is also recommended to use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol, when soap and water are not available only.For areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, WHO offers two formulations for local production.
Antimicrobial activity arises in these two formulations from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is “not an effective hand sanitizer”.
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People receive supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and assistance to other vital organs affected.
CDC recommends that people who suspect they have the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygen (ECMO) is used to treat respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive therapies may benefit those with mild symptoms during the early stage of the infection. The World Health Organization and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of those hospitalized for COVID-19.
U.S. intensive care professionals and lung pathologists have collected treatment recommendations from various bodies in a free resource, the online Critical Care Book.
As of April 2020, no specific treatment for COVID-19 has been available.
For symptoms, some specialist doctors recommend using paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen as the first treatment.
Take precautions to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health care settings when performing procedures that may result in a spray, such as intubation or manual breathing.
For health care professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing a person in the isolation room from airborne infections (AIRs) as well as using standard precautions, mixing precautions and airborne disease precautions.The CDC outlines guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (BPE) during the pandemic.
Recommended tools: PPE aprons, a respirator or face mask, eye protectors, and medical gloves. Respirators (instead of face masks) are preferred when available.
The N95 respirators have been approved for industrial installations, but the Food and Drug Administration has authorized the use of masks under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against a particular biological agent is uncertain in the case of uses for other unspecified purposes.
When masks are not available, CDC recommends using face protectors or homemade masks as the last resort.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so degraded that they require artificial respiration or replacements, but some cases do.
The type of respiratory support provided to those with COVID-19-related respiratory failure in hospital is actively studied, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided using high-flow nasal cannula or bi-level positive airway pressure.
It is not known whether either option is of the same benefit to those suffering from a critical condition.
Some doctors prefer to continue using invasive respiration when available because this technique reduces the prevalence of aerosol particles compared to the high-flow nasal cannula. Critical conditions are frequent among older adults (those over 60 years of age, especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, restricting the health system’s ability to cope with the sudden rise in the number of serious COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% required artificial respiratory support, and 1.4% of cases died.
In China, nearly 30% of those hospitalized due to COVID-19 end up in intensive care units.
Ventilation becomes more complicated as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in people with COVID-19 and oxygen supply becomes more difficult.
Respirators need to have pressure control and high positive terminal exhalation pressure to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of respiratory and pneumothorax-related lung injury.
High positive expiratory pressure may not be available in older respiratory systems.
The search for potential therapies began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in the clinical trial phase.
RemedySepher seems to be the most evangelical.
Although new drugs may take until 2021 to develop, many of the drugs being tested have already been approved for other uses or are already at an advanced stage of testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tried in people with a critical condition.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that volunteers participate in trials of the efficacy and safety of potential therapies. The Food and Drug Administration has granted a temporary license to use convalescence plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where a person’s life is seriously or directly threatened.
Has not undergone the necessary clinical studies to prove that it is safe and effective against the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak.
Users are required to enter their name and ID number.
The app is able to detect ‘contacts’ using surveillance data and thus the risk of potential infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but also alerts local health officials.Big data analytics for mobile data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and those they have mixed up with in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled the security services to track the mobile phone data of those it assumed were infected with the coronavirus.
The measure was taken to impose quarantine and protect those who are likely to contact injured citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared phone location data collected with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, for research purposes and to prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has used facial recognition technology to detect quarantine offenders.
Italian regional health commissioner Giulio Galera said mobile phone companies told him that “40 percent of people are still moving everywhere.”
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackathon on a weekend in which more than 42,000 people participated.
The President of Estonia, Kirsty Kaljulaid, has also made a global call for innovative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may feel distressed by quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of injury itself.
According to Rory O’Connor, “Increasing social isolation, loneliness, anxiety about health, stress and economic stagnation is a devastating storm that is detrimental to people’s mental health and well-being.”
The disease may take a mild course with minor or asymptomatic symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases such as a cold.
Minor cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 based on data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but there is still a lack of data for COVID-19.
In the most severely affected, COVID-19 may rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to respiratory failure, septic shock, or multi-organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 are sepsis, abnormal blood clotting, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Six percent of people with COVID-19 who were hospitalized were diagnosed with an anomaly of blood clotting, specifically an increase in prothrombin time, while four percent had impaired kidney function.
Approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have high levels of liver enzymes (aminotransferases).
According to the same report, the average period between onset of symptoms and death was 10 days, including five days in hospital.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death for those transferred to the intensive care unit was seven days.
In a study of early cases, the average period from the onset of initial symptoms to death was 14 days, and total cases ranged from six days to 41 days.
In a study conducted by the National Health Commission (NHC) in China, the mortality rate for men was 2.8% while the mortality rate for women was 1.7%.
Histological anatomical examinations of postmortem lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage with fibromexide cellular secretions in both lungs.
Changes in viral cellular morbidity have been observed in alveolar cells.
A lung image shows acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Heart damage due to elevated troponin levels or cardiac arrest was observed in 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China.
According to data from the U.S. in March, 89% of those hospitalized had previous conditions.The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic status of the region may also affect deaths.
Estimates of deaths from the condition vary as a result of these differences between regions, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Underestimation of minor cases may lead to an overestimation of mortality from the truth.
However, the fact that previous cases have caused deaths may indicate that the current mortality rate is lower than the reality.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and 2.4 times more likely to be in need of intensive care and die than non-smokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority has revealed a 20 to 30 percent reduction in lung capacity in some recoveries, and lung tests have indicated damage.
It may also cause post-intensity care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether or not the previous infection gave those recovering from the disease an effective and long-term immunity.
Immunity acquisition is seen as probable, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but it was announced that there were cases that recovered from COVID-19 and then contracted again later.
These conditions are thought to worsen if the infection persists rather than if it recurs.
The virus is believed to be natural and of animal origin, given the spread of infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was largely due to its human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed that December 1, 2019 is the first date for the onset of symptoms.
Official WHO publications have reported that December 8, 2019 is the first date for symptoms to appear.
Many measures are usually taken to determine the number of deaths.
These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the size of the examinations, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the time taken since the outbreak began and population characteristics such as age, gender and public health.
In late 2019, in the 10th review of the International Classification of Diseases Emergency Code U 07.1 for laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 deaths and U 07.2 for diagnosed COVID-19 deaths during the SARS-CoV-2 clinical or epidemiological period without laboratory-confirmed mortality.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the global mortality rate is 6.9 percent (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
The number varies by region. Other metrics include the case mortality rate (CFR), which is the percentage of people who have been diagnosed with and died from disease, and the IFR, which is the percentage of people who have been diagnosed (who have been diagnosed and who have not been diagnosed).
These statistics do not have a time frame, and they follow a specific population range from infection to finding out the fate of the condition.
Although antibodies may not be produced by the bodies of all infected, their presence may provide information about the number of infected.
At the epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, Castell<0xC3><0xB3>n de Ada, a small village of 4,600 people, already 80 people (1.7%) have died.
In Djanglet, the disease spread due to carnival festivals, and spread to young people, causing a relatively lower mortality rate, and perhaps not all COVID-19 deaths were officially classified as a result of it.
Moreover, the German health system was not exhausted.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, according to a blood donor evaluation.
69 deaths (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed due to COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the resulting mortality rate varies between men and women.
The mortality rate is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is at age 50, with the difference between men and women only disappearing at age 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact causes of these sexual differences are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be a cause.
Gender-based immunological differences, the prevalence of smoking among women and the incidence of concurrent conditions such as high blood pressure at a younger age than women may have contributed to a higher mortality rate in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not track sex-disaggregated data for COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
The highest proportion of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they have an increased risk of HIV infection.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the official name of the disease is COVID-19.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that Co is an abbreviation of the word corona, and in the abbreviation for virus Wd is an abbreviation for disease and 19 refers to the year of first detection of the outbreak: December 31, 2019.
The name has been chosen to avoid referring to a specific geographical location (such as China), animal species or group of people, in line with the international recommendations of the label aimed at preventing stigma.The virus that causes COVID-19 is called the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
In addition, the World Health Organization (WHO) uses the terms “COVID-19” and “COVID-19” in public statements.
The disease and virus are commonly referred to as the "coronavirus".
During the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as the “Coronavirus” and “Coronavirus Wuhan”.
In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended the use of the names novel coronavirus-2019 and novel coronavirus-related acute respiratory disease-2019 as temporary names for the virus and the disease in accordance with the 2015 guidelines that prohibit the use of sites in disease and virus names.
Official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to limited capabilities in standard supply chains, digital industrial companies export healthcare materials such as nose swabs and respiratory device parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a respirator valve and the supplier could not deliver on time, a local startup reversed its engineering and issued the required 100 valves in one night.
After the first outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misinformation regarding the origin of the disease, its scope, prevention, treatment and other aspects emerged and quickly spread online.
Humans seem to be able to transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of virus proliferation in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There are no approved drugs or vaccines to treat the disease.
Government institutions, academic groups and industry researchers are conducting international research on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines.
In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a “solidarity trial” to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds that are most effective and promising.
No vaccine is available, but various bodies are actively developing candidate vaccines.
Previous studies of SARS-CoV are used because it resembles SARS-CoV-2 in the use of ACE2-receptors to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are subject to study.
First, the researchers aim to create a full-fledged vaccine for the virus.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to provoke an immediate immune response in the human body against a new infection with COVID-19.
The second strategy, the Partial Unit Vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to certain partial units of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the Spike S protein, which helps the virus break into the ACE2 receptor.
The third strategy is DNA vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technology for vaccine innovation).
The experimental vaccines produced by any of these strategies should be tested for safety and effectiveness.On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine was started on four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease.Antibody-dependent bullying has been cited as a potential challenge to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine innovation, but this is controversial.
There are more than 300 active clinical trials underway as of April 2020.
Seven trials of already approved treatments for malaria have been evaluated, including four studies involving hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The proposed re-use of antiviral drugs in the treatment of the new disease accounts for most of China’s research, with nine phase III trials on Remdesivir across several countries due to be reported by the end of April.
A dynamic review of the clinical development of potential COVID-19 vaccines and drugs has been conducted as of April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are being evaluated, including rimdecifer, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lupinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir combined with interferon beta.
There is tentative evidence of the efficacy of rimdesivir, as of March 2020.
Clinical improvement has been observed in patients treated with Remdesivir for euthanasia.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the United States, China and Italy.Chloroquine, formerly used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, and has preliminary results.
However, there are calls for peer review for research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Virus Research Institute notes that despite recommending a dose of 1 gram, the weakness of this dose is extremely dangerous and may cause death.
On March 28, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration issued a license for the emergency use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating those with COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Further study of the effect of nitazoxanide on organisms was recommended after demonstrating inhibition of low SARS-CoV-2 concentration.Studies have shown that initial synthesis of the Spike protein via transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMBRS2) is necessary for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with the ACE2-receptor.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have significant deficiencies that have prevented the medical community from accepting these treatments without further study.Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine storm may be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine storm properties.China's National Health Commission added to the treatment guidelines after completing a small study.
He is undergoing a non-random phase 2 test at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe conditions.
In addition to being used in serum ferritin testing to identify cytokine storms, it aims to counteract such developments, which are believed to be the cause of death in some people.
The Food and Drug Administration has approved interleukin-6 antireceptor therapy with chimeric antigen-receptor T-cell therapy, based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of cytokine secretion syndrome for nonsteroid responders with a different cause in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized, disciplined evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for cytokine secretion syndrome.
The method of transfer of the purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of those recovering from COVID-19 is subject to those who need them for study as a non-vaccine method of negative vaccination.
This strategy was tested on SARS and its results were inconclusive.
Neutralization of the virus represents the expected mechanism of action by which negative antibody therapy can act as a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-based cellular toxicity, phagocytosis, or both may be used.
Other forms of negative antibody therapy, such as the use of manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are under development.
The production of estrogen, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovering patients and contains antibodies to the virus, can be increased to spread faster.
Corona virus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wen Liang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, was later injured and died of COVID-19 after drawing attention to the spread of the virus.
