USA Gymnastics supports the letter of the U.S. Olympic Committee and accepts the Olympic family's absolute need to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, can be better served by making progress with significant changes within our organization, rather than by removing certification.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but provides details that fossils generally cannot give, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
. Scientists claim that the feathers of this animal were chestnut-coloured brown at the top and the bottom is light or carotenoid-coloured.
The finding also provides information on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called rachis, but have other feather characteristics — "barbs" and "barbules" — researchers have deduced that rachis was likely an evolutionary development that occurred after these other characteristics.
The feather structure suggests that they were not used for flying but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers have suggested that, although this is the tail of a small dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and not small thin, soft feathers.
The researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and not the fur of a chick.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty people.

The brightness and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in relation to the magnetic reversal.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to stimulate the observations made by the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Sant'Anna Street.
Just as the moon has a tug on the ground, causing tides, so does the Street of St. Anna exert force on the galaxy of Sagittarius.
Scientists have come to the conclusion that dark matter affects other dark matter as does regular matter.
This theory states that the majority of dark matter around a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a type of diadem and is made up of many small particles.

Dr Tony Moll discovered Extremely Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said the new variant was "extremely disturbing and alarming due to the very high rate of fatalities."
Dr Moll thinks that, some patients may have taken the bug from the hospital, and at least two were hospital health workers.
Within one year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.

Their thermal behavior is not as constant as large caves on Earth that often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with that these are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University team located in Flagstaff.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a cab and place a sheet of preprinted paper indicating the candidate of their choice in an envelope.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs the list of voter names.
The French electoral law codifies the proceedings in a rather strict manner.
As early as 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelopes are present at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added except those of voters duly counted and authorised.
Candidates may send representatives to testify at any part of the process.In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strong supervision, according to specific procedures.

Her first was the Slalom, where she achieved "Did Not Finish" (Not Finished) in her first run. 36 of the 116 competitors had the same result in that race.
In her other race, the Giant Slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's sitting group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the Austrian Claudia Loesch who took first place and 1:09.02 minutes slower than Gyöngyi fidayi of Hungary.
Four skiers in the women's seating group failed to finish their laps, and 45 of the 117 total skiers in the Giant Slalom did not rank in the race.
Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the laptop and mobile phone that had been stolen.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop".
The accused are named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rambro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with his face covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car collided with her, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious injuries to his head.
The road where the crash occurred was temporarily closed as emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Afterwards, he was transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court accused of murdering her son.
She is in custody until she is charged and tried, but any testimony of ocular witnesses may be influenced because a photograph of her has been widely published'.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK but Scottish justice works differently and courts consider the publication of photographs to be potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem to be in danger if they publish photos etc of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is generally in charge of prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made at least before the indictment.
The document, according to the disclosure, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants based on borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other covered topics reported to include the future state of Jerusalem which is sacred to both nations and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continued military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed while the PA agrees to leave this presence for only five years.
Tierra tions in the supplementary pest control trial had to be closely monitored by forest rangers, as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership of NPWS and Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited, under the Sporting Shooters Association's (Sporting Shooters Association) hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Parks Conservation and Heritage with NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first firing operation received comprehensive instruction in safety and training.
Martelly sworn in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP (Provisional Electoral Council) in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were due to take place in 2011.
About 60 cases of damaged iPods due to overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been informed about the 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "non-serious."
The ministry responded by calling the postponement of the report by Apple "really regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
The Northern Marianas emergency management office said there were no reported damages in the nation.
In addition, the Tsumani Pacific Warning Center said there was no indication of Tsunami.
A Filipino former policeman has detained Hong Kong tourists as hostages by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle in the direction of the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as well as Filipino photographers.
Photographers later took the place of an elderly woman because she needed to use the toilet. Mendoza was killed with firearms.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
He was trained as an obstetrician and began working at the Auckland Women's National Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature childbirth during his free time.
His research showed that administering a hormone speeds up the maturation of the baby's fetal lung.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday government investigators found two 'black boxes' that are the flight recorders.
Her fellow lotteries also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Indeed unique like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as unusual as me...maybe even more than me...love her and miss her...hope she's in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those who opposed Australia becoming a republic have increased by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, provisional Prime Minister Julia Gillard asserted that she believes Australia should become a republic when the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ends.
34 percent of those polled agree with this view, and want Queen Elizabeth to be Australia's last monarch.
In the extremes of voting, 29 percent of those polled believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The winner of the Olympic gold medal was expected to swim in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and three Commonwealth Games relays, but due to his complaints there were doubts about his state of health.
He could not take the necessary medicines for his pain as they are banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number by January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software by early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets have been a source of water delivery to the world along with organic matter that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, since comets collided with the Earth many years ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalising same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "parols and political stupidity".
It is speculated that he will present a candidacy for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
This uses satellite-based technology as opposed to old ground-radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to identify aircraft with greater accuracy and give pilots more accurate information.
No extra transport is being put in and ground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and "park-and-ride" facilities are not available on the ground.
Fears of lack of transport have raised the possibility of forcing the game to be played with closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal "Science" provided a report on the creation of new bird species in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species has evolved in just two generations, although this process was thought to have lasted much longer, due to mating between endemic Darwin spons, Geospiza fortis, and impudent sponser Geospiza k.
Gold can be made into any kind of shape. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be pulled into a thin wire, which can then be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can become very thin, and be attached to another metal. It can become so thin that it was sometimes used for decorating hand painted pictures in books called "lite manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ions (H at pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed from them (since Hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Turn the two dry powders together and then, with wet and clean hands, press them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the homes of the Minoan towns of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, ancient Persia and ancient China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bath houses where men and women met together in a mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and subsequently reflects it back down, almost instantaneously.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and view.
A giant rocket more than 100 feet long is needed to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The bike has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing that the bike has done for us is that it has given us easier and faster transportation.
It brought with it the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Below them are more medium-sized cats who eat the medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antilopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including cats that are free pets) who eat a much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a special task that each cat has and that prevents it from competing with the others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups that are called "prides" in English.
The groups ("prides") are composed of one to three related adult masks, plus a maximum of thirty females and offspring.
Women, in general, are closely related to each other, as they are a large family of siblings and daughters-in-law.
Lion groups act like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) in behavior, and are also very deadly to their prey.
A good athlete in all things, the tiger can climb (although not very well), swim, jump great distances and draw five times the force of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jacquards.
The tiger's gargle is not like the gargle with a lion's loud voice, but rather like a sentence of bulkyly-called words.
Ocelots love to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that hunt them the ocelot are much younger than him.
Scientists think that ocelots follow and find animals to feed them (prey) with the smell, smelling the ground where they were.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and move in hiding, too. Osselllots hunt their prey by blending with their surroundings then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of living things (small population) is separated from the main population from which they came (such as if they move over a mountain or river range, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot move back easily) they often find themselves in a different environment than they were before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different features or adaptations to be a strong competitor instead of what they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, they still require the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they will not even be able to be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and an important part of evolution.
Plants create the oxygen that humans inhale, and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes from plants and we make clothes from plants. Many food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals can no longer live.
The mosaic was the predator of the peak of his time, so he was not afraid of anything, except other mosaics.
Her long jaw was filled with more than 70 sharp teeth, as well as another set of years on the roof of her mouth, which means that anyone who came along her path had no chance of getting scratched.
His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosaics, and he may have also been a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that got into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex would not have won.
While the majority of their food is familiar to us, the Romans actually had a number of strange or unusual holiday items, including wild boar, pawn, snails, and a kind of mouse-like rodent that sleeps very much.
Another difference was that while the poor people and the woman ate their food sitting on the chairs, the rich men liked to have dinner together where they would swam on their side while they ate their food.
Ancient Rome's meals could not include food that came to Europe from America or Asia in the following centuries.
For example, they had no wheat, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods that was considered the house of the god.
The people took sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard in the temple and, behind it, an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Special towers in the form of pyramids, called ziggurats, were sometimes built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, home was not so important.
The majority of the Jewish family's life was in the open.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were simply an open canteen facing the street. The stones were used for building houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland had a small population. In the Norwegian sagas it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But, regardless of the discovery he made, at that time the Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each country was 'Scandinav', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you saw the film "National Treasure", you might think there was a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its history, the large parchment-made document ( measuring 293<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4 inches by 241<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
So, it is likely that the notation was added simply as a label.
D-Day landings and the ensuing battles had liberated northern France, but the south still remained unfree.
It was led by the French "Vichy" . These were French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks the Americans and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were turning towards Germany.
Civilization is a singular culture shared by a large and significant group of people who live and work cooperatively, society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin words civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and which in a certain way also defines the size of society.
Cities that are states are the precursors of nations. A civilizational culture implies the transfer of knowledge from various generations, a persistent cultural footprint and a fair spread.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as appropriate civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—whereupon Congress was its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities to enforce all its acts but, often, they did not cooperate.
He had no power to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
Articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended and states did not take central government so seriously that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the samples of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, waterpolo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motorcycle racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international matches and Olympic events.
The Japanese have almost 7,000 islands (the largest one is Honshu) and, therefore, this makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands in Japan, Japan is often referred to, on a geographical position, as an "archipelago."
The beginning of Taiwan dates back to the early 15th century where European sailors passing through it recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan, starting a transformation into aboriginal wheat production practices and employing Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the coastal areas of western and northern Taiwan and declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after a defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
A large part of the buildings at the edges of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a clearer idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common fixed image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the close of the analog film era.
It is still being produced today but, more importantly, its aspect ratio has come from digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is currently, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide with a height of 24mm.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to achieve the most simple integer ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, a family of APS formats) are equal to or very similar to this aspect ratio.
The highly abused and ridiculed third-party rule is often a simple guideline that creates dynamism while keeping a measure of order in an image.
This states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years the Christian religion has united European states despite differences in language and customs. I
His great power affected everyone from the king to the common herdsman.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds are there specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years and this concentration of power and money led many people to question whether this principle was being met.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, halting vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain has undermined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, causing danger even to neutral ships.
As there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its submarine war without restrictions.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were those of pacifism and isolation.
Having seen the terrible things and atrocities of war during the First World War, the nations wished to avoid such a situation happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to the United States of America to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents on his name, a poem book, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former job manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing the different periods of time; each stage of China and every family that had power were distinctive dynasties.
Also between each dynasty there was a time of instability with divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the 60-year reign of the Three Kingdoms between the Han and Jin Dynasty.
During these periods of time there was a fierce war between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China where thousands of people died fighting to take the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not just one ruler.
Even after the Revolution, jobs were opened to all male applicants and this allowed those who were most ambitious and capable to succeed.
The same is true for the military because instead of being class-based, the army's rankings were now calibre-based.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people of the oppressed working class of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters beyond this mundana life. He frequented a cave that became known as "Hira" on the Mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived through time, clearly shows Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
On the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find anything even if someone knows it exists. Once you enter the cave, there is total isolation.
Nothing can be seen except a clear and beautiful sky above and the many mountains around it. Little of this world can be seen or heard from within the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exist to this day.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor the deceased Pharaoh.
The Plateau of Giza, or "the Necropolis of Giza" in the Valley of the Egyptian Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small crypts, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, crypts and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and relatives.
The "play up" mark looks like a V and the "play down mark" looks like a staple or square shape without the bottom.
Up means you have to start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you have to start at the frog (the place where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
The up-play of a stringed instrument generates a softer sound, while down-playing is louder and more assertive.
You can make the marks you want with pencils, but remember that the bowing marks are there for a musical reason and therefore, usually, they have to be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two sons (Marie Therese aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged four) and the King's sister, Mrs. Elizabeth, terrified, were forced to return to Paris on 6 October 1789 by women of Versailles riots.
They travelled back to Paris in carriages surrounded by a crowd of people screaming threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to keep their car windows open.
At one point a member of the crowd shook the head of the royal guard who was killed in Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The war expenses of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to pay most of the expenses and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine bank through Wall Street banking institutions.
Of course, the superprofits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people constitute the basic achievements of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars you must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The time at which events commonly occurred was called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
Before the High Middle Ages there was the Early Middle Ages which was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is agreed to end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Many interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that cars necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning the car.
Mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher occurrence of road accidents, leading to the invention of new healthcare techniques for repairing damaged cars.
Romanticism had a great element of cultural determinism, taken from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography formed individuals and, over time, resulted in customs and culture related to that geography, and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than laws imposed arbitrarily.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital in the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered to be the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
His fame as a luxury epicentre began around 400 A.D. and lasted until around 1100 A.D.
Its status worsened during the twelfth century, largely due to the fact that the Crusaders had returned carrying gifts such as silk and spices that were valued more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
At this time it became the transfer of the title of Mode Capital from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th to 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, clothing had a great influence from the Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, because communication channels move slowly, styles in the West can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop its own style. one of the biggest developments of the time as a result of the Crusades was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture carried out for the production of enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system that uses lifted seed that is native to the ecoregion along with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to take maximum yield.
Historically many farmers have been involved in subsistence agriculture and this is still applicable in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel forgotten by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinctive due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership using a different and symbolic style, which includes ways, manners, and language.
One of the most commonly used methods to demonstrate the importance of socialisation is to use a few unfortunate cases of children who, due to negligence, distortion or intentional abuse, have not been socialised by adults as they were growing up.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases this abandonment of the child was due to the parents' refusal of serious intellectual or physical impairment of the child.
Wild children may have experienced child abuse or severe trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
Others are alleged to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild alone.
When fully reared by non-human animals, the wild child exhibits behaviour (within physical limits) almost entirely like that of the particular animals that cared for him, such as his fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the learning method called scaffolding is more effective.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but, rather, an aid that provides support to individuals undergoing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a kind of scaffold but even the small paper clip man in Microsoft Office is a scaffold.
Virtual Scaffolding is internalized in software and aims to ask, prompt, and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the student to manage on their own.
Children are placed in Foster Care for a wide variety of reasons involving negligence, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but that still happens.
We consider the Fostering Care System as a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, caretakers offering their love, stable education, and reliable health care.
The poster care is supposed to provide all the needs that were missing in the home that were taken from it before.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinct features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the uses and satisfactions approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "continuous relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, surface movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that one can detect whether a person is lying by interpreting micro-expressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper "The President's Speech", indicated how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are, however, able to accurately assess sincerity.
It even suggests that such skills in interpreting human behavior also exist in animals such as pet dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and the selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two groups with each generation.
In savannas, it is difficult to primate with a digestive system such as that of humans to meet its amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
In addition, failure to do so has serious consequences: reduced growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the accessible proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but provides a high quantity of proteins containing all essential amino acids.
Considering everything, we should not be surprised that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" almost in the same way as today's chimpanzees who live in the savage.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep a little later (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet whistleblower that brings you to your senses without completely waking you up.
If you find yourself setting the clock while you sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, causing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other alternatives on the basis of biorhythms involve drinking plenty of fluids (particularly water or tea, a popular diuretic) before bedtime, causing the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace that a person has is correlated in a opposite way with the amount of tension in the person's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the present life force. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and happiness.
Everyone can become enlightened. The only obstacle to this is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but they were expanded with Mahayana's love path and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
As a principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Yoga Kundalini, meditation and the idea that love accepts everything.
With Kundalini Yoga the energy of Kundalini (enlightened energy) is raised through yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of the Gods. Through the visualization of various gods one cleans energy channels, activates chakras and creates a consciousness of illumination.
Germany was still commonplace in World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the end of the war disagreements in system, process and culture led to countries fighting.
Just two years after the end of the war, former allies have now become enemies and the Cold War has begun.
It had to last for the next 40 years and had to be fought for real, by alternative armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defence was already divided, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganise itself along the Romanian bridge.
However, these plans became almost obsolete from today to tomorrow, when more than 800,000 soldiers from the International Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and created the multiple fronts of Belarus and Ukraine after they invaded both the eastern regions of Poland, in violation of the Treaty of Peace of Riga and the Treaty of Nagorno-Karabakh.
The use of ships for freight transport is undoubtedly the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods to cross the oceans.
The work of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and objects, while at the same time, interfering with your enemy's ability to move its people and objects.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, which mainly uses U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to defeat Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
It turns out that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in Iran's Zagros Mountains.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to retain them to have an easy way of acquiring milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in flocks that graze along hills or other pasture areas, and were often attended by goat herders who were often children or adolescents, similar to the more well-known sheep herders.
Wagonways were built in England in the early 16th century.
Although the wagonways consisted simply of parallel planks of wood, they allowed horses to pull them to achieve greater speeds and pull larger loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the time.
The "crossties" (crossed knots) were introduced quite early to keep the tracks in place. However, gradually, it became realisation that the tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron strip at the top.
This became a common practice, but iron caused more wear on wooden cart wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first completely iron lines were introduced.
The first known means of transport was walking, humans began to walk upright two million years ago when Homo Erectus (meaning man standing) appeared.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus did not walk upright habitually.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the Sahelanthropus may have walked on two feet even from seven million years ago.
We can start to live more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can also be activists in order to reduce future suffering to some degree.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, we should find the source of the problems, and we should disable it.
It is obvious enough that the world has changed greatly because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and problems have become greater because of humanity's overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle.
Following its adoption by Congress on July 4, the handwritten and signed bill by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away at John Dunlap's printing shop.
Overnight between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "the Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the Independence Hall courtyard on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who ordered it to be read to his troops in New York on 9 July.
The 25 dunlap broadsides still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still exists today. We call them birds.
Many people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have peeled legs and tipped nails, they lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like T-Rex.
Practically all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one value out of two, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, in computer language.
Internal poisoning may not appear immediately. Symptoms such as vomiting are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from ancient familiarity with the Cocoa, which are very suitable insects as human parasites.
Both Assassin-bugs and Bed-bugs are nidicules, suitable for living in a nest or in the location of their host.
Across the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the interest of their child, to raise a child.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main purpose of science is to understand the way the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides a lot of scientific research.
However, experimentation is not alone, and an experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, to ask questions, and to make observations is also a guide to scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all subjects of science, including psychology, were accepted.
When knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West found itself detached from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic indications, have been documented for most living creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a period of free-running cycling even without external indications.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA inside a bacterium.
They did two experiments by marking either the DNA in the bacteriophagus with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
The mutations may have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material and whether the affected cells are germ line cells.
Only mutations in germ line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the scenery, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visits to parks and the study of ecosystem information.
An example of this is to visit, take photos, and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the country's small towns with cars to go to work and pass by other people whose place of work is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle everyone, in some way, is connected to, and supports, a transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar levels of murmuring about water quality or falling bridges.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two locations and the interactions they make with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is difficult because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows tend to have reasonable consistency and can be roughly mathematically represented.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships were established between the three main features: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to start flying. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and find food and partners more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back into place along their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold back their wings are mazzarells and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This seems reasonable, because the world doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world, carrying more than 8 times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, at some points having a width of six miles.
In total, 20 percent of all water that is poured from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Ancient Kingdom, the Giza pyramids remained the largest in size and the best in technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were marvellous with the monuments of their predecessors who, at that time, were well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican City has a population of around 800 and is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by many of those working in the state while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have long known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since antiquity, as they can all be discovered in nature in an indigenous form and it is relatively simple to dig for them in mines through primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, came up with the theory that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, though he also theorizes that they turn into new substances to form what we see.
The alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You may also have an alloy that includes small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made up of matter. Every matter is made up of very small particles that are called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly miniscule that trillions of them sit at the point at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods emerged, pencils were relegated to a lower status and less use.
People now write messages on computer screens, and they never have to approach temprina.
Who knows what will become of the keyboard when something new is invented.
The fission bomb works on the principle of taking energy to a nucleus to combine with many protons and neutrons.
In a similar way as when pushing a heavy cart on a climb. The nucleus splitting again then releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means they tend to divide with little or no effort.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The shell is about 70 km wide on the nearest side and 100 km wide on the farthest side.
It is thinner under the "maria" and thicker under the "highlands".
There may be more lunar seas on the adjacent side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered on finding out what makes people happy or attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized when they mature into adulthood.
These theories analyze what makes certain people want the things they want and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, two types of attitudes can arise when managers begin to manage their former peers. One end of the spectrum is to try to keep feeling like one of them.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, performs disciplinary action, performs evaluations, assigns responsibilities, and sees to it that people are responsible.
On the other side of the spectrum, one turns into an unrecognizable individual who feels he should change everything the team has done and mark it as his own.
After all, the head is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often creates divisions between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are expected to meet the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are some subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as the contact point for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of a conventional team as their teams may meet according to varying time zones and this may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, page 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each of the members reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? One of the goals for realising the concepts of a learning organization in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used in an organization's functional departments, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the process of working together of an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets the needs of the client.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006), explains the Continuous Sequence approach as a method being used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data gives physical proof of the theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Therefore, this makes the field of research less vast and makes it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, traumas, lesions and tumours affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and processes of the mind that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand the processes in our mind.
Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) has a strong connotation of science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, and deals with intelligent behavior, learning and adaptation in a machine.
AI research involves creating machines that automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customers' diagnoses and questions, as well as the recognition of calligraphy, voice and face.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it has been built into various home computer software applications and videogames.
On-site trips are a big part of every class. Often, a teacher likes to take her students to places where there is no possibility to go by bus.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. Students can look at museum artefacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their classmates.
Sharing with others of a field trip virtually is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, each year the website is changed again, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. Although students often start their blog experience with poor grammar and spelling, having an audience generally causes this situation to change.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer begins to work to improve writing so that it is not criticized.
Also blogging "makes students learn more about the world around them." The need to satisfy the audience's interest inspires students to be more reachable and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students will be able to define their positions in the context of other people's writings and explain their perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the incandescent and bilingual capital of Canada and contains an array of art galleries and museums depicting Canada's past and present.
Further south is the Niagara Falls and further north is the untapped natural beauty of Moscow and beyond.
All these things and more emphasize Ontario as the perfect example of what is considered Canadian by foreigners.
Larger areas further north have a rather sparse population and some are areas in an almost uninhabited natural state.
For a population comparison that surprises many people: There are more African-Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent for it when we talk about wildlife.
Many of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and known as luxury resorts on beaches.
The Arabs also brought Islam into the lands, and this spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, as the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is surrounded by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman who is traveling say that she is married, whatever her current status regarding marriage.
It is also useful to wear a ring (just not one that seems to be expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they may view as harassment and it is not uncommon to be followed, kidnapped by the arm, etc.
Stand firm when rejecting men, and don't be afraid to insist on your preference (whether there are cultural differences or not, it doesn't mean you have to accept everything as right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids used it as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese broke it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but then abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan king rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and was given the name "Casablanca" by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to buy in all of Morocco.
Across the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery items, leather items, hookahs, and a full spectrum of geegaws, but all are touristic.
Goma is a tourist town of the Democratic Republic of Congo in the extreme east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by a lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that buried most of the city's streets, particularly the city center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside of Goma should be researched to know the fighting state that still persists in the northern Kivu province.
The city is also the base to acquaint with the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest trekking of the Mountain Gorilla in Africa.
You can use the bodabuda (taxi motor) to turn into Goma. The normal (local) price is <0x7E>500 Congolese francs for a short lap.
Along with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" was used as a metaphor for exotic and remote lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered world heritage sites, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during the PBS special series "Wonders of the African World" by Henry Louis Gates.
The city contrasts strongly with other cities of the country, because it has more Arab than African elements.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the Mozambique border in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park is spread over 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each containing different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the emblem of South African National Parks ("South African National Parks" - SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, daily fees are applied for conservation and entry into the park.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which provides income either for park selections in South Africa or for all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island ("Hong Kong Island") gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider to be the main focus.
The deployment of the Hong Kong skyscraper-forming building has been likened to a brightly lit bar chart due to the apparent presence of the waters of the Port of Victoria.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront on the other side.
Most of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is densely packed on reclaimed land along the north shore.
This is the place that the British colonists took as theirs and so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest littoral mangrove forest, 80 km (50 miles) long from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest in Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not just mangroves in wetlands — they include some of the last remaining positions of the imposing jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, about a third of which is covered by water/wet areas.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (during the river) during the day, though most of them, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang depart between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m.
Since buses between districts are often full, it is recommended that the ticket be purchased a few days in advance.
Many districts contain small Japanese Coaster Buses services, which are comfortable and sound.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cabled-held bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guyana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, it is 378 meters long and has two wide lanes 3.50 m.
The vertical gap under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs control points are expected to be completed.
Guaran<0xC3><0xAD> were the most significant indigenous group living in what is today Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region contained other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycur<0xC3><0xBA> and Payagu<0xC3><0xA1>, who survived by hunting, harvesting and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the meeting of Spanish conquistadors with native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the period of colonization which lasted three centuries.
Since the foundation of Asunci<0xC3><0xB3>n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo camps in Las Ca<0xC3><0xB1>itas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check out the Asociaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands pound (FKP) whose value is equivalent to that of the British pound (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands located in Stanley adjacent to FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted everywhere on the islands and in Stanley credit cards and U.S. dollars are also accepted frequently.
On the external islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although it may be that the British and US currencies are accepted; talk to the owners in advance to see what is an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to change the currency of the Falklands off the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, there is summer when in the Northern Hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is found in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above <0x2B>30<0xC2><0xB0>C are common.
Winter can be mischievously cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particular "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, wild animals still live wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, keep at least 100 yards/metre away from bears and wolfs and 25 yards/metre away from all other wildlife!
Independently of how docs, bison, elk, moose (large North American deer), bears, and almost all animals that are large can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not maintain the proper distance.These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
However, you should know that the smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking food with strong smells and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the mid-19th century and has been Samoa's official capital since 1959.
The port was the site of the infamous naval conflict in 1889 where seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except for one British crusader. Nearly 200 Americans and a German lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the murder of Chief Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many sandy beaches, because Auckland is located between two ports. The best known ones are located in three areas.
North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located in the Pacific Ocean and range from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy shores with safe swimming, and the majority have the shade provided by the pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located inside the Port of Waitemata, in the prestigious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Auckland Centre.
These are sandy beaches for the family that are sometimes crowded and have a good range of shops along the shore.
The main local beer is "Number One", it is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer called "Manta".
There are many French wines you can find, but the wines of New Zealand and Australia probably travel better.
Local tap water is good for drinking, but you can easily find bottled water if you have any concerns.
For Australians, the idea of a coffee called "flat white" is unfamiliar. "Short black" is "espresso", a capuchin comes full of lots of cream (not foamy), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is according to Belgian standards. Fruit juice is expensive but is excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place all year round, and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Still, you should seek advice from the authorities, follow all the signs, and be very careful about security messages.
The box-shaped bram ("box jellyfish") is found near beaches and near river estuaries from October to April in the north of 1770.
Although sharks exist, they seldom attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their primary habitat is in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
If they book in advance, the traveler will have a restful mind that he will have somewhere to sleep on arrival at his destination.
Travel agents often make deals with specific hotels, although you may find it possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping places, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages including breakfast, transport arrangements to/from the airport and even packages combining flight and hotel.
They may also keep the reservation for you if you need more time to think about the offer or to get other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any amendment or request shall be forwarded to the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of those who go to music festivals decide to camp on the spot, and most of them consider this to be an essential part of the experience.
If you want to see the action closely you must arrive early to have a camping site close to the music.
Keep in mind that although the music on the main stages may be over, there may be festival sections that keep playing music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you're going to cross the North Baltic in winter, check out the cabin's location, because when you pass through the ice it makes a horrible noise to those most affected.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempted from visa requirements (check terms).
Casinos typically make great efforts to maximise the time and money guests spend in it.There are generally no windows and clocks and it can be difficult to find exit locations.
They usually have special food, drink and entertainment offerings, to keep guests in a good mood, and to keep them on site.
Some places offer free alcoholic beverages. However, drunkenness hinders judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who will drive at high latitudes or cross mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On roads with snow and ice, there is not much friction and you can't drive as if you were on a bare asphalt.
During heavy snowstorms, in a short time enough snow can fall to make you stick.
Visibility may also be restricted by falling or flying snow or condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
The safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the main point of many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to land travel for the observation of African wild and fantastic animals, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars and close to standard equipment that allows good views.
Lions, cysts and leopards are sometimes overgrown and better seen with binoculars.
Walking safari (also called "walk in the "bush" ("bush walk")", "safari on hike ("hiking safari")", or "going "footing") consists of a hike, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralimpics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, since it already hosted the matches in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before announcing the postponement, you may have a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but from the end of March many of the coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics had been scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between <0xC2><0xA5>2,500 and <0xC2><0xA5>130,000, and typical tickets are around <0xC2><0xA5>7,000.
The ironing on damp clothes can help them dry out. Many hotels have ironing boards and a board to pass on available to use, even if you don't have one in the room.
If ironing iron is not available, or if you do not want to wear passed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which may cause it to sting, or in extreme cases, burn).
There are several ways to purify water, a few of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, in others it takes several minutes.
The filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, you should consider buying your water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter skeptical animals that they are not familiar with in the regions where they live.
Pests can ruin food, cause irritation, or in a worse case cause allergic reactions, give poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, generally do not qualify as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duty in certain places.
Travellers going to heavily taxed countries can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The road between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, as it often passes isolated backwoods wides.
If you are not used to driving in the countryside, be careful: there is a predominance of steep hills, narrow lanes and strong turning.
Maximum speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections — commonly 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — and their strict obedience is even more important than otherwise.
However, curiously, mobile service is much more powerful here than in many other parts of the route, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit cakes are common, and cooked apples are used in cakes all year round, and cherries and plums begin in summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and nuts of other trees. Known cakes often go well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try those that according to the region are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on spices, along with meat or vegetables.
The curry may be "dry" or "juicy" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and in some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Because there are 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is a general term covering the large variety of regional cooking found throughout the country.
But, if used without further qualifiers, the term tends to mean food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island Java.
Javanese cooking, now widely available in the archipelago, includes a range of plainly seasoned dishes, and Javanese's favorite predominant flavourings are peanuts, chilis, sugar (especially coconut sugar).
The staffs are a support for the rider's feet hanging on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but may have safety issues due to the potential for the rider's legs to stick to them.
If a rider falls off a horse but has a foot caught in the staff, he may be dragged if the horse escapes. To reduce this risk, a number of safety precautions may be taken.
First of all, many of the riders wear riding boots with a smooth and rather narrow heel and sole.
Subsequently, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow the staff's leather strip to be detached from the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
Cocham<0xC3><0xB3> Valley (Cocham<0xC3><0xB3> Valley) - Chile's main climbing destination, known as the South American Yosemite, with several large walls of granite and rock.
The highest points include spectacular views from the peaks. Barbers from all parts of the world are constantly establishing new routes amid its endless wall potential.
Ice sports for downhill, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports involving sliding downhill on an ice-covered floor on skis or an ice board attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many amateurs, sometimes known as "ski bums," planning full holidays around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old — cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Skiing for downhill as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first Norwegian recreational ski club was opened in Australia.
Backpacking with skiing: This activity is also called "backcountry ski", "ski touring" or "ski hiking".
It is related to, but generally does not involve, skiing touring or climbing the alpine-style mountains, where the latter takes place on steep terrain and requires much tougher skis and boots.
Consider the route of skiing as a similar route of hiking.
Under good conditions you will be able to cover distances slightly longer than walking – but it is only very rare that you will have the speeds of "cross country" skiing without a heavy backpack in prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. Normally, to travel from many countries you will have to go through visa applications and passport control several times.
The Schengen area, however, works somewhat like a single country in this regard.
As long as you remain in this area, you will generally be able to cross the borders without going through the checkpoints for passport verification again.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for each of the Schengen member countries separately, thus saving time, money and documentation.
There is no universal definition for which manufactured goods are antiques. Some tax agencies define goods that are over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Craft products can be defined as antiques, although they are more recent than similar items produced in mass.
Breeding reindeer is an important livelihood among S<0xC3><0xA1>mi and culture around trade is also important for many people who have other professions.
Even traditionally, despite this, not all S<0xC3><0xA1>mi were involved in large-scale rearing of reindeer, but lived from fishing, hunting and the like, and had reindeer mostly as animals to draw heavy weights.
Today many S<0xC3><0xA1>mi work in modern trades. Tourism is an important income in S<0xC3><0xA1>pmi, the S<0xC3><0xA1>mi area.
Although it is used extensively, especially among non-Romans, the word "Gipsis" is often considered offensive because of its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions about the Romanian people.
If the country you are visiting becomes subject to a travel notice, your travel health insurance or cancellation insurance for your trip may be affected.
You can also consider consulting the advice of other governments and not your own, but their advice is tailored to their citizens.
As one example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
An advisory report is a summary of the political situation in one country.
The views presented are often quick, general and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause harm, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of weather, which can depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, ice, excessive rainfall, and fires in uncultivated areas are types and effects of severe weather, such as thunderstorms, air rumbles, sea rumbles, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include strong ice storms, snowbursts, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather that may affect their area as it may affect their travel plans.
Anyone who organises a visit within a country that can be considered a war zone must carry out professional training.
A search on the Internet for a "hostile environment course" will probably upload a local company's address.
A course usually covers all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course is usually from 2-5 days and involves a role play, much first aid training and sometimes weapons-use training.
Books and magazines on survival in the wild are common, but there are not many publications on war zones.
Travellers planning a surgical operation for sexual reassignment abroad must ensure they are carrying the valid documents for the return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with the undeclared gender (X) or updated documents to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honour these documents varies equally widely.
Searches at security checkpoints also became much more intrusive in the post-11 September 2001 era.
Pre-operational transgender people should not expect to pass through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Split currents ("ripp currents") are the flow that returns from waves that are cut off from the bay, often in a reef or similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and can form a fast current to the deep water there.
Many deaths occur due to fatigue after trying to swim back against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as it comes out of the current, it will not be more difficult than usual to swim back.
Try to aim somewhere where you won't get caught again or, depending on your skills and if you've been noticed, you may prefer to wait for the rescue.
The shock of re-entry comes before the shock of culture (there is a shorter phase of the honey moon), lasts longer, and may be more intense.
Travelers who have found it easy to adjust to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to re-adjust to their native culture.
When you return to your home country after you have lived abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and have lost some of your country's culture habits.
When you switched, people probably at first took patience and understood you, knowing that travelers in a new country will need to adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also required for travelers to return home.
The sound and light display of the pyramid is one of the most interesting things on the children's side.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
You usually hear the sound of tourists and sellers. The story of the sound and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is used as the background and narrator of a long history.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are lit.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by many nations and have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the Peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the colonization of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the Peninsula, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The Peninsula's mountains here merge into the plain, then re-emerge to form the 360 km Ellsworth Mountain chain, scattered into two of the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinella Range has the highest Antarctic mountain, the Vinson Massif, with a peak reaching 4892 m at Mount Vinson.
In remote locations, without mobile phone coverage, the satellite phone may be your only choice.
A satellite phone generally does not replace a mobile phone, as it must be outdoors with a clear satellite view to make a call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that need to communicate remotely by voice and data.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information on how to connect to this service.
An option that is becoming more popular among those planning a year of study break is to travel and learn.
This is particularly popular with school dropouts, allowing them to take a year before entering university, without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course during an interval year abroad can actually improve your chances of progressing to higher education back in your country.
Typically there will be a tuition fee for enrolling in these educational programs.
Finland is a very good destination for shipping. The "Land of a thousand lakes" (Land with a thousand lakes) also has thousands of islands, in lakes and coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and lakes you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kajak offer a different experience.
Shipping is a national hobby in Finland, where there is a boat for every seven or eight people.
This also applies to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Many of the most distinguished cruises in the Baltic include an extended visit to St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for about two full days while returning at night and sleeping on the ship.
If you leave on land only using on-board excursions you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises show Berlin, Germany in the brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not by the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, particularly if you have never flown before or experienced a traumatic event.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's no different from the personal fears and aversions that many people have for other things.
For some, understanding a little about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help them overcome a fear that is based on what they don't know or on things they don't have control over.
Corridor companies are well paid for delivering things quickly. Often, time is very important in the case of commercial documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, large companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies there was a problem.
If you have shipped goods by air, it may have taken days for some routes to clear and customs.
The only way to get through it faster was to send it as checked baggage.Airlines regulations do not allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and here's where you come in.
The obvious way of flying in the first class or business class is to come up with a thick bunch of money for the privilege (or, so much better, hire your company to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as approximate rules, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economic fare for business (business class), and eleven times more for first class (first class)!
Generally, it doesn't make sense to look for discounts for seats in the business class and those in the first class on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain important group of air travellers who are willing to pay the highest prices for the privilege of arriving somewhere quickly and comfortably, and charging for these things.
The capital of Moldova is Chi<0xC5><0x9F>in<0xC4><0x83>u. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by any UN member country.
Economic ties were re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
Formerly the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed and vibrant business centre, built around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass-faced buildings and modern shopping malls are stained with traditional red tile roofs, the 18th century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has a more Mediterranean European atmosphere than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvik offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, one finds interesting marble sculptures of pigeons on certain graves.
Don't be sorry if you spend half an hour walking around the intriguing village.
To the north and easily reached is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra which became known to foreigners after the description full of praise for its great beauty expressed by Lord Byron.
Scotturb Bus 403 regularly travels to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
In addition, in the north visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (Capella), the place of the world-renowned Marian apparitions.
Please remember that, in essence, you are visiting a site of mass graves, as well as a site that has an almost incalculable meaning for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women still alive today who have managed to survive through the time they have spent here, and many more who have had their loved ones killed or put to death there, Jews as well as non-Jews.
Please treat the site with the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not make vandalism on the spot by marking or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Roughly half of the people prefer to speak Catalan, most of the people understand it, and almost everyone practically speaks Spanish.
However, most signs are marked only in Catalan because it is established by law as the first official language.
But, Spanish is also used extensively in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the Metro are made in Catalan only, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being selfish, cold and arrogant.
While this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to cope in Paris is still to behave properly, acting like someone who is an "élevé door" (well raised). This helps considerably to cope more easily.
The unfriendly attitudes of the Parisians are quickly eroded when you show them basic courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes natural park is covered with many trees, mainly beech, spruce and pine trees, and contains a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities, due to its range of microclimate, different soils and different altitude levels.
The area also hosts an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and wild lobster can be found there, along with many more common species
While visiting monasteries, women will have to wear skirts that cover their knees and have their shoulders covered as well.
Most of the monasteries provide a scarf for women who are not prepared, but if you bring yours, especially one with bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or the nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear trousers that cover the knees.
This can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance but those clothes are not washed after every person who wears them so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
Majorca cooking, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in every dish.
A popular and simple dish, especially in summer, is the Oli Pa amb: Bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and condiments that are available such as cheese, oil tuna, etc.
All nouns, next to the word Sie for you, always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of the sentence.
This is an important method of distinguishing between verbs and objects.
Certainly, this facilitates reading, although writing is a little complicated due to the need to find out if a verb or adjective is used in a substantive form.
Pronunciation in Italian is relatively easy because many words are pronounced exactly as they are written
The main letters you must look out for are "c" and "g", because their pronunciation varies depending on which vowel comes after them.
Besides, make sure you pronounce r and rr different: caro means expensive, while carro means trailer.
The Persian language has relatively easy grammar and, in most part, regular.
Therefore, reading this introductory textbook of grammar can help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand the phrases.
Of course, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it does not need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete nowadays, and remain as museums, or educational places.
Since light pollution at its best has not been the kind of problem we currently have, they are generally found in cities or campuses, and it is easier to reach them than those built in modern times.
Many modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The cherry blossom display, known as "hanami", has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the chosen flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivities were hosted by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy only around the Imperial Court.
Plants appear at their best when they are in a natural environment, therefore, resist the temptation to remove even a "only one" sample.
If you visit a formally organised garden, the collection of "samples" will also lead to you being expelled, without discussions.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to be in and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything after you arrive.
But when placed in the "high tropics" only a few degrees north of the equator you will need to face both (always) heat and strong sun (when the sky is clear, more rarely).
There are also a few buses going north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check that the bus you are planning to catch goes to Hebron and not just to the Jewish settlement near Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme to base a holiday around.
For example visits to castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine valley or cruises to interesting towns on the Danube or boat tours along the Erie Canal.
They also define popular lane routes for long walks and wheel driving.
Christmas is one of the most important festivals of Christianity, and is celebrated as Jesus' birthday.
Many of the traditions associated with the feast have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
There is a tradition that passes on the eve of Easter awakened in an exposed place to see the sunrise.
Of course there are theological explanations for this tradition, but it can also be a spring ritual and pre-Christian fertility.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday evenings during Easter weekends, and congregations often begin celebrations at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by blinding, flying or floating here.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals were unable to make the journey and so the giant tortoise became the main grazing animal inside the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, several mammals including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats and dogs have been introduced.
If you go to the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter you experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Aurora borealis, as the sky will be more or less dark all the time.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution therefore often does not cause problems, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
The Japanese working culture is more hierarchical and formal than that which Westerners are accustomed to.
Suits are standard work clothes, and colleagues call each other by surname or work titles.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, with emphasis placed on the group's effort and not on encouraging individual achievements.
Workers often need to obtain the approval of their superiors for any decision they make, and are expected to obey the instructions of their superiors without reservations.
