There's a lot of medium-cat animal under them, mostly bunny, squirrel and deer hunters.
A lot of small cats (ÂÅ∂n-dollar cats) are also hunting for many small preys, including insects, teeth-like animals, lizards and birds.
The secret of success is in Liki's view that every cat's work is unique, so they won't compete with each other.
The lions are the most populous cats, living in a big group called lions.
There are one to three adult lions in the lions, together with 30 female lions and young lions.
Female lions are usually sisters and daughters of the same family.
The Lions' behavior is very similar to the wolves or dogs, which are unfortunately similar to the lions (but not the other large cats), and they are very thick for their prey.
The tiger is a full-scale sport, able to climb (although not very skilled), swimming, long distance jumping and having more than five times the power of a strong human.
The tigers and lions, the leopards and the panthers belong to the same kind.
The tiger's noise doesn't sound like a lion, but it's like a mess, screaming.
The panther cats like small animals, they hunt monkeys, snakes and snakes, and teeth, and they hunt birds.
Scientists think that the panthercats are tracking and hunting by scenting and finding prey.
They have good night visions at night, and they can move quietly and quietly.
When a small group of creatures (a small group) separate from their main communities (e.g. crossing the mountains or rivers, or moving to the islands so that they can't easily return, they usually find the environment different from the past.
The new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population needs different features or changes to be more competitive than the past.
The original population has not changed, so it still needs to be the same function as the previous.
As time passes, the newborn population begins to adapt to the new environment, and their appearances are more different from others.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, these two groups will look very different, so they can't be called the same species.
The process is called genetic, and it means that the seeding of new species is a result that cannot be avoided in the process of evolution.
Plant produces oxygen intake by humans and absorbs carbon dioxide from humans.
Plants can also provide cover at the same time as plants.
We built the house with plants, made clothes, and most of the food we eat was planted, and animals would not survive without plants.
Dragon was the top predator of that time, so they were not afraid of any creature except the rest of the dragon.
It's full of 70 more teeth like razor blade, plus another tooth ripped up, which means that no creature can escape in his eyes.
We can't be sure, but we think he might have a double tongue, and he'll eat turtles, large fish, other dragon dinosaurs, or even the same.
He will attack anything in the water; even the giant dinosaurs like the Dragon are not his opponents.
Although the food of the Romans is not strange to us, they do eat some strange or rare food, like wild pigs, powders, cows, and a brothel animal called squirrel.

Although no one knows who wrote this text, it is certain that this huge file of goat papers (with a wide range of 293‚ÅÑ4 inches by 241‚ÅÑ2 inches) is a collection early.
So it's likely that we're going to add this to the sign.
Norman Demotix and his subsequent battles have allowed the north of France to be free, but the south has not been liberated.
These Frenchmen were ruled by Vichy in France in 1940 with the Germans, and working with the aggressors rather than against them.
On August 15th, 1940, the Allies attacked the southern part of France, called the Dragon Knight.
In a short two weeks, the United States and the Free French Army liberated South Law and turned to Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a group of people living and working in a way that is evident and shared by society.
The word "civilis" comes from Latin "civilis" which means "civis" in Latin, and "civitas" in Latin, meaning "civis" and "civitas," which also defines social patterns in some way.
The state of the city is the predecessor of the country, and civilization is meant to inherit the knowledge of many generations, the prolonged cultural legends and the spread of the world.
A small culture often disappears without historical marks and cannot be identified as a legitimate civilization.
During the Independence War, the Thirteen states first established a fragile central government (which is the only institution) according to the Confederation Law.
The government does not have the power to collect taxes, and because of the absence of the National Administration or the Ministry of Justice, it is necessary to rely on State authorities that are often incompatible with the law.
It has no right to revoke tax laws and customs between the state and the state.
These laws require the full agreement of all states to be amended, while the state's attitudes towards the central government are very prevalent and often deficit.

Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of them is the state), making Japan the world's 7th Great Island!
As a result of Japan ' s grouping of islands, with geology perspectives, Japan is often classified as a group of islands.
The history starts in Taiwan to the 15th century, when the European sailors recorded the island's name as Holmesa, meaning a beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch Indian company established a base in south-west of Taiwan, opened the transformation of indigenous crop production methods and hired Chinese workers to work in rice and sugarcane fields in the company.
In 1683, the Government controlled the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan by force, and declared Taiwan a province of Chiangang in 1885.
In 1895, the Government signed the "Concords" after the defeat of the Dawn War (1894-1895), choosing the main rights of Taiwan to Japan.
Marcus is formed by three main structures, separate from the sunset, the sunhouse and the temple.

For example, the world's most common static image format is 35 metres, which are the main sizes of the sphere of the end of the timing.
It's still producing to date, but more importantly, the digital sensing components have been using their length.
Actually, that 35 metric format was some confusing, 36 metres wide, 24 metres high.
The length of this format is called 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS to enter the camera system format) are equally equally or close to this length.
The three-thirds of smuggling and laughing are simple directives, while creatively creative and well-ordered.
It pointed out that after the vertical and horizontal levels, the line points were the most effective place to film the subject (see example).
In this period of Europe's history, wealthy and powerful Catholic Church has been subjected to strict review.
In a thousand years, even though language and customary differences persist, Christianity has been linked to European countries.
Its inexperience affects everyone, the king, the civilian.
Christianity has a major message that wealth must be used to help the poor and that the capital of the church is specifically created for that reason.
For a thousand years, the church's core has been in Rome, and this power is concentrated with money, and many people question whether the Church is indeed following this letter.
Soon after the war broke out, the United Kingdom started to launch a sea blockade against Germany.
The tactics that cut the necessary military and civilian biomass supply are effective, although such blockades have violated the international law that has been developed through a number of international agreements and generally accepted by all countries in the past two centuries.
The United Kingdom has placed water mines in international waters to prevent any ship from entering the entire sea or even threatening the neutral ship.
As a result of the lack of responses to this tactic, Germany believes that their unrestricted submarine fights will not exert force.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of many citizens and nations was peaceful and isolated.
After witnessing the fear and atrocities of the first world war, all countries want to avoid the future of this situation.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and accepted Edison's job in New York City.
He had four scores, a poem and Charles Bachler, who wrote to Thomas Edison a recommendation for him to come to America.
The ancient Chinese use a unique way to express different times; the various stages of China ' s or the families in power belong to a very different kingdom.
The most famous of them is the 60-year-old era between Han Ching and Zhou.
During these periods, many of the nobles have fought a violent war for the sake of the kingdom.
Three countries are one of the bloody times in the ancient history of China, and thousands of people have lost their lives to take up the throne of the Royal House of West Ammon.
The Revolution has led to a number of social and political impacts, such as the use of public regimes, the transformation of dictatorialism into communism and nationalism, and the belief that the State belongs to the people rather than to the monarchy.
In the aftermath of the revolution, all jobs are open to all males who do so, allowing the most willing and successful to take over.
The same situation has happened in the army, because they have not been in the ranks of military divisions, but they have done the same.
The French Revolution has also inspired the forced labour class to launch the revolution in many other countries.
Mohammad was deeply interested in what happened to the world, and he used to go to a hole called "Hira" on the hill.
The cave itself has been reversed in times of time, and the spirit of the born Mohamed.
This mountain hole is on the top of a mountain in the north of Mexico, completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, it's not easy to find even if someone knows it exists.
In addition to the beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains above, nothing can be seen; in the caves there is only one small part of the world.
The Giza pyramid is the only seven miracles in the world that is still in place today.
The big pyramid was built by Egyptians in the first three centuries of the year, one of the major pyramid buildings of the late Pharaohs.
A few pyramids (the big pyramids are the largest pyramid in the world), a few small tombs, a few temples and a huge lion face.
The big pyramid was built for the honor of ancient Pharaoh, while many smaller pyramids were built in the tombs and temples to honor the wives and family members.

If you want to know the Knights, you must understand the circumstance that has led to the creation of this organization.
Ultimately, these events are known as the period of China, the 11, 12 and the 13th century of Europe's history (1000 to 1300 years).
In the middle of the Middle Century, the mid-century, after the end of the century, traditionally believed that the end of the century was about 1500 years.
The sciences decided that this vocabulary covers a number of tactical concepts, which have been driven from techniques or technology-oriented changes, to the relatively rigorous "science of science and science's manifestations in science" that would push human fate.
There are two main concepts for the release of science and technology: technology itself‚Äôs development path is far more powerful than cultural or political factors, and technology is going to "have" society inherently, rather than socially.
For example, people say cars are going to push the roads.
However, in order to create a national road network for a small number of cars is not inconsistent with the economy, people develop new methodologies to reduce the cost of holding cars.
The increase in the number of people with cars will increase the chances of road accidents, and the development of human beings in new medical techniques for the rehabilitation of wounded organisms.
Culture decisions are one of the important structures of romanticism, and many of the authors of song, Fischt and Schleiger.
In romantic circulars, the geographic environment shapes a body and creates customs and cultures that are associated with the geographic environment in time.
As Paris was honored as a modern world, Constantinople was also honored as a time to block Europe.
It's the name of the luxury centre, which starts about 400 years in Wisconsin, and it lasts for about 1100 years.
Its status is sloppy in the 12th century, mainly because the crusades have returned home with silk and spices, and these presents are worth more than those selling in Bai.
At that time, the head of fashion moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gordon style has reached the peak in the 10th to 11th and 14th centuries.
At first, it was influenced by the culture of Oriental Bay.
However, because of the slowness of communication channels, western styles may fall back to 25 to 30 years.
In the end of the mid-century, Western Europe started to develop a unique style.
Self-sufficiency farming is an agricultural type that is sufficient enough for farmers and their families.
Self-sufficiency farming is a simple agricultural system that usually operates organic farming, retains and uses seeds of raw crops in local ecological areas, uses rounds or other relatively simple technologies to increase production.
Historically, most of the farmers have become self-sufficiency farmers, and many developing countries are still doing so.
The subculture is similar to that of people who feel neglected by society in order to develop a sense of identity.
The subculture is unique because of the ages of members, races, classes, geographic location or sexuality.
The characteristics that make the sub-culture valid may be linguistic, artificial, political, sexual, geographic or all kinds of factors.
The subcultural members usually recognize their belongings through special and symbolic forms, including dressing, act-off and the use of synonym.
One of the methods used to describe the importance of socialization is the unfortunate case of children being neglected during their growth, erroneous or deliberate abuse and the lack of access to adults to socialization.
In some cases, children are abandoned because their parents do not accept the child ' s intellectual or physical deficiency.
In the past, children may experience severe ill-treatment or trauma before they are abandoned or fled.
Other children are said to be raised by animals; some are said to live alone in the wild.
If wild children grow up entirely by non-human animals, they show almost the same behaviour as caring for their animals (with the physics permission), such as fear or indifference to human beings.
It's more fun to learn in a project-based way, and it's more fun to learn, and it's more upstairs.
Eagle Scheme is not a learning method, but is an aid that supports people who have access to new learning experiences (e.g. using new computers or starting new projects).
The eagle is virtual and practical, and in other words, the teachers and the Microsoft Office's twisted tattoos are a kind of eagle shelf.
The virtual eagle has been built in the software, which is designed to ask questions, tips and descriptions of procedures that students may be unable to handle alone.
There are many reasons why children are sent to foster care centres, including neglect, ill-treatment or even extortion.
No child should be raised in a lack of nutrition, care and education, but this is not the case.
We think the foster system is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, full of caregivers, stable education and reliable medical care.
The foster families should provide all the necessities they were lacking in their previous families.
The Internet is aligned with both elements of the public and human connections.
From using and satisfying pathways, the explicit characteristics of the internet have opened the new border.
For example, learning and socialization are important motivations for the use of online networks (James, etc., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) found that when investigating the reactions to the website, "persons participate in" and "sexual relationships" are also a new motivational level.
The recordings have brought significant discoveries for reading the micrometeorology and maintaining a few mm in the face.
Particularly, it was thought that it would be possible to detect if a person was lying.
Oliver Saxx, in his post "President ' s speech," said that people who cannot understand the content of the speech because of the loss of their brains are still able to sense the honesty of the lecturers.
He even thinks that animals, such as dogs, may have the ability to explain human behavior.
Studies in the twentieth century show two genetic mutations: invisible and obvious.
The change increases the genetic mutation, and the choice of the day will remove it from the visible mutations.
Every generation, segregation and reorganization will make both obvious and hidden genes different.
Destroying a human-like vegetation system does not take enough hydrogen acid from plants on the grasslands.
In addition, the insufficient mining of acid leads to serious consequences: poor growth and poor nutrition, ultimately death.
The most convenient vegetable resources are protein available in leaves and potatoes, but they are hard to quench for vegetable animals like us.
Relatively, animal food (ant, white ants, eggs) is not only easy to digest but also to provide expensive proteins containing the necessary hydrocarbon acid.
After considering all the factors, we don't have to be surprised if our ancestors deal with the protein problem, like the chimps on the current reckoning.
Sleep breaks mean to wake up in a general sleep period and to sleep in a short period (10-60 minutes).
By using a relatively quiet alarm, your consciousness will be completely awake.
If you find yourself going to start a alarm in your sleep, you can put the alarm on the other side of the room and force yourself to get off the alarm.
Other options based on the physiological anniversary include a large amount of liquids (especially water or tea, a recognized urine) before sleep, which has to get up and urine.
The level of calm within a person is in contrast to the level of nervousness of one person.
The more you relax, the stronger you have, the stronger you have, the potential for every one of you to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
The only obstacle on the way of understanding is our own anxiety and negative energy.
Buddhism is based on the doctrine of Buddhism, but by the way of Buddhism and the many skills of Indian yoga, the Buddhism can be spreading.
The Buddhist Church is very simple, including Luddari Yoga, philosophy and humbly educated people.
In doing Quentinian yoga, Quentinian energy is waking up through yoga, respiratory movement, Mantro prayer and visualization.
Buddhism is at the core of the idea of yoga... to see God, to purify all energy channels, to start the tunnel, to create a sense of understanding.
Germany is a common enemy during the Second War to promote cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States.

On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense line was out of control, and the only hope was to withdraw and rebuild at the Romani bridge.
However, these plans have been eradicated over one night by over 800,000 Soviet Red Armys violating riga and contracts, "POSU's non-compliance" and other side-to-side international agreements to invade Polish the eastern Polish, and then enters Belarus and Ukraine, forming the line of war between Russia and Ukraine.
The shipping of goods is the most efficient way to move a large number of people and goods over the sea.
Traditionally, the Navy's mission is to ensure that the country moves people and goods safely, while at the same time interfering with the operation of the enemy transferees and goods.
One of the most noteworthy examples in recent times is the North Atlantic war in the Second World War.
At the same time, the German naval forces are trying to block the transport (mainly using U submarines).
If the allies defeat, Germany might conquer England like the rest of Europe.
The goat seems to have been rehabilitated for the first time in the Iranian Zagros hills about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes start feeding them so they can get milk, hair, meat and skin.
The goats usually feed the hills or other pastoral areas, usually with the care of children or young goats, and the likelihood of a well-known shepherd. These pastoral methods are still being used to date.
England built Mala's tracks in the 16th century.
While the four cargo tracks were only made by parallel woodboards, horses were able to trail goods on the tracks, compared to a little skull road, transporting faster and carrying more cargo.
It's a long time ago, using the pillows to keep the tracks fixed.
This is a common practice, but the iron will cause more damage to the carriage.
Finally, the cyclone replaced the train in 1767, the first full iron railway.
The first people knew the fate was to walk along with Homo Erectus (i.e., straight) and the human race began to walk straight two million years ago.
Their predecessors don't go straight to the South Apes.
In 420 to 390,000 years ago, a twin movement was found, even though the Chadian apes could have been used for 72 million years ago.
We can start a more friendly life for the environment, and we can be environmentally active, even socially, to minimize the suffering of the future.
But if we want more than temporary solutions, then we should find the root causes of the problem and solve them thoroughly.
The world has changed because of the progress of human science and technology, and because of the surplus of the population and the waste of human life, the problem has been exacerbated.
After the adoption of Parliament on 4 July, a draft signed by the President of Parliament, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson, were sent to several blocks outside John Dunlap.
It's been printed all night, 150 to 200, and now it's called "a single printer."
The paper was read by John Nixon on July 8th in the courtroom of the Independence Chamber for the first time.
One of them was sent to George Washington on 6 July, George Washington on 9 July to his team in New York.
The 25 printed copies of the Repub album still existed as the oldest version in this document, the original handwriting did not remain.
Now, many ancient biologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived to the present day, that is what we call birds.
Because they grow feathers and can fly, and many people don't think they're kind of a dinosaur.
But birds and dinosaurs still have a lot of similarities.
They've got shars and claws on their feet, they'll lose eggs, and they'll walk with two back legs like a dragon.
In fact, all computers are now based on the message set up in the second-in-the-dimensional encoding.
The binary number has only 0 or one or two values, and these numbers are called binary digits, or the digits called in computer techniques.
Medicine in the body may not appear immediately.
It would be better to judge the signs of poison in the body, which could be found with a container of open drugs or toxic household chemicals.
To see the emergency help on the tag of the particular poison.
The word "bugs" is the official name of insects for these kinds of insects.
This name is derived from the ancient knowledge of bugs, which are highly appropriate for human insects.
Hunting and bedbears are characterized in the nests to live in nests or in the homes of their hosts.
In the United States, about 400,000 cases of known multiple stereotyped stereotypes have become the main neurosurgeon for younger and middle-age adults.

The main goal of science is to understand the way the world works through science.
However, the experiment is not the only one, and the experiment is to eliminate one or more hypothetical tests, and questions and observations can lead scientific research.
Astronomers and philosophers focus on the script, especially the Latin Bible.
All the scientific points of Aristotle, including psychology, are accepted.
The Western world has broken its roots with Greek philosophy and science.
Many scholars have observed the physics and customs on the grounds, usually depending on the biologically inherent weekly, and on the quality of the physiological clock.
It's not just the weekly holidays that respond to the weeklines in the outside world that can be observed on most of the creatures like bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
The physiological clock is a self-sustained surgery, even without external signals, and the weekly anniversary of the autonomous operation.
Hezekiah-Chee's experiment is one of the main experiments that show DNA for genetics.
Hershey and Chase use the vegetation of bacteria, or call the virus to transplant their DNA into bacteria.
They carried out two experiments, one of DNA in the body using radiophosphosphate marks, and another of protein that uses radioactive sulphur marks to feed the body.
According to the varied species, the importance of affected genetics and whether the affected cells are genital cells can have different effects.
Only a reproductive cell changes are given to children, while other places can result in the death or cancer of cells.
A naturally subjected travel process attracts people who are interested in nature to enjoy natural viewing, including wildlife.
For example, the current event includes hunting, fishing, photography, tourists, and information about visiting parks and researching habitat systems.
For example, visiting Grandma, photographing and understanding red gorillas.
Every morning, a group of people drove out of town to work in the countryside, rubbing out with another group of people, and their place of departure was the destination of another group of people's jobs.
In this busy traffic trip, everyone has a certain degree of linkage with this private car-based transport system and supports its existence.
Now, scientists point out that this large array of carbon economic activity has left the biosphere out of the last two million years to support the steady state of human activity.
Everybody is involved in social activities, using the transport system, almost everyone complains about the transport system.
In developing countries, you're very rare to hear similar complaints about water quality and the bridges.
Why do the transport systems make these complaints a problem every day because of the insufficient capacity of traffic engineers or the more fundamental causes?
Traffic flows are a study of the movement of different drivers and vehicles, as well as interactive relationships between roads.
The question is, because 100 per cent of the presumption of driving habits is very difficult to study traffic flows.
Fortunately, the driver's course is towards reasonable convergence, and therefore the traffic has reasonable consistency and the mathematical approach is slightly manifested.
In order to give a better expression of traffic flows, we define the relationship between three main features: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships are useful for transport designs, design and operation.
Insects are the first animals flying in the air... their flying ability makes it easier to hide from the enemy and to find food and spouses more efficiently.
Most of the insects have the advantages of placing their wings along their body.
This has made them more intrigued places to avoid predators.

People knew gold, silver, copper, and basic chemical elements, because they existed in the natural world and used the original tools to be simple.
The philosopher Aristotle, all of which are built by one or more of four elements, such as earth, water, air and fire.
It's more like four states of substances (on the same order): solids, liquids, gases and ionumes, even though he argues that they will become new objects to form what we see.
It's basically two or more metal mixtures.
The elements like monkeys are regarded as metals, of course, and metals like silver and gold.
It also contains a small amount of non-metallic elements (e.g. carbon).
Everything in the universe is made up of substances, and all the substances are made by small particles called atomics.
Atomics are incredibly tiny, and the numerical atoms are enough to penetrate the end of this sentence.
So the pencil became a lot of good friends when he asked the world.
Unfortunately, the status and use of pencils is declining in the way of new writing.
Everyone's writing messages on the computer screen now and no more pencils.
We can only wonder where the keyboard will go until there's a new invention.
The operation of nuclear fissile bombs is based on the integration of multiple substances and mediums into an atomic nuclear necessity.
It's kind of like pushing heavy cars into the hills.
Some atoms are not stable at the core, which means that they are easily divided in the absence or very little push.
The surface of the moon is called the top floor of the Moon.
The shells are about 70 kilometres close, about 100 kilometres long away.
It's weaker under the moon. It's thicker at the top.
Maybe there's more moons and seas at close ends because the shells are weaker.
The core of the content theory is to find out what makes them motivating or attracting them.
These theory thinks that people have some needs or desires, and they have been transformed in the process of adulthood.
These theorys are what makes some people want something and what they want or don't do in their environment.
Maslo's demand-level theory and Hezberg's twin gene theory are both the content and theory.
Usually, when the manager starts leading the same day, two actions are possible. One of them is trying to keep himself in the same circle.
Such managers are difficult to make unwanted decisions, disciplinary distribution, performance evaluation, assignment of responsibility and responsibility.
He or she thinks he has to change all the practices that the team has always been doing and act in his own way.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the failure of the team.
This is often the result of a disagreement between the leaders and other members of the team.
The virtual team must comply with the quality standards of the traditional team, but there is a slight difference.
Virtual team members are usually the contact points of the industries that are directly collaborated.
They usually have more autonomy than traditional group members, and because their teams may meet in different time zones, they may not understand that.
With the name Larson and LaFasto, 1989, page 109, is a unique element of a virtual team.
Invisible teams are a management team, each member belongs directly to the team, and the team sets the standards for each member.
Why do organizations want to build a learning organisation in a time-consuming process? One of the objectives of putting the concepts of the organization into practice is to create a new one.
When all functional departments within the organization make effective use of all available resources, creativity and self-sustainment.
As a result, the constituent effort to overcome the barrier can lead to a new process to meet the client's needs.
Before organizing a new creative capacity, the leader should create a new culture, knowledge-sharing and organisation.
Angel (2006) describes continuity patterns as a way of helping organizations to reach higher levels of achievement.
The neurophysics data provide a solid proof of the theory of knowledge of research, so that the scope of the study is narrowed and more precise.
The link between psychology and behaviour in the brain supports research by scientists.
For a long time, people have always known that different types of brain damage, trauma, disease and tumors can affect behavior, and that some psychological changes have been made.
The invention of the new technology allows us to look into and study the unprecedented brain structure and the process.
This provides a lot of information and material for our simulation models that can help to understand the process of our mentality.
Although artificial wisdom has a strong component of the scientific imagination, artificial intelligence still has a very important branch of computer science to deal with the behaviour of machines, study and wisdom.
One of the content of artificial intelligence research is the creation of machines that can be automated to carry out the mission with wisdom.
Examples include controls, plans and schedules, the ability to answer customers ' diagnosis and problems, and the identification of handwriting, voice and face.
These things have become different sciences, the focus of which is to find a solution to the problems of real life.

The blog also helps to improve the student ' s ability to write. Although students often start their blogs with the grammatical law and spells, it is generally possible to change that because of the presence of the readers.
Since students are usually the most popular readers, bloggers will begin to work hard to strengthen their writing to avoid criticism.
The blog also wrote, "Let the students know more about the world around us". Toto, 2004, inspiring students to become more smart for their interests.
Bloggers are a tool to inspire cooperation to encourage students to extend learning far beyond traditional school life.
The correct use of blogs can strengthen students ' ability to analyse and critically; students can be able to rebuild the Internet materials and make sure where they are in the context of the articles written by others, and that they can squeeze their views on specific issues (Olavis, 2002).
Ottawa is the capital of Canada, the beautiful people in the environment, the two languages in English, with a lot of gallery and museums showing Canada's current style.
