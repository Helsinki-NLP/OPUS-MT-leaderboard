They did it through a micro-ray particle called "The Light".
Scientists call this process a radical radiation, because atoms are stimulating, leading to light in the light, and light is a type of radiation.
The next picture shows the atomic rays... in fact, it's a lot smaller than the ones you see in this picture.
The lights are even smaller than the atoms!
