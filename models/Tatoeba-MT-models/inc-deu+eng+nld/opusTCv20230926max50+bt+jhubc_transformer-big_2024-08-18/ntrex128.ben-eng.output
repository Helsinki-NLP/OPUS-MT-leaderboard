Welsh Assembly members worry about wearing themselves as ‘mapets’
Several members of the Assembly have expressed concern over the change in their designation to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
Due to this fear, the name of the Assembly has been proposed to be changed to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of various political parties fear that the name change will come to the fore in the face of ridicule.
A Labour party assembly member said his party was worried that the new designation "matched the rhythm with the twp and pwp."
For readers outside of Welsh: in Welsh, Twp means stupid and Pwp means mall.
A Pleading Assembly member said they were "not happy" as a team and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said the party was "open-minded" about the name change, but noted that the pronunciation difference between the MWP and the maizet was slight.
In this sense, the pronunciation of the Wesh letter W is similar to the pronunciation of the U letter in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing legislation to initiate the name change process, said: “The final decision on what will be the designation details of the Assembly members must be taken by the members themselves.”
The Government of Wales Act, 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the commission published the results of a referendum in which it received overwhelming support for a proposal to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Regarding the designation of Assembly members, the Commission is supporting the Welsh Parliament Member or WMP, but the MWP has the most support in the public opinion.
Apparently, the Assembly members are suggesting different options, but it will be difficult for the presiding officer, Elin Jones, to reach a consensus, to submit the draft of the legislation within a few weeks.
This provision of reform will include changes in the functioning of the Assembly, including the disqualification of the members of the Assembly and the design of the committee system.
After the debate over this provision, the members of the Assembly will have the opportunity to vote on what their designation should be.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to decide whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was made to avoid a decades-long conflict with neighboring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that its northern neighbor's name symbolizes the establishment of claims over its territory and has repeatedly objected to the country's application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, G<0xC3><0xA9>r<0xC3><0xA9>z Ivanov, who is opposed to a referendum on the name change, said he would reject the referendum.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Joran Zaev, feel that the change of name is only a step needed to join the European Union and NATO.
St. Martin's fruit hour is silent as the churches of Harlem are washed away
"The older people I spoke to said that historically there was one church and a bar in every corner," Mr Adams said.
"There's nothing today."
He said it was clear that the building had been demolished.
Nowadays, social media is used in different ways.
"The toilets are no longer the living room of the area where everyone goes on a regular basis."
In the case of the church, he is worried that the money sold out of the property will not last as long as the leaders think, “And be it today or tomorrow, going back to where they started.”
He added that apartment buildings and condominiums could be built in the place of the church where people would live who would not help the rest of the churches in the area.
“Most of the people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and so they will accelerate the day these churches are closed because most of the people who live in these condominiums are less likely to become church members.”
Before Harlem became a black-dominated city, both churches were founded by the White Congregation – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and a decade later by St. Martins.
The Great White Methodist Church left the church in 1930.
Nearby a black congregation of worshipers took ownership of the building.
A black congregation under Reverend John Howard Johnson took over St. Martins, who led a boycott against retailers on A Hundred and Twenty Fifth Street for refusing to provide jobs and promote black workers – a major road to shopping in Harlem.
The building was badly damaged in a fire accident in 1939, but when Father Johnson's Parish residents planned to restore it, they arranged for the construction of the carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, father Johnson's son and heir to St. Martin's, proudly named Carillon as "the bell of the poor."
The expert who played Carillon in July called it something different: "A historical asset" and "an irreplaceable historical musical instrument."
Tiffany Nyong, an expert at the University of Michigan, also said that it is the orthodox carolina of the earth that is served by a black dwarf, which is Bajan Deonio A. Lind, who was hired 18 years ago to play the larger carillon in the Riverside church.
Mr. Marriott said that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has happened in St. Martins over the past few months is a complex case of architects and contractors who are appointed by the general church leaders or Episcopal Dioceses.
Vestry – the governing body of Paris, which consists of general leaders – expressed their concern in July that they thought Dioscis would “transfer costs” of the Vestree, although Vestry was not involved in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by Diocese.
Some members of the Parish have complained of a lack of transparency in the work of Diocese.
In California, a 13-year-old has been injured in a shark attack after he drowned in a gorge to catch a shrimp.
A 13-year-old boy was injured in a shark attack after he drowned on the first day of the Galda shrimp season on Saturday, officials said.
The attack took place before 7 a.m. on Bikinis Beach, near the NCinitas.
Chad Hamel told San Diego's KSWB TV he heard the boy screaming for help when he drowned with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning, pedaling there and helping a group of people get him out of the water.
Hamel said he initially thought the boy was flirting with the pleasure of grabbing a dirt shrimp, but then “understand that the boy was screaming, ‘Killing me!’”
“They bite me!”
His voice was broken," said Hamel, as he approached the boy.
"I shout for everyone to get up from the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was airlifted to the Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark is not known.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said at a news briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was not identified as a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered serious injuries to the upper part of his body.
Officials have banned access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Soami in Ncinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Zells said there were more than 135 shark species in the area, most of which are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK market
Sensburys is set to compete with boots, superdrug, and Debenhams in the business of shops, including artifacts decorated with cosmetics such as department stores and specialist support staff.
As part of a strong effort to enter the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion retail market, these large retailing islands will be launched in 11 stores across the country and will be launched in other stores if proven successful. The UK’s retail market is growing as the fashion and home decor market falls.
This investment is coming as supermarkets are once again looking for new ways to fill shelves filled with TVs, microwaves and home furnishings.
The company said it would double its sales to 3,000 products, including Revlon, Easy, Tweezersman and Dr. Poe for the first time.
The already existing cosmetic ranges such as L'Oreal, Mebelin, and Barts Biz will get more space, which will have a separate space for brands like Boots.
The supermarket is rolling out its boutique makeup range so that most of the products are vegan friendly – which has become very popular among young buyers.
In addition, Perfume Vendor The Fragrance Shop will conduct a discounted product distribution test at two Sansburys stores, the first of which was launched last week in Croydon, South London, and the second at Sally Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and buying small quantities of food at local grocery stores means supermarkets have to put in extra effort for buyer gatherings.
Mike Kup, chief executive of Sinsburys, said the outlets should look like a department store as the supermarket chain is competing with discount stores like Aldi and Leadl, and it will have more services and food-non-products.
The company has been setting up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores since the acquisition of the Argos and Habitats chain two years ago, and has also opened a few Habitats, which has increased the sales of grocery products and made the acquisition more profitable.
Efforts to improve the quality of the food and beverage industry have failed.
Sinsburys tested a joint project with the First Fitke Boots of the 2000s but the project was discontinued due to a conflict over how profits from chemist shops in supermarkets would be split.
The new strategy comes after Sinsburys sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Lloyds Pharmacy's owner Celcio.
The company said Lloyds will be part of the plan by adding a luxury range of skincare brands, including La Roche Pozze and Vishi in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix, commercial director of Sensburys, said: “We’ve changed the rice-fields of our islands to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in hiring specially trained staff who will be present to give advice.
Our brand range is designed to meet all kinds of needs and due to the attractive environment and convenient location, we have now become a reliable appliance destination that will challenge the old methods of shopping.”
Peter Jones pulls out of Holly Willowby's <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
TV presenter Holly Willowy Marks & Spencer and ITV to focus on her new deal with Dragons Dan star Peter Jones's lifestyle brand, Peter Jones
Willow doesn't have time for their home furnishings and the accompanying brand trolley.
The business of this pair is compared to Gina Paltrow's Gup brand.
This morning, the 37-year-old actress announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willowby has angered Dan’s star Peter Jones by withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute – aimed at focusing on his new Bumper deal with Marx & Spencer and ITV.
Jones became "aggressive" when in a meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday, the TV's golden girl admitted that she had no time for her new deal - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - because of their home goods and subsidiary brand trolleys.
The business was compared to Gina Paltrow's Gup brand and was expected to double Willow's <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
Willowby, 37, reported his departure from Trolley on Instagram, Jones left Britain on a jet plane for his holiday home.
A source said: "The trolley has been at the top of Holly's priority list so far.
It was part of his long-term future plan that met his economic needs for decades to come.
His decision to withdraw was a surprise to all concerned.
No one could have predicted that the project would start soon.
Marlo's headquarters has a warehouse filling product that is ready for sale."
Experts believe that the company's departure, which is currently one of Britain's most trusted stars, could result in the loss of millions of pounds as they have already invested heavily in products ranging from cushions to candles, clothing and household items, and a possible delay in its inauguration would add to this loss.
This can lead to a long-term friendship.
Willowby, the mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for over a decade.
Willowy started trolling with Cap in 2016 and joined Jones, 52, as president in March 2016.
The couple spends the holidays together and Jones owns 40 per cent stake in Baldwin's TV production firm.
Willowby will be the brand ambassador of M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of the celebrity event at ITV's IAM.
A source close to Jones said last night: "We will not comment on his business dealings."
"We're in love and then we're in love"
He joked that after expressing a positive attitude towards the North Korean leader and making a comment that some would consider "non-presidential".
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his "newspaper" voice.
"I didn't give up."
He said Kim was keen to meet for the second time after their initial meeting in Singapore in June. Trump claimed their first meeting was a huge step towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
Nuclear disarmament talks have come to a halt.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that there was no "relevant response" from the United States to North Korea's previous disarmament measures.
However, he said the United States has imposed a ban on the use of force.
During his speech at the rally, Trump expressed a more positive outlook.
"We are in a good position with North Korea," he said.
"We are at war with North Korea.
It could have killed millions of people.
We have a good relationship now."
He claims his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results – which has dragged the end of the rocket tests, helped free the prisoners and bring the rest of the American workers back home.
And he supported his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to behave in a presidential manner, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people out of this crowded area, there were only 200 people standing here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
An earthquake and tsunami hit an island in Indonesia, killing hundreds of people
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign private companies were told they did not need help.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's people were displaced, no national disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have very clearly stated that they are not requesting international cooperation, so the issue is challenging," Sambong said.
Although a team is gathering to go to Save the Children's Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign workers will be able to work on the field.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether foreign agencies would be allowed to participate in relief operations.
Despite the frequent earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is unprepared to deal with nature's fury.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Ache, other coastal areas have seen shelters.
Despite the warning, the apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu may have had an impact on life losses.
Traveling to many islands in Indonesia is challenging even when the time is very good.
Natural disasters make the communication system more vulnerable.
A ship is going to the hospital in Lombok to take care of the victims, but it will take at least three days for the ship to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo put Indonesia's development of the hegemonic infrastructure at the center of his election campaign and he invested huge sums of money in the construction of roads and railways.
But the lack of investment before next year's re-election has left Mr. Jokore's government in a quandary.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from Indonesia's long-standing communal tensions, where the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative lifestyle of their religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were left homeless in the riots between Christians and Muslims. Two groups clashed on the streets with rioters, arrows, and other sharp weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Starz's goal in the match against Chelsea
Daniel Stars saved Liverpool from a 89-minute loss to Chelsea in the Premier League at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Zardan Shakiri's pass was received while he was 30 metres away from the Starz Chelsea goalpost, his team was 1-0 behind.
He first took the ball to the left and then took a shot towards the far post.
The shot moves to the right corner of the net at the top of the box.
In the end, the ball crossed the jumping capa arizabalaga and entered the net.
"It's important to get to the right position to catch the ball in time, because players like Shakib always stretch the ball as much as possible before, so I was trying to give myself as much time as possible," Starz told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I give Kante a thumbs up because I see Kante coming forward and don't think too much of a goal shot."
Belgian star Aden Hazard scored in the 25th minute to lead Chelsea 1-0 in half-time.
The Blues striker, Matteo Kovacic passed, then ran from midfield to Liverpool's Hafe.
Kovacs went ahead with the ball in the midfield.
He then gave Hazard a beautiful ball in the box at the defence chir in Liverpool.
Hazard defeated the defense's players in the run and reached the goal with a shot to the left of the net in the far post.
At 3 pm on Wednesday, Stadio San Paulo in Naples, Italy will take on Napoli in the group stage of the Liverpool Champions League.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League in London at 3pm on Thursday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832.
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster management agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people are said to have been trapped in the rubble of the building that collapsed after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake. The quake struck on Friday and caused 20 feet of waterlogging, the company’s spokesman Sutopo Purouo Nugraro said at a conciliation conference.
The city of Palu, a population of 380,000, is filled with the ruins of the destroyed buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man in connection with the murder of a woman
A murder investigation has been launched this morning after a woman's body was found in Berkeley.
The body of a 44-year-old woman who was stabbed to death was found at 7:55 am on John Street in Grayson Moose, a 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have invited the public in the area to inform them if they see or hear anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I'm appealing to anyone around John Street in Berkenhead to contact us if the suspect sees or hears anything."
I appeal to everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have any footage on their dash cameras, to contact us because they may have essential information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the victim was a resident of Barcahead and her body was found inside a house.
Friends, who think this woman is known to them, arrived at the scene this morning and asked where the body of the woman was found.
The investigation is ongoing and the police said they were trying to inform the woman's relatives.
When a taxi driver in Grayson Moose tried to enter his flat, police told him that no one was allowed to enter or exit the building.
He was shocked to hear about the incident.
Residents of the building are told that it will take several hours to allow them to enter.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene crying.
He said: “It’s very sad.
Two police vans were inside the barricade at 2 p.m. and another one outside the barricade.
Within the barricade, a group of police officers were observing the blocks of flats.
If anyone has any information, they are requested to send a direct message directly to <0x40>MerPolCC or call 101 or anonymously on Crimestoppers on 0800 55511, on 30 September, by calling log 247.
Parliament’s Chromwell statue ‘history rewrites’ new victim
The statue will be removed after the Taliban's destruction of many of England's cultural and religious monuments at the hands of its radical followers.
But the Cromwell Society has notified Mr. Crick's advice as "intelligent" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current controversy of removing the statue, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell, set outside Westminster Palace, would become the target.
The act of destroying iconoclasm or patterns during the English Civil War was not performed by or under the command of Cromwell.
In the previous century, the statue of the wrong Chromwell will be demolished as a result of the work of his predecessor Thomas.
The extraordinary statue of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thornicroft, is a reflection of the opinion of the 19th century and part of a historical character that many consider worthy of celebration.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people consider Chromewell to be the protector of the parliament in the face of external pressure, in his case, against the pressure of the monarchy - which is now the opinion of fewer people but many in the 19th century.
But whether or not this is a perfect picture of that time is part of the ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th century conflict has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known character who has represented a party to this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector deserve to be celebrated and remembered.”
The pig was killed by a Chinese farmer.
According to local media reports, a pig has attacked a farmer in a market in southwest China.
The man, identified only as his surname "Yuan," was found near a pig stall in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig breeder in Shining, China's Qinghai province, is preparing to vaccinate pigs at a pig farm.
According to the petition, he along with his Fupato brother came to the market on Wednesday for the sale of 15 pigs from the nearby Yunnan province.
The next morning, his step-brother found him dead and found the door of a pig's ashtab next to him open.
He said that there was a large male pig in the astral that had blood on his face.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound pig had attacked the farmer, the report said.
"My uncle's legs were bleeding and bruised," said Fupato, who has been identified by his surname "U," citing Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The man who killed the pig is not the man or his foe.
A market manager told the Evening News that police were gathering evidence at the scene and the pig was kept in isolation so that it could not attack anyone else.
Yuan's family and market authorities are in talks to determine the amount of compensation for his death.
Although rare, there have been instances of pigs being attacked before.
In 2016, a woman and her husband attacked a pig on their farm in Massachusetts, injuring the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig <0x58>en Welsh pushed the farmer into his tractor until his wife came in and scares him away.
In 2012, after a farmer in Oregon ate his pig, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but can act as a "trigger or stimulant" to taste blood.
"They're just messing up.
They give small bites, very interested animals... but don't try to hurt anyone.
But you have to work hard on them," he said.
Hurricane Rosser's remains will cause heavy rains throughout the southwestern United States.
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening the power of the cyclone during its run over the colder waters in the northern coastal region of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will cause heavy rainfall in the northern part of Mexico and the southwestern part of the United States.
Today at 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with a speed of 85 miles per hour, and 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugene, Mexico.
We're heading north on Sunday.
In this direction, a strait has begun to take shape in the Pacific and is heading east toward the West Coast of the United States. On Monday Rosa Baha will hit the California Peninsula as a seasonal storm and it will push deep tropical humidity northwards towards the southwestern United States.
There will be up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the deep tropics will be associated with the system that is moving towards moisture and will cause heavy rainfall in the coming days across the southern region.
Locally ranging from 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flash flooding, landslides and possible landslides in the desert.
Due to deep tropical humidity, the rainfall at various places can range from 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall is likely to be between 2 and 4 inches in various parts of southwestern region, especially in most parts of Arizona.
Due to the scattered speed of the tropical monsoon, it is possible to flush flying and degrade the situation very quickly.
Walking in the desert under the threat of tropical rain will be a very silly task.
Due to heavy rains, the canyon shells can turn into a terrible river and there will be strong winds, including dust, due to thunderstorms.
Heavy rainfall will occur locally in parts of southern California's coastal region due to the stormy waters.
Rainfall such as this can be up to half an inch, which can lead to small debris streams on shiny roads.
This will be the region's first rainy season.
There may be some scattered tropical rains in Arizona from Sunday night and Monday morning, after which the rains will increase and spread throughout the area from Monday night to Tuesday.
The heavy rainfall will reach the four corners on Tuesday and will continue till Wednesday.
In October, some extreme temperature changes can be seen in different parts of the United States as the Arctic cools down, but tropical temperatures are still quite warm.
This can sometimes lead to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
Sunday is a great example of a dramatic change in temperature in the United States.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa is about 20 degrees.
In the next few days, the heat of summer will try to rise and spread again.
Most parts of the U.S. central and eastern U.S. are expected to warm by October, with temperatures as high as 80 in areas ranging from the southern plains to the northeast.
On Tuesday, the temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees, which is about 10 degrees higher than the average temperature.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests that the temperature in the eastern U.S. in the first half of October is likely to be much higher than the average temperature.
Brett Kavanaugh's hearing has been viewed by more than 20 million people.
The shocking testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and his alleged sexual assault by Christine Blazi Ford, which took place in the 1980s, saw more than 20 million viewers across six television networks on Thursday.
In this direction, the political controversy continues, with broadcasters suspending regular events due to last-minute surprises on Friday: an agreement made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI will have a week to investigate the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Kavana was drunk at a high school party and tried to open her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in an emotional testimony that he was 100 percent sure the incident didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people have seen the action on Friday, as mentioned in Nielsen's report.
The company was accounting for the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Other networks, which broadcast the activity, were not available immediately with the number of viewers, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually faces problems with the quality of the audience he sees sitting in the office.
The number of visitors to the event was the same as the Play of Football or the Academy Awards.
The Fox News channel, whose views were strongly supported by the show's presenters, attracted the highest number of viewers across all networks broadcasting the day-to-day hearing, with an average of 5.69 million, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS watched 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC watched 2.89 million, and CNN watched 2.52 million viewers, Nielsen said.
There was still interest after the hearing.
Fleck was the central character of today's play.
After a statement by the moderate Republican's office that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on camera by CNN and CBS on Friday morning, when he boarded the elevator to reach the Judicial Committee hearing site and protesters shouted for him.
He was standing in front of the protesters for a few minutes, which was broadcast live by CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think Kevin is telling the truth to the country?"
She is told, "You have power, when many women are helpless."
Fleck said his office made a statement and before the lift was closed, he said he had more to say at the committee's hearing.
Later, when the Judicial Committee voted to move Kavanaugh's nomination to a full Senate vote, all of the cable and broadcasting networks broadcast live.
But Fleck said he would vote on the condition that the FBI investigate allegations against the nominee next week, which were requested by minority Democrats.
His conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Cun, has partially affected Flake's decision.
After speaking to Kun, Fleck spoke to a few other senators and reached his decision.
Fleck's decision was bleak, as it was clear that Republicans had no vote to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation based on allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of playing “politics game” over Brexit
In an interview with Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of playing "political games" about Britain's future and disregarding the nation's interests.
On September 29, 2018, British Prime Minister Theresa May attended the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK.
In another interview printed next to his interview on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued to criticize May's so-called checkers plan for Brexit, saying Britain and the European Union offered to collect each other's revenues "absolutely unreasonable."
Wed Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dayton Simpson over LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the shooting of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wade Sims.
Dayton Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed for second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the scuffle.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said that the DNA of Simpson was found in the glasses, a CBS associate WAFB said in a report.
After Simpson was arrested, police said he had confessed to shooting Wade.
According to The Advocate's report, his bail has been fixed at $350,000.
The Office of the Dying Investigator in the East Baton Rouge area released a preliminary report on Friday, citing injuries to the head and neck as the cause of death.
The department is credited with helping with the investigation of the Louisiana State Police's Escaped Offenders Task Force, the State Police's Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and residents of the area, which led to the arrest of the accused.
The LSU Athletic Director Joe Alva thanked the law enforcement agency in the area for its "relentless efforts and pursuit of justice."
Simmons was 20 years old.
The forward baton was raised 6 feet 6 inches in height, where his father played basketball for Wayne and LSU.
Last season, he scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said on Friday morning that the team was "deeply saddened" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
"It's always a matter of concern," Wade said.
Fireworks in Mexico City
A volcanic eruption from the Popocatepet volcano has reached the southern part of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Response Center warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to stay away from volcanic activity after the volcano's face increased and gas and smoke levels reached a scale of 183 within 24 hours.
The center was observing a number of roars and tremors.
Images posted on social media showed the car's windshield plummeting in areas like Joachimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in volcanic eruptions since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck Mexico in September 2017, just 45 miles (72 km) south of the capital.
The volcano known as "Don Goo" has been active since 1994.
Clashes with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday in clashes with pro-independence protesters as they joined opposition protesters to celebrate the first year of the vote, centering on Catalonia's independence.
A group of masked separatists threw eggs, and coloured powders at the police in the face of obstacles, causing black clouds on the streets, usually filled with tourist gatherings.
Later in the day, the gunmen also used a police force to stop them.
For several hours, protesters chanted "Forget not, forgive not" in front of unity supporters who chanted "Long live Spain."
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries caused by the protests, local media reported.
Tensions have been brewing in the country since Madrid declared the October 1 referendum illegal, which is celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The majority of voters voted in favor of independence, although the number of voters was low because the majority of the population opposed secession boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were killed in clashes with police in the region last year as they were prevented from voting during the general elections.
Freedom fighters were on the streets all night on Friday to block demonstrations in support of the national police.
Protesters continued their activities, but were forced to take to different streets.
The 68-year-old Norris Termis, a power activist who participated in separatist protests with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about Catalonia's independence.
Last year was one of the best years of our lives.
"I've seen the water coming into my parents' eyes, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite significant but narrow victories in provincial elections last December, Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain their momentum where many of their well-known leaders are awaiting trial for voluntarily exiled or detained for their organization's role in the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who is recording the protest in support of police on her phone, said the dispute was created by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting worse day by day,” he added.
On Saturday, Oriole Junkeras, one of the Catalan leaders who is not in pre-trial prisons, announced late last year that he would take part in next year's European Parliament elections.
“The best way to prevent the suppression and oppression of democratic values from the Spanish government is to stand as a candidate for the European elections,” he said.
London Derry: Man arrested after car collision with his house.
Three men, 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after they were repeatedly hit by a car at a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Balinagard Crescent at 19:30 Bangladesh time on Thursday.
Deputy Inspector Bob Bloomings said the gates and buildings were damaged.
At some point, the car may have been shot and killed.
Menger's goal won by 1-0 against the Rangers in Livingston.
Dolly Menger's first goal for Livingston confirmed the win.
Steven Gerrard was awarded the second defeat in 18 games as the director of the Ibrox Club by the progressive Livingston Rangers.
Dolly Menger created the gap as Gary Holt's team equalised with the Hibernians with a second goal.
As a result, Gerard's team left without a win in the Premiership this season, and next Sunday they will face the top-ranked Hearts, who are eight points ahead of them.
Earlier, Rangers Rapid will host Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, who has already extended their unbeaten run in the division to six games, has yet to taste the defeat of head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses a lot of chances against his uncontested opponents.
They should have been ahead long before Holt's team scored, as their aggressive attitude caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers!
When Scott Robinson broke through the defense but failed to yield to his own efforts, Allan Lithgow could only drive his effort to the Windies after sliding over to meet Craig Halkett's header.
In the set-piece, the hosts were letting the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that the guests could get into trouble.
And that strategy came with an important goal.
Rangers concocted a free-kick and opened the Livingston goalkeeper's account. Declan Gallagher and Robinson gathered to set up Menga, who scored from the center of the box in one touch.
At this stage, the Rangers dominated the ball possession but they were aware of the hosts' defense as impermissible, and goalkeeper Liam Kelley spent most of the time e-bowling.
This trend continued even in the second half, though Alfredo Morlos fired a shot at Kelly.
Scott Pittman was defeated at the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor and won another set-piece for Livingston from Lithgow Wide.
The crosses were constantly coming to the Livingston box and were becoming increasingly clearer, though the claim of two penalties - the alternative Glenn Middleton - was rejected after Hallett's challenge and for the handball.
" The Incredible " Celebrity Livingston - Analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont Tony McCarney
It's a great performance and results for Livingstone.
To some person, they were great, continuing to exceed everyone's expectations at their upward speed.
Their style of play and players have rarely changed since returning to the top level, but the credit has to go to Holt for the way he has teamed up since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was extraordinary, created a wonderfully organized defense, and kept the menga Connor Goldson and Joe Warhol on the board at all times.
The Rangers, however, were less motivated.
They were as good as they were under Gerard.
They lacked the final ball - only once they opened the hosts - and that's a warning to the Rangers, who are now in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an found in Cologne
The situation was very pleasant when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for a Brexit meeting in Berlin on Saturday.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which is aimed at repairing relations between NATO allies.
They discussed human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then proceeded to Cologne for the opening of a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police have made a security cover to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but a large number of supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurdish - were heard condemning both Erdogan's policy and his decision to welcome him into the country in Germany.
These conflict demonstrations prove that one visitor is hailed as a hero by the German Turks and condemned by others as a dictator.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist killed in car collision
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, south-east of the city, at around 10 a.m. Bangladesh time.
The driver stopped the vehicle and the cyclist was given primary treatment, but the man died on the spot.
The accident happened again a few months after another bike accident on Children's Street, which is located 1 mile away from the crash site on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said officials were working to identify the man and inform his next relatives.
The road has been closed and bus stops have been put in place and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lorraine Jail: Six officers were injured in the chaos.
Six officers were injured in the high security men's prison chaos, the Prison Office said.
Clashes broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at 9:30 am on Sunday and it is going on.
Specialist "tornedo" officers have been brought in to deal with the chaos, including eight prisoners who are included in a branch.
Officers at the scene were treated for injuries to the face.
A spokesman for a Prison Service said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to deal with an incident going on in HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of staff have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the perpetrators will be taken under the law and they will spend a long time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison administrator had gone to the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, Rayot officers were called to the prison to deal with a serious chaos where workers were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City. (Although drought prone areas may benefit)
Tropical depression is rare in Arizona, but that seems to happen as early as next week when Hurricane Rojas will continue to thrive with its residual strength across the southwestern desert, including the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorological Department has already issued flash flood watches in Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City cities, including southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah in western Arizona for Monday and Tuesday.
Roza is expected to arrive directly over the Phoenix on Tuesday and with rain by the end of Monday.
The National Meteorological Department of Phoenix noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or low pressure conditions within 200 miles of Phoenix since the 1950s!"
Katrina (1967) which was a hurricane within 40 miles of the A-Z border."
The latest model of the National Hurricane Center predicts rainfall ranging from 2 to 4 inches, at the Moguln Rime in Arizona, which can range up to 6 inches in isolated amounts.
Other areas in the southwestern desert, including Central Rockies and Great Basin, are likely to receive roughly 1 to 2 inches of rain, which can range up to 4 inches in isolated amounts.
Fast rain can be a blessing for people out of flood risk as areas are prone to drought
Although the floods are a matter of serious concern, the rains are likely to be of some benefit as the southwest is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to U.S. drought monitoring, more than 40 percent of Arizona is facing extreme drought, according to Weather.com, the second-highest category.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path will cause landslides across the Gulf of Mexico's Baja California peninsula.
Rosa, a still powerful hurricane, is moving at a maximum speed of 85 mph on Sunday morning, 385 mph south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and 12 mph north.
The storm is making it harder to face cold water in the Pacific Ocean.
So, the force of the tropical storm is expected to make landfall in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rains may occur across parts of Mexico, creating a significant flood risk.
"There is a chance of rain up to 10 inches from Baja California to northwestern Sonora."
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical depression before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning, and it will enter southern Utah via Arizona on Tuesday night.
"The main danger expected from the roza or its remains is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and southwestern deserts of the United States," according to the National Hurricane Center.
These rains can lead to life-threatening floods and devastating currents in the desert and landslides in mountainous areas.
In Midsummer's Norton, four people were arrested.
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested in Somerset after a 16-year-old man was found stabbed to death.
A teenage boy was found injured in the Accelcior Terrace area of Midsummer Norton around 4pm on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where he is now in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstok area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Officers have requested those who may have mobile phone footage to come forward.
Trump has said that the Democratic Party's "seriousness, anger."
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and ruthless strategy of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh was "serious, angry" of the Democratic Party throughout the process of his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and passionately denying the allegations by Christine Blasey Ford that she had been subjected to sexual abuse at her hands decades before she was a teenager.
Ford also testified at the hearing of his complaint.
The president said Saturday that “the American people saw the extraordinary and qualities and courage of Kavanaugh that day.”
Speaking to supporters in West Virginia, he said a vote on behalf of Jazz Kavanaugh would be a vote to protect the most successful legal right of our time, a jurist with a public service sterling record."
Speaking about the importance of Republican voting in the midterm elections, the president unequivocally acknowledged Kavanaugh's nomination.
"It's only five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
"Even though I'm not taking part, I'm really taking part," he said.
"That's why I'm always striving to fight for great candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats were on a mission to "resist and prevent."
The Senate's first major presidential vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is not expected to take place on Friday, a senior GOP-led ally told CNN.
Hundreds of people have been killed in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
At least 384 people have been killed and many have drowned after a massive wave hit a beach on Indonesia's Sulawesi island, authorities said on Saturday.
Thousands of people gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when a six-metre (18 feet) high wave broke out on the beach in the evening, driving many people to their deaths and destroying everything along the way."
The earthquake was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"People were continuing their activities on the beach even when there was a tsunami threat yesterday, and those who could not run immediately and they became victims," said Sutopo Puro, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency, at a briefing in Nugroho Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come by itself, it dragged all of the cars, logs, houses, it hit everything above the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled at speeds of 800 kilometers (497 miles) per hour in the open sea before hitting the shore.
Some people climbed trees to survive the tsunami, and they survived.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Images from the sky published by the disaster agency showed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges turned upside down and collapsed, and a mosque submerged in water.
Saturdays are also on the coast of the city.
The earthquake was felt in the region of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the force liberated by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times the capacity of a nuclear bomb in World War II's Hiroshima.
The geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, can further increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "massive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Some of the bodies were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed building, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing."
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater in an area called Dangala near the epicenter of the earthquake, along the coast, 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu.
The communication system was "completely decomposed without any information," Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that workers and volunteers were moving to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
The agency was heavily criticised on Saturday for not giving information that the tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the waves came only when the warning was issued.
Footage of the raw hand shared on social media showed a man on the top floor of the building shouting to people on the lower street and listening to a tsunami warning.
Within minutes, a wall-mounted stream of water hit the shore and flooded buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to immediately confirm the footage.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a power outage that cut communication around the Palu and made the authorities' rescue operation inconvenient.
The military has started sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, adding that rescuers are now in great need of food and other basic essentials.
The city's airport has been reopened only for relief efforts and will remain closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit Palu's shelters on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
That's terrible.
According to Mr. Dosseau, when the World Organization's staff were traveling safely from Dongala to the city of Palu, where the employees were taking shelter in their office courtyards, they saw images of the destruction on the road.
"They've seen a lot of houses destroyed," Doseba said.
That's sad.
Even when aid teams went to start disaster relief operations, some were complaining that foreign aid workers were being barred from travelling to Palu with a lot of skill.
According to Indonesian law, foreign funding, food supplies and staff can only come when a disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
But it has not been announced yet.
"It's still a province-level disaster," said Auliya Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"If the government says yes, it is a national disaster," he said, "we can start international aid, but there is no announcement yet."
Even on the second night of Friday's tsunami strike in Palu, friends and family of the missing are hoping for a miracle that will bring the light of hope at the end of a brutal chapter of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy was taken from the North Pole.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been stabbed to death by her mother for two days.
Indonesian national paragliding team coach Jendon Subandono trained two paragliders at the Asian Games, who are now missing, which took place in Indonesia earlier this month.
Mr. Mendagi also mentioned that those who were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
"As a pioneer in the field of paragliding, I have a responsibility for my own emotions," he added.
Mr. Jendon recalled how the news of the Rua roa hotel collapse spread to the paragliding community hours later, he backtracked and spread it to the Palu contestants via WhatsApp message, who took part in a festival on the beach.
Instead of sending a message, it was deleted.
He said, "That means the message was not sent."
The thieves stole $26,750 when they re-entered the ATM machine at Liv's Newport.
The Newport Police Department said in a press release that the thieves stole $26,750 on Friday morning when Brinks staff kept the money at ATMs.
The driver was emptying ATM money in the entertainment complex and was ready to pay more. Detective Dennis McCarthy told a news conference.
While he was working, another "run from the back of a Brinks worker" and ran away with a money-filled bag that was ready to be handed over.
According to the press release, witnesses have seen many suspects fleeing, but police have not yet specified the number of people involved in the incident.
If anyone can identify these individuals, they are being asked to contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kane West: This rapper has changed his name.
Rapper Kane West has changed his name.
Announcing the change, he wrote on Twitter on Saturday: “Formally known as Kane West.”
West, 41, was also known as Ye for a long time, and he used the name as his surname.
The subject of this name change was revealed before her appearance on T-Saturday Night Live, where she hoped to unveil her new album Yandy.
The show's producer said he was replacing singer Ariana Grande, who canceled the show "for "excited reasons."
West had previously said that the term was of religious significance to him, as well as a shortened form of his current professional name.
At the beginning of the West year, when discussing the title of the album with radio broadcaster Big Boy, he said, "I believe that 'Ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'."
"I am you, you are us, we are you.
It is said from Cain that the only person, Y, reflects our good, bad, our confusion, everything.
This album reflects more of our identity.”
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their names.
Shawn Combs is known as Puff Daddy, PDD or DD in various ways, but this year he declared Love and Brothers Love as the preferred name.
J-G, a former West ally, has worked with Hyphene, without Hyphene, and with the capital.
Mexico's AMLO has vowed not to use military force against civilians.
Mexico's President-elect Andr<0xC3><0xA9>s Manuel Lopez has vowed not to use military force against civilians on the 50th anniversary of the bloodshed against students.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Ab<0xC3><0xA1>dor promised Saturday at the Toltec<0xC3><0xB3> Plaza that “Don’t use military force to oppress the people of Mexico.”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on peaceful protests that killed 300 people while the left-wing student movement in Latin America was building a strong position.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Abrado apologized to the young Mexicans with the help of monthly education allowances and the creation of more government universities.
He said the lack of education and employment opportunities has led to a rise in crime rates.
The U.S. should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States and the United States should also double the amount spent on research in this area, said artificial intelligence researcher and investor Kai-fu Li, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The statement comes from various parts of the government, announcing in the United States that there is a formal strategic deficit in artificial intelligence in the United States.
China has already launched its new plan last year: it aims to rank number one in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
“Double-budget in artificial intelligence research will be a good new start, with most countries lagging far behind, and we’re looking for the next step to advance artificial intelligence.”
Double funding could double the chances of the U.S. achieving the next big artificial intelligence, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “All Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” this month, Hutton Mifflin Harcourt, chief executive of Innovation Ventures, has invested in Face<0x2B><0x2B>, one of China’s leading artificial intelligence companies.
In the 1980s, Carnegie worked on an artificial intelligence system at Mellon University that defeated the highest-ranked American player, and he was the executive of Microsoft Research and the president of Google's China branch.
Li acknowledged the technology competition of the previous U.S. government, like the robotics challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency, to determine the next step.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee said.
"China is not removing academic leaders; the corporates are doing it," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired illustrators from universities to work in artificial intelligence.
Lee said the changes in immigration policy could help boost the U.S.'s AI efforts.
“I think the green card should be offered automatically to PhDs in artificial intelligence,” he said. SI’s AI efforts further intensified.
China's State Council issued its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions, such as the National Science Foundation and other government agencies that spend money on U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is low, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint artificial intelligence center, which means involving industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of an election committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month the DRPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As an NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million per year in research in artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation seeking to form a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not seen progress in a few months.
Macedonians voted in a referendum on whether to change the country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether to keep the name "Republic of North Macedonia," a move that would resolve decades-old conflicts with Greece that blocked attempts to gain membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where there is a province called Macedonia, its northern neighbor's name represents a claim to its territory and vetoes the entry of NATO and the European Union.
The two governments signed a deal in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slavic population in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov has said he will not vote in a referendum and doubts whether turnout will meet the minimum 50 percent needed to legalize a public vote in a boycott campaign.
The question in the referendum ballot was: “You are for NATO and the membership of the European Union with the recognition of the agreement with Greece.”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Joran Zaev, have argued for paying the price for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to be admitted to the European Union and NATO.
"I'm here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safe life for all of us," said Olivier Georgievskaya Skopje, 79.
Although not legally binding, adequate members of parliament have said they will abide by the outcome of the vote by making decisions.
A two-thirds majority is needed to change the name.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities by 1 pm.
However, the turnout in the 2016 parliamentary elections was just 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent of registered voters.
"I have come to vote because of my children, we have a place in Europe," said Jos<0xC3><0xA9> Tenevsky, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Joran Zaev, his wife Jorka and his son Dushko voted to change the country's name to the referendum in Macedonia, which will open the way for NATO and the European Union to join the Macedonia's Strumica on September 30, 2018.
In Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavdarkov was preparing a small stage in front of parliament and pulling a chair in front of tents set up for those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are on the side of NATO and the European Union, but we want to join our heads up, not through the door of service," Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can go to others like China and Russia and be part of the Euro-Asia solidarity.”
Prime Minister Zaev said the NATO membership would bring the necessary investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I believe the vast majority will support because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of the European Union and NATO," he said.
He said that a "yes" result would be our "confirmation of the future."
A poll published on Monday by the Institute for Policy Research in Macedonia said that 30 to 43 percent of voters will vote in the referendum below the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian Telma TV found that 57 percent of the respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote yes.
More than 50 percent of the vote is needed to be successful.
The failure of the referendum will represent the first fatal blow to the policies of the pro-Western government since taking power in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero enter into the entire Brighton defense for goal
Manchester City's 2-0 win at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester on Saturday saw both Sergio Aguero and Rahim Stirling defeating Manchester City.
Aguero made it extra easy to see his score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker got a pass in the midfield at the start of the sequence.
He ran through three Brighton defenders before going into the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green jerseys.
He turned to a defender before he overtook several others at the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he pushed a pass to the left, which found Sterling.
The English forward returned the ball to Aguero using his first touch in the box, who used his right boot to shoot on the right side of the net, defeating Brighton defender Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems in his legs," city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about his game for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are fortunate that he scored a goal at that moment."
However, Starling gave Sky Blues the primary advantage of the Premier League fight.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero found the ball deep in the Brighton area in that game.
He sent the ball to Leroy Sen with a beautiful path on the left side edge.
Sen took a few touches before taking sterling to a distant post.
Sky Blues forward tapped the ball into the net just before it crossed the boundary.
The City Champions League group will face Hoffinheim in the semi-finals of the tournament on Tuesday at 12.55pm in the German city of Sinsheim.
Roger Federer wants to play the game
There was not much reason to force the Nationals to start any other after they were removed from the playoffs controversy.
However, the ever-competitive Sherger hopes to take the field against Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the play-offs have an impact on the one-game lead against NL West's Los Angeles Dodgers.
Rockies won 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night to get at least a wild card spot, but they are still looking to win their first division title.
"While we're not playing for anything, at least we can step into the rubber with Denver's spectators knowing the impact and the other team will probably play at the highest level of any point I'm facing this year."
Why don't I want to compete?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but it is said that sheerer could allow the pitcher to in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will start his 34th season, kicked off a Bullpen session on Thursday and will pitch at his usual rest on Sunday.
Washington's right-arm 18-7 with 2.53 ERAs and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's rally in West Virginia
Speaking about the importance of Republican voting in the midterm elections, the president sharply referred to the surrounding situation to his Supreme Court-selected Brett Kavanaugh.
"Everything we did in November is under threat.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's a big, big -- I'm not running but that's why I'm all over the place fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible, terrible Radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take back the energy by using any means necessary, you see this downward, downtroddenness.
They don't care who they're hurting, who they're going to have to suffer to gain power and control, they just want power and control, we're not going to give it to them."
He said Democrats were on a mission to "resist and prevent."
"And you've seen that over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "enraged and downplayed and nasty and untrustworthy."
He has named Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which received high-pitched applause from the audience.
"Do you remember the answer?"
Have you found the link?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, I'm waiting - it was really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a free organization.
People are not allowed to say what they think.
It's no surprise that when the people in my neighborhood voted for me, they voted for me.
Because I was the last Labour MP on the list to announce that your mind-boggling nature will not be welcomed here.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, had a similar attitude because she firmly stood up against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was convicted for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on matters of Europe and national security, and similar issues on which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labor Meeting on Friday stated that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For the first time in my eight years as a local Labour MP, the GC meeting on Friday night was exactly the same.
But unfortunately, today, it is not the tone of that meeting and the promise of "simple, gentle" politics has long been forgotten, if indeed it has ever begun.
It has increasingly appeared that dissent is not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is judged as to whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It started soon after Jeremy became leader, with colleagues I thought I would share a similar political point of view, hoping to get a U-turn on me and take a position that I would not agree with under any circumstances - be it national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly – and though it doesn’t matter what I say – I’m called to be removed by being sly on social media, condemning central politics, and telling me that I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm more fortunate than a few of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are also political.
I am amazed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a storm of discrimination or racial abuse on a daily basis but never feel ashamed.
One of the most frustrating aspects of this era is how the lack of transparency has become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn last week claimed that the Labour Party should build a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a free-will organization, and every "unprecedented" vote or change of election rules narrows the party.
For the past two years, many people have advised me to keep my head down so that I don't get too vocal and that I'll be "okay."
I'm not in politics to do that.
When I joined Labour 32 years ago as a schoolboy, the Thatchers were instigated by the government’s negligence that literally destroyed our extensive school classrooms, I tried to provide the necessary government services to those who needed it the most — whether as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I've never kept my politics secret, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East has been in any way confused about my policy position and the areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who promoted the movement on Friday, I will only say that when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy by showing loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But I really don’t have a message for Nottingham Momentum, whether it’s to my constituents, Labour members or not: I’m proud to serve you, and I promise that any impasse threat or political activity won’t stop me from doing what I believe is the best interest for all of you.
Chris Leslie is an MP from Nottingham East.
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> Income 38-17 Melrose: Rise to the Top of Unearned Income
Two attempts late may reduce the margin of the final result a bit, but there is no doubt that Irene deserved to win in the premiership match of this day's extraordinarily entertaining Tencent.
They are now at the top of the table, the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end, it was their best defense, just as good as their ability to take chances, which helped the hosts win and was the perfect reason for coach Peter Murchi to be happy.
“We’ve been tested in every game so far and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy.”
Melrose’s Robin Christie said: “Iron has to give credit, they’ve done their chances better than we do.”
Grant Anderson's 14th minute attempt, converted by Frazier Clemos, led the Irish forward, however, with a yellow card from Scotland's player Rory Hughes, which expelled him for the game by the Warriors, giving Melrose a majority, and Jason Bagot a failed attempt.
Clemo extended the lead of income by scoring in the penalty, just before halftime, he scored in a single attempt to break 17-5.
But Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's effort, being transformed by Bagot, reduced the gap by five points.
The game was then shut down for a long time due to serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who had become stretchered and after the restart of the game, income went a long way through the efforts of Stafford McDowell, which was transformed by Clemo.
Irene's acting captain Blair McFerson then received a yellow card and once again punished the extra player of Melrose's Bruce Colvin try Ayer after a spell of severe pressure.
However, the hosts came back right away, and when Strawman Hutchinson saw a yellow card to deal with Clemo without the ball, McFarson pulled the ball out of the line and pushed the revenue mall forward.
Once again Klimo converted, Kyle Roe did David Armstrong's box kicks and sent Flanker Gregor Henry out on a fifth try on the home side.
Steel game star ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Steel game star Ford Kieran has said he is ready to enter the hospitality industry after being nominated as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old star played Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he himself wrote and co-starred with longtime comedian Greg Hemfil.
Both have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the show's last series and it looks like Keirana is planning her own life after Craigslist.
According to the official records list, he is the director of AdriftMorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, although Scottish Sun sources indicated that Kieran wanted to be involved in Glasgow's "rich restaurant business."
'The sea is ours': Bolivia's landlocked Bolivia hopes the court will re-open its way to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors are patrolling a rigging clad naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings are flying an ocean-blue flag.
From Lake Titicaca to amazon, the sea is decorated with this motto: "The sea is our right."
It's a responsibility to restore it."
Throughout the landlocked Bolivia, a 19th-century bloody wealth conflict has lost sight of Chile, but the memory of the coast is still clear – just as eager to travel again in the Pacific Ocean.
These expectations are probably the highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice's ruling on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has that speed, unity and unwavering spirit, and of course we look forward to results with a positive outlook," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Caljadilla.
Many Bolivians will see the ICJ ruling on a large screen across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will favor Bolivia's claim that - after decades of appropriate negotiations - Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign outlet to Bolivia at sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's karishmetic indigenous president - who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year - also relies a lot on Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
But some analysts think the court is unlikely to make a decision on Bolivia - and if so, it will change little.
The Netherlands-based UN agency does not have the power to grant land to Chile and says it will not determine the outcome of the possible negotiations.
The ICJ's verdict comes just six months after hearing the final arguments indicating that the case was "not complicated," said Paige Jarrett, an expert in Chilean international law.
And it could have gone back and forth in the last four years rather than pushing Bolivia's cause further.
"The issue of sea entry has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," said Gerett.
Morales's anti-war speech has lifted any surplus wishes from Chile, he said.
Bolivia and Chile may continue to talk up to a stage, but it will be very difficult to discuss later.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Bolivia's representative to The Hague, former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltz, has rejected the court's decision to be unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring an opportunity to "a great opportunity for a new era in relations with Chile" and "to end 139 years of conflict with mutual benefit".
Caljadila also denies that Morales - still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America - is using the maritime issue as a political pillar.
"Bolivia will never give up the right to enter the Pacific," he added.
"It's an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not come until it trusts the United States.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said his nation will not denuclearize if it does not trust Washington.
He made the remarks at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to abide by the commitments made by rival leaders during a summit in Singapore.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on track to resume stalled nuclear diplomacy with North Korea's Kim Jong Un after more than three months in Singapore.
Ri said it was a "pipe dream" that would continue sanctions and threaten North Korea with U.S. objections to the declaration of an end to the Korean War.
Washington has warned that Pyongyang could agree to the declaration without the first significant disarmament process.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about leaving an arsenal, which the country is likely seeing as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris Fashion Shows Reveals The Last Line Of Huge Headwear On The Road To A High Street Near You
If you want to increase your hat collection or block the sun completely, there's no need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Brown unveiled a stream of oversized head gear for their SS19 collection on the runway that shocked the style set at the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer's highly unrealistic hats have been hidden on Instagram and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations to Katwa.
One of the creations of Valentino was an over-the-top beige hat that was equipped with a wide-brimmed hat like a feather that covered the heads of models.
Other oversized accessories include decorative watermelons, a wizard's hat, even a pineapple - but they aren't designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Brown also published a selection of bizarre masks - and at exactly the right time for Halloween.
The lips of many colored masks were stitched and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than horrifying fun.
One creation is similar to the full scuba diving gear with snorkels and goggles, the other looks like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you continue with the big fashion statement - then you're lucky.
Style observers have predicted that huge bunnies can go to the high street near you.
Outsized hats compete with 'La Bomba', a two-foot wide-brimmed straw hat that has been worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The call label on the back of the highly unreasonable hat scattered across social media sent another large creation to Katwa - a straw beach bag that's almost as big as a swimmer's costume model.
Paris Fashion Week was one of the first of the collections of La Rivera's SS19 collection of burnt orange raffia bags, with raffia freezing, and with a white leather handle at the top.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told Fimmel: “I hope that big hats and beach bags will arrive on the high street next summer – as the designer has made such a big impact, it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edwards: Linguistic skills are essential for world citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain a track record of academic excellence, and it continues to produce another outstanding test result in 2018, which is only reinforced by personal and collective success in sports, art, music, and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for more and higher education, for their chosen profession and their place as world citizens.
As an educational field that a particular school can design and implement curriculum, we see modern languages continue to be popular and preferred topics in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.”
If you talk to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It's a strong reminder that we can't rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's recent test results, we can see that languages top the league tables with the highest pass rate among individual schools.
A total of 68% of students studying foreign languages have achieved higher grades.
Data collected from schools of 74 members of SCIS showed that 72 per cent of students achieved higher grades in Mandarin, while 72 per cent achieved higher grades in German, 69 per cent in French, and 63 per cent in Spanish.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language is now, as the subject choice, being held in the same way as individual school curriculum and elsewhere in STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics).
A 2014 study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 percent of employers blamed a lack of language skills for the reasons they struggled to fill the vacancy.
So more and more, language skills are becoming essential for young people to prepare for their future careers.
For more potential job opportunities that require language, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
Anyone who chooses a career, if they learn a second language, will have a real advantage in the future with their lifelong skills.
Being able to communicate directly with people abroad automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 Yugov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent were not able to speak a foreign language well at the time of the conversation, and French was the only language of the decade-number, 15 percent.
That's why investing in language education is important for today's children.
Having multiple languages, especially the language of the developing economy, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will be different in their taught languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while looking at 2020 it is seen that others will teach languages that are considered to be most important to the UK, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be many languages to choose from in individual schools, including expert teaching staff in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing an education environment that will prepare children and build them with the skills necessary to succeed in the future.
In the global business environment it cannot be denied at the moment that languages play an important role for the future of the country, so it must reflect in the field of education.
Indeed, modern languages should indeed be considered as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will provide this choice, diversity, and encouragement for Scotland's youth.
It has to be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to debut at Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
LeBron James's fans are almost finished waiting to see him start his first journey for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Naggets in San Diego.
It is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudeau tweeted that James would probably play a limited minute.
After practicing earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need a preseason game to be ready at this stage of my career," he said.
During Trump's West Virginia rally, the YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will hold a rally in West Virginia tonight.
This is the first of Trump's five scheduled gatherings next week, with stops in friendly places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of confirmation of his election to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump is aiming to build support for the next mid-term election, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress after voting in November.
What time has it been for Trump's West Virginia rally tonight, and how do you see it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally below through the live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak this week about Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's hearing, which has been heated by allegations of sexual abuse with an expected Senate confirmation vote during an FBI investigation.
But the primary goal of the opening of these rallies is to help Republicans gain some momentum in the face of the November election.
In this way, President Trump's campaign said that the purpose of these five rallies next week is to "emphasize volunteers and supporters, as Republicans seek to protect and expand their majority under the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters reported.
"Congress control is so important for its agenda that as soon as we enter the busy campaign season, the president will travel to as many states as possible," Trump said in a statement.
Scheduled for the Wesbenko Arena at Wheeling, today's rally "can bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and bring coverage from the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
This is the second time Trump has visited West Virginia since last month, the state he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
In the run-up to the election, Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate, Patrick Morris, who is lagging behind.
"It's not a very good sign for Morrissey that the president should try to give him more incentive in the election," said Simon Heder, a West Virginia University politician.
Rider Cup 2018: Team USA looks hungry to keep hope alive in Sunday's singles
The four-team race was scheduled for Saturday afternoon at the end of three one-sided sessions.
Momentum's pendulum swing is a fully-invented sport concept but it's something that the players really believe in, and the most in such a competition.
Where are they going to tell Momma?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so I think we have a little momentum now," Jordan Spieth said.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with 12 more games remaining to go in four points.
As Spieth said, Americans think they have some help along the way and they can be inspired by a lot of things, especially the forms of Spitt and Justin Thomas who have played all day together, and they have both taken four to three points each.
Spieth was fatal from the beginning to the end and is leading from the front.
As his rounds went on, he was getting stronger with the shouts of celebration, while he and Thomas trailed by two points after scoring two, making an important jutting out of the four-point total square match.
His jute that won the match on 15 received the same kind of shout, which tells you a lot that he believes the American team is not out of it.
"You have to go really deep and think about your own match," Spieth said.
All of these players have it now.
There are 18 holes to make a mark.
The players who have scored more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas are only Francisco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange but adorable pair of four to four and can't make any mistakes.
"Mollywood" was the only pair who didn't shoot any bogies on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided bogies on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and Friday mornings at the back nine.
That run, and the manner in which their strengths were flowing from and towards this enthusiastic crowd, seemed to be the players they lost on Sunday, and with the sun setting on Le Golf National, there is no more likely popular player to seal the European victory without Fleetwood or Mullinary.
It's better to have both at the same time.
The European pride, however, remains intact.
Buba Watson and Web Simpson had some problems for the morning's foreball hero Sergio Garcia while pairing up with Alex Norrene.
In the first nine, a bogey and two double Spaniards threw Sweden into a hole from which they could never get up.
On Sunday, though, there's no one to get you out of your hole.
The mutual interaction between the pairings, which they suggest, is very interesting to see from close to Foreball and Foursome due to the fact that they do not suggest and the technique that can change instantly.
Europe has played relatively well as a team so far and has taken an important lead on the final day but this foursome session has also proved that Team USA's hunger for fighting is something that some, notably Stateside doubted.
Europe took a 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will take a healthy lead of 10-6 against the United States in Saturday's foreball and foursome matches on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
The excited pair, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Mullinary, have now taken their tally to four points at the Golf Nationals, leading them to a two-time victory over the two-wicketed Tiger Woods.
The European team of Thomas Jorne, bid to recover the lost trophy to Hazeltin two years ago, blew up the flawed American side in the morning foreballs and won the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in Foursome after winning two matches, but they could not meet the shortfall.
Jim Furick's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to recover the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row and he and Malinari, the only pair to score four points from the first four matches in Ryder Cup history after an extraordinary weekend.
Pushing Woods and Patrick Reed into the foreball, they then imprisoned a losing Woods and the American Rookie Brison Decambyu for a superb Superbly to beat them by 5 and 4.
Woods, who pulled himself up in both games on Saturday, occasionally stormed the limelight but has now lost 19 matches and seven draws in 29 of his four-ball and four-sum matches.
Justin Rose, taking a rest for the morning for the Foreballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the Foursomes defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepkar 2 and 1 - world number one and 3.
A pleasant, windy day on the southwest side of Paris, although Europe did not have it on its own.
Three-time major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won 2 and 1 against Spain's Zone Ram and Ian Polter in the Foreballs, and lost the opening two holes in the Foursomes to Polter and Rory McLroy in 4 and 3.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team has returned from a four-point shortfall in a single season, although as of now only a draw is needed to recover the trophy from Furick's side.
After being the second best for two days, however, Sunday's counterattack looks like it will overtake them.
North Korea says it will not be "unilaterally disarmed" without faith.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the current sanctions are deepening distrust of the United States and that the country has no chance of unilaterally giving up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual General Assembly of the World Organization that North Korea had taken "significant congratulatory measures" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, breaking the nuclear laboratory, and promising not to increase the proliferation of nuclear technology and nuclear weapons.
"But we have not seen any similar reaction in the United States," he said.
“If there is no trust in the United States, we will have no confidence in our national security, and there is no way for us to unilaterally disarm on our part in such a situation.”
While Ri was describing North Korea's accusations against Washington's "strategic" approach to nuclear disarmament that would be rewarded for its slow action by North Korea, his remarks appeared to be significant because he did not unilaterally exclude nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang has done so in the past.
Ri noted a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work on "nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula" and when Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also refuted calls for tighter international sanctions on North Korea.
"America has insisted on "disarmament-first" and has raised the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve their objectives with compulsion, even against the declaration of "the end of the war"," Ri said.
"The idea that restrictions can put us on the ground is an ominous dream of those who don't know about us.
But the problem is that the continued ban deepens our distrust.”
There was no comment on the plan for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. head of state raised at the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister, instead, referred to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months: “If this issue of disarmament were not the United States, South Korea would not have been in such a stalemate.”
Still, Ri's tone of speech was dramatically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target the U.S. mainland with a North Korean rocket when "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a suicide "rocket man."
At the United Nations this year, Trump, last year, threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking the disarmament step, but said there was still a lot of work to be done and sanctions must continue until North Korea disarmed.
"If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter," Trump said on Wednesday.
China and Russia argued that Pyongyang should be rewarded for the actions taken by the UN Security Council
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Americans. The Security Council on Thursday said that: “The Security Council’s sanctions must continue to be effective until we realize fully fully verified disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously extended sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to stop funding Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile program.
Pompeo met with Ri at the UN General Assembly in Assemble, and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not good.
He said while leaving Pyongyang in July that some progress had been made, only a few hours before North Korea condemned him for "claiming like goons!"
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "similar measures."
He said the "relevant steps" that Kim was looking for were a security guarantee that Trump had given to Singapore and a security guarantee that he was moving towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking the course to get enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year is gearing up for all of its graduates to get more sleep to cope with the growing culture of night-sleeping "Ratzaga", a caffeine-fueled night-time study.
An academic has discovered that students at number one universities in the world are often confused about very basic issues about how to take care of themselves.
The course has been developed by Charles Sizzler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, which he believes is the first in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture about the impact sleep lack had on the education sector.
“At the end of it, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why am I told this so long, that my seniors came to me?’ ”
"Nobody ever told him about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told the Telegraph.
This course, which was launched for the first time this year, explains how the best sleep habits help students achieve academic and athletic performance, as well as what is necessary to improve their general health.
Paul Bariera, a psychiatrist professor at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's Department of Health Services, said the university had decided to launch the course after students were severely deprived of sleep this week.
The one-hour long course consists of several interrelated tasks.
A section contains images of a dorm room, where students will learn about the effects of caffeine and light by clicking on coffee cups, curtains, trainers, and books, and learn how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation and realize the importance of a bedtime routine.
In another category, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't change the behavior of the students immediately.
"But we believe they have a right to know - just as you decide to smoke, but also have a right to know its effects on health," Sisila added.
He said the culture of “staying awake all night” still exists, adding that sleep deprivation is a growing problem due to modern technology and the increasing pressure on students.
A student should be a 'secret weapon' to combat stress, fatigue, and anxiety to ensure you get enough good quality sleep, he said - even sleep deprivation makes the brain starve, making them constantly hungry."
Raymond So, 19, who studied chemical and physical biology in California, helped Professor Sisler design the course, also taking a class during his first year at Harvard last year.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to pursue a campus-wide course.
In the next step, she hopes that all postgraduate students will be requested to complete such a study program before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Sigilla recommended that students should consider setting up an alarm for when to go to bed as well as when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which may destroy your circadian rhythm, causing problems with falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Manger's goalless defeat to Gerard's champions.
Dolly Menger's goal saw the Rangers lose another road game due to Steven Gerrard's random 1-0 loss to Livingston.
After a 4-1 win at St. Johnston in February, the team looked to another win, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerard's second defeat as manager in 18 matches, taking him eight points away from the heartes at Ledbroke's premiership top.
Menga was hit seven minutes before the half-time, but the injured Rangers line-up never got to them.
Rangers are now down to sixth place, Livingston has risen to third place and trails Hibernian in goal difference.
And there may be more problems for rangers because Linesman Calam Spence had to be treated for head injuries for an object that was thrown off the edge of the road.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that made the Irons top in the semi-finals of the Batfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Levi 11 that took one point off the Harts last week and was supposed to be proud of the way his well-equipped team beat the opponent to the punch.
The Rangers may have dominated the ball possession, but Livingston did more with their ball.
Menger should have scored in just two minutes if he sent Scott Pittman for the first-ever Le-of-Allan McGregor goal, but the midfielder wasted his big chance.
Kegan got Craig Halkett, a long free-kick captain of Jacobs, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was only able to hit the ball in the back post.
The Rangers regained control but had more hope than they believed in playing in the final third.
Alfredo Morlos certainly felt that he should have received his penalty in the quarter-hour due to the clash between him and Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson dismissed Columbian's appeal.
Rangers could only target two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ebrox goalkeeper Liam Kelley was barely hit by Lasana Kulibali's head and Ovi Azaria's shot.
Livi's 34th minute opening goal may have been against the flow of the game, but no one can deny that they are the sole defenders of the game.
The Rangers failed to handle the deep set-piece of Jacobs again.
Scott Arfield did not respond because of the Deccan Galler Scott Robinson's ball slot, he kept his head cool to pick up the manga for general finishing.
Gerard took action in the break replacing Kulibli with Ryan Kent, and the change was almost instantaneous as the winger was in Morales, but the extraordinary Kelly moved him off the line to the block.
However, as Livingston visitors began to play exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, Lithgow and Halkett were sending the long ball after a long ball.
Holt's team could also advance to the final stage of their lead, but McGregor stood up to ruin Jacobs' efforts before heading to Lithgow Corner.
Thomson once again turned his back on the claim of Glenn Middleton, a substitutor of the rangers who demanded Let's Penalty.
Almanac: The inventor of the Gayger counter.
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today... on the day that future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Giger was born in Germany.
Giger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that eventually became known as the Giger Counter.
Since then, a core foundation of science, Gayger Counter has also become the cornerstone of a pop culture, starring seemingly-potential Kaupok scientist Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado:
Man: "What is this?"
Rogers: "It is used to detect radioactive minerals such as a gigagger counter, uranium.
When you give these earphones to the bride, you can hear the effects of the atoms given by the radiation between the minerals.”
Evans: "Does that say a lot of words?"
"Hans" Gaeger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
His discovery is still alive.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to detect rogue cells.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to detect and kill rogue cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to detect rogue cells as part of the treatment.
The procedure involves removing the immune cells from the patient and changing them in the lab.
Then they can "see" a protein common to many cancers and then re-enter.
An experimental vaccine has shown promising results with patients of different levels of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to detect rogue cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The procedure involves extracting immune cells from the patient, changing them to the laboratory so that they can "see" the normal proteins of many cancers called HER2, and then re-entering the cells.
Professor J. Barzaffski of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "increases the growth of a variety of cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer," explained Professor Barzoffsky.
It has also worked out a similar approach to treating leukemia to eliminate immune cells outside of patients and "learn how to target cancer cells."
Kanye West joins Pro-Trump debate in SNL after wearing a MAGA hat
It didn't go well
Kanye West was booed at the studio after a long performance during Saturday Night Live where he praised U.S. President Donald Trump, saying he would continue to hold the position in 2020.
After performing his third song of the night called Ghost Town, where he wore a Make America Great Cap, he denounced the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“Sometimes when I talk to a white person, they say: ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist!’”
Well, if I had been concerned about racism, I would have come out of America long ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a skit starring Matt Damon where the Hollywood star, Christine Blaze, joked about Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judicial Committee over Ford's claims of sexual assault.
Although it was not broadcast, West's scathing footage of comedian Chris Rock has been uploaded on social media.
It's not clear if the West has tried to make a mockery of the post.
West also complained to the audience that he had to face backstage problems with his head.
"They put me in the backseat.
He said, "Don't wear a hat."
They beat me up!
And then they said I'm in a sinking place," according to the Washington Examiner's source.
West added: “Do you want to see the place?” saying that he would read his own “Superman Cape, because that means you can’t tell me what to do. ” Do you want to see the world moving forward?
Try it with love."
His comments were booed at least twice from the audience, and SNL cast members were embarrassed, the Variety reported, where one person told the publication: “The whole studio had a pineapple silence.”
West was brought in as an alternative to singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West I love it makes a lot of people confused by the performance of the song by decorating it like a parietal bottle.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest souls: thank you for standing up against the evildoers.”
But talkshow presenter Karen Hunter tweeted that West was "what it was and she's absolutely awesome."
"But I chose not to reward anyone (buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") who is embracing and spreading harmful ideals for my community."
He is independent.
"And so are we," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he is now "officially known as Kanye West."
D is not the first artist to change his name and follow his path to DD, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffie and PDD.
Another contemporary rapper, Snoop Dogg, was named Snoop Leon and, of course, the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacked toxic masculinity or toxic masculinity.
Kit Harington is known for his combative role as Zone Snow in HBO's attacking medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor said about the stereotype of the Macho hero that playing such a role on the screen means giving young boys the idea that they have to be tough to get respect.
Speaking to Sunday Times Culture, he said he believed "something went wrong" and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who was recently married to his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie at the age of 31, admits she felt strongly about the problem.
"I feel very strongly, personally, at the moment - where are we going wrong in malehood?" he said.
"What did we teach men when they were growing up, that we are facing this problem now?"
Kit believes that television toxic masculinity may be partly responsible for the growth of its superhuman characters.
He said: "What are we learning?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that boys feel they have to follow this particular path in order to be men?
I think that's one of the biggest questions of the time - how can we change that?
"Because obviously there is something big wrong with young people."""
In the interview, he also admitted that he wouldn't make any Game of Thrones predictions or sequels when the series will be renewed next summer, saying he ended his life of 'warfield and horse'.
From November, Kit will be starring in Sam Shepard's remake of True West, a story about a film producer and his bandit brother.
The actor recently revealed that he considers his wife Rose as the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this show, so it's been a gift to my future family my life.
In the Rose Emmy Award-winning fantasy series, Igret played Kitt's character John Snow's lover.
The couple got married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China has reported a 14% growth in new cases.
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of HIV and AIDS cases.
There are more than 820,000 infected people in the country, health officials said.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, nearly 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases were due to sexual transmission, which has changed from the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection spreads quickly to different parts of China for blood circulation.
But the number of people infected with HIV has been reduced to almost zero this way, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000.
HIV infection through sex is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still considered prevalent.
Because of the country's conservative values, the study estimated that 70-90% of men have sex with men, who later marry women.
Infections of many diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaks of GOP senators' data, "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Republican Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff posted personal data of three Republican U.S. senators to lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat strongly claimed that these claims were being propagated by "ultra-right wing" scholars and websites.
"False, false, and more hateful lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information published includes the home address and phone number of U.S. Senators. Senators. Lindsey Graham, and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both Utter.
The information was published online on Thursday after an unidentified man posted on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Scholars and Redstate reported that the IP address identifying the source of the post was linked to the "Waters" office and revealed information about a member of the Waters staff, Hill reported.
"This baseless allegation is a complete lie and a perfect lie," Waters continued.
"Members of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these frauds and false accusations - were in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This baseless allegation is completely false and a perfect lie.”
Waters' statement quickly received criticism online, including former White House press secretary Ari Flescher.
"This denial is angry," Fleisser wrote.
"It shows that he has no inclination to become a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they don't get angry.
They should not be opponents.
They must not question the intention of the complainant.
They must be calm and serene."
Fletcher was comparing Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was seen as too angry by critics during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is seeking to oust Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"It's really big," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had "warned the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies" about the fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators will be revealed,” he continued, “and any member of my staff and all members will be legally held accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous.”
Johnny English Strikes Again Review - Weak Rowan Atkinson Spying
It's now traditional to see the significance of Brexit in any new film, including the British myth, and it seems to apply to the revival of the Johnny English action-comedy spoof franchise - which began with Johnny English in 2003 and returned to Johnny English's life in 2011.
Is it possible for us to see how much of a waste we have created as a nation?
At any rate, pop-eyed, rubber-faced disabled Johnny English has a license to create new things for the second time - his name more than anything else indicates that he is a broad comic creation designed for the cinema world of languages other than English.
He's certainly the dumbest secret representative who, despite the bizarre trend of smooth graffiti, has contributed a note to the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics in London, a dash of Mr. Bean and a dolp of the Chap.
He was originally based on Traveler and the man of international mystery Atkinson once starred in the forgotten Barclays TV ads, spreading chaos in consciousness.
There are one or two good moments in this latest Jee-Outing.
I liked to see Johnny English come to a helicopter while the rotor blades were hanging with a little helmet, dressed in medieval armor.
Atkinson's gift for physical humor is showing up, but the humor has been quite low-key and oddly exaggerated, especially the 007 and the "Serious" film brand like Mission Impossible now confidently suggests comedy as an element.
The joke seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English's bizarre accidents aren't as innovative and centered on Ben's personality as Atkinson's silent-cinema gag.
The topical basis of multi-years is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker penetrated Britain's most secretive web network of spying, to reveal the identities of all UK agents in the field, to frustrate the agent responsible - sadly a small role for Kevin Alden.
This is the last hope of a prime minister who is already suffering a complete meltdown of political opposition, is an illusory and bound figure: Emma Thompson has done her best with this semi-tresa-me character, but there is not much to do in the script.
His intelligence advisers told him that every active spy had been compromised, so he had to get someone out of retirement.
And that means babbling Johnny English, who is now employed as a school teacher in some twenty institutions, but teaches beyond the record how to be a disguised worker: here are some good jokes, as English offers the Rock-type Academy's school of detectives.
English returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and again reunited with his former long-suffering sidekick Bauer, starring Ben Miller.
Bao is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, the role of a jali-hookie-stick in which Vicky Pepperdine has been somewhat squandered.
So, after making a fatal mistake in Her Majesty's Secret Service, Batman and Robin returned to action and faced Olga Kurlenko's widowed woman Ophelia Boultova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously falling into the magic of the Carishmetric technology billionaire, who claims he will be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: Papi Jason Volta, starring Jack Lacy.
English and Bau started their far-reaching high-jink strange noises: they set fire to a flash French restaurant in Wetter's disguise; they began to smuggle themselves into Voltaire's luxurious boat; and the English created a pure chaos by trying to use the virtual reality headset to familiarize themselves with the interior of the Voltaire's home.
All the stops have certainly been drawn to the final stage, but as much as it's mesmerizing and boisterous, there's quite a bit of kids' TV on the whole thing.
A very average staff.
And like the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t have imagined: couldn’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that truly does justice to his talent?
Labour denies it plans to work four days a week on behalf of Britain but will get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a key plan that the British will see working four days a week - but getting paid for five days.
According to the report, the group wants the company's owners to share the money they save with an additional holiday of employees through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.
It will see employees enjoy a three-day holiday - but still carry the same pay home.
Sources said the concept would "fit" with the party's economic programme and there are plans to move the country on behalf of the workers.
The Trades Union Congress has approved a four-day week transfer as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It doesn’t happen overnight but a four-day workday is an aspiration that fits with the team’s approach to balance the economy in favor of the workers as well as the team’s overall industry.”
Not the first Labour Party to support such a concept, the Green Party promised a four-day working day during their 2017 general election campaign.
The desire is not currently being supported by the Labour Party as a whole, though.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day working day is not a party policy and is not being considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to express his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to give back power to "unknown directors" and "beneficiaries" in utility companies.
Shadow Chancellor's plan means current shareholders of water companies can't get their full share back because the labor government can "punish" some of the wrong doings.
She also confirmed plans to create a staffing and incorporating ownership fund on the company board to justify 10 percent of the employees of private sector companies, whose annual dividend stands at $500.
Lindsey Graham, tell John Kennedy "60 Minutes" if Kavanaugh's FBI investigation could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and the Bureau's findings have raised questions about whether any Republican senator could turn their backs on his or her.
In an interview aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Payley asked Republican Senators. John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham that the FBI could discover something that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"I asked to go to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
After the incident, I called him, the complaint came out, and I said, 'Did you do this?'
He was determined, unwavering.”
Graham's vote, of course, seems immutable.
"My mind has been made up about Brett Kavanaugh and a big quite important complaint will be needed to change that," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett strongly denies it," added Graham, referring to Christine Bliss Ford.
"And the name of which he said he could not be verified."
It is 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday will be the Global Citizen Festival in New York, an annual music event that stars have a great line-up of performance and an equally impressive mission; an end to world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people flocking to the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy acts such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Sean Mendes, but also raise awareness of the event's real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, described in 2012, is an expansion of the global poverty project, a group that expects poverty alleviation by increasing the number of people actively fighting internationally.
To get a free ticket for the event (if you are not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to do multiple tasks or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goals such as volunteer work, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or ending poverty.
But how successful has the global citizen been for 12 years to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people through a free concert a real move to persuade people to take action, or another case of so-called "climaticism" - where people think they're making a real difference by signing an online application or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, moving towards achieving various goals.
It says these measures have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion that will impact the lives of 2.22 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the team cited 390 commitments and announcements that began with its activities, including at least $10 billion already distributed or raised funds.
The group estimates that the protected fund has had a direct impact on about 649 million people worldwide so far.
Some of the key commitments include Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investor and implementer partnership committed to "help children grow their full potential," with more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens promising to provide Rwanda with 35 million to end malnutrition problems in the county.
"With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn malnutrition social injustice into a stepping stone to history," Tracy Woolman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, told the public during a power concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 steps were taken in the U.S. to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
One of the most frequently asked questions on its website is "What do you think we can do to end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and hard road - sometimes we will fall and fail."
But, like the great civil rights and anti-racism movement before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Gene Mony are among those who will perform at this year's event in New York, which will be performed by Deborah-Lee Fernes and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. may use naval forces to "block" Russia's energy exports - Home Secretary
Washington could "necessarily" seek its navy's asylum to prevent Russian fuel from coming to Middle Eastern countries, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinc has revealed, according to the Washington Examiner's description.
Zinke alleged that Russia's involvement in Syria - notably, where it is working at the invitation of a legitimate government - was an excuse to visit the new fuel market.
"I believe that the reason for their position in the Middle East is because they want to turn on electricity like the center of Eastern Europe, the southernmost part of Europe," he said.
And according to officials, there are ways and means to take action against it.
"The United States has the power with our navy to keep the seas open and, if necessary, to block their fuel so that it does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke was speaking to participants at an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that identifies the US as the "voice of fuel consumers."
He compared Washington's use to Russia and Iran, referring to the same in real terms.
"Referring to Russia's "remaining traces" including a fossil-fuel-based economy, "the economic alternatives to Iran and Russia are less related to the benefit and replacement of more fuels," he said.
The statement was made while the Trump administration was aiming to boost the export of much cheaper liquefied natural gas to European consumers in Europe instead of Russia.
Under its influence, US President Donald Trump himself, including a Trump administration official, is trying to bar Germany from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, according to Trump, it is being held in the hands of Berlin Moscow."
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which doubles the capacity of the existing pipeline, is ready to take it to 110 billion cubic meters - a fully financially affordable project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to the project is nothing more than financial and is an example of an unequal competition.
"In my belief, we agree that energy can't be used as a pressing tool and that consumers should have the ability to choose suppliers," Russian energy minister Alexander Novak said after an interview with U.S. energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has received a negative response from Germany, with Germany reaffirming its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry body, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"Following the recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Federation of German Industries (BDI) chief Dieter Kampf said, "We have major problems with the intervention of a third state in our energy supply."
Elizabeth Warren will "open up" to the candidacy for the 2020 presidential election, a Massachusetts senator said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would "seek" candidates for the post of president after an interim election.
Warren confirmed at a town hall in Hollyock, Massachusetts, that he was in competition.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes women attending the top positions," she said.
"After November 6, I will be vigorously contesting the presidency."
During his speech at the Warren Town Hall, President Donald Trump said Trump was "leading the country in the wrong direction."
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has come under criticism for Trump and Trump's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
"Of course we need a FBI investigation before we vote," Warren said in a tweet on Friday.
A study published on Thursday found that most of Warren's own voters did not think he should contest the 2020 election.
The Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey at the University of Suffolk found that 85 percent of Massachusetts' "potential" voters said they should not contest the Senate's vote.
Thirty-two percent supported the fight.
The survey found that former governor Deval Patrick's vote was more supportive of the fight, with 38 percent supporting a potential fight and 48% not.
Other high profile Democratic names likely to be discussed in the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden will make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin quotes track polyon PTSD at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enrolling in September.
He was arrested on Monday night for domestic violence.
"My own son who goes through what he goes through, I understand other families who can understand the consequences of what PTSD and our soldiers are going through," he told the audience at a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a "domestic elephant" and told his son and other war veterans that "they came back with little change, they came back strong, they came back to think about whether they had any respect for their fellows for what they did to the army and the air force and other members of the military."
He was arrested in Wasilah, Alaska on Monday, and according to police department spokesman Dan Bennett, a woman was charged with domestic violence, possession of weapons and drug abuse.
18 States, DC Supports New Refugee Policy Challenges
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are backing the legal challenge against the new U.S. policy that refuses to shelter victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
To support a asylum-seeker challenging the policy, representatives from 18 states and districts filed a friend-of-the-court brief in court in Washington on Friday, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case, which was filed in August against the American Civil Liberties Union federal policy, was not released.
He said his collaborator "and his violent gang-member boys" abused him, but U.S. officials rejected his asylum application on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
Attorneys from the states supporting Grace cited examples from El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, as a country facing widespread gang and domestic violence issues, from which a large number of asylum seekers came to the United States.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned the Immigration Appeals Board's 2014 decision to allow undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Attorney General Carl Resin of the District of Columbia said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "has ignored many decades of state, federal and international law."
The Friend-of-the-Court Brief states that "all asylum applications should be judged according to specific information and circumstances in accordance with this federal law, and such a ban violates the main purpose."
The attorneys in the statement also argued that the policy denying entry to immigrants is hurting the U.S. economy, as they are more likely to be entrepreneurs and that they "provide the necessary labor."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer provide shelter to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Those who have been forced to leave their country due to persecution or fear of membership or political opinion in a race, religion, nationality or particular social group can be given shelter," Sessions said in his policy announcement on June 11.
Refugees are never meant to solve all problems - even all the deadly problems - that people face every day around the world.
The death toll has doubled in the wake of efforts to rescue the survivors.
The situation was terrible for the survivors.
"Risa Kusuma, 35, at the Palu city shelter, asked her fever-stricken child to comfort her," it was very worrisome."
"An ambulance arrives every minute.
There is no clean water."
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes in an attempt to find what was found in the water.
Hundreds of people were injured and the crowd was overflowing in hospitals that were hit by a 7.5 magnitude quake.
Some of the injured, including Duo Harris, who fractured his back and shoulder bones, have been kept outside the Palu Army Hospital, undergoing treatment under the sky due to a strong subsequent tremor.
She cried when she was in a five-storey hotel room with her wife and daughter to talk about the shock of the earthquake.
"I didn't have time to save them.
I was stuck in the middle of a broken wall, I think," Harris told a media representative, adding that they had come to the city for a wedding ceremony.
"I can hear my wife screaming for help, then silence."
I don't know what happened to him or my kids.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "disgusting" by "propaganda advertising"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in the US daily, referring to the mutual benefits of the U.S.-China trade, China's U.S. ambassador has accused Beijing of using American press to campaign against him.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the paid supplement of the largest Chinese daily Des Mains Register in Iowa, and accused China of trying to interfere in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, denying the allegations.
Trump alleged that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US election, which US officials called a new attempt by Washington to pressure China.
It is natural that the foreign government will advertise to promote trade, but Beijing and Washington have now embarked on a trade war that has resulted in increased tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and U.S. experts say China's retaliatory tariffs in the early stages of the trade war were designed to harm exporters in states like Iowa who supported Trump's Republican Party.
The U.S. ambassador to China and former Iowa governor Terry Branstad, who is a major exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and traders.
Branstad said in an article in Sunday's Des Mines Register that China "has now doubled that barbarism with objective advertising in our own free press."
“The Chinese government is taking advantage of the immoralities of American freedom of speech and the history of the free press in promoting this propaganda by advertising payments to the Des Mines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, in the newsstand on Beijing's street, you will find limited anti-voices and you will not see the true reflection of the Chinese people's differences about China's worrying economic path, because the media is here at the behest of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that his writings "refused to print a major newspaper in China", although he did not mention the newspaper's name.
Republicans want to keep women away from voters ahead of midterms in the Kavanaugh debate, analysts warn
In the face of multiple allegations of sexual assault by many leading Republicans, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh has been sidelined and hidden, and analysts have warned that they will see adverse reactions from women, especially in the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiment around the issue has finally grown and it appears that most Republicans are already looking to go public with the vote.
In an article published Saturday, Grant Rihar, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse's Maxwell School, told The Hill, "They can't come back."
Rihar said he doubted whether the pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) would calm the angry voters at the last minute for an FBI investigation.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow and even in November," said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the Progressive Moveon group, according to the Washington DC newspaper.
Despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaze Ford, the Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee over Kavanaugh's nomination chanted "November is coming!" during the protests in the Senate hallway on Friday morning.
"Deliberate political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news site, "Democratic enthusiasm and inspiration will be the past.
"People say there's too much already; it's true.
But it could be even more, especially among the dominating female voters in the suburbs and among young voters aged 18 to 29, who often don’t vote because they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford's public testimony on allegations of sexual assault against a Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that there could be adverse consequences if Republicans proceed with approval.
"This has become a complex issue for the GOP," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just about whether the committee votes or the final vote or whether Kafanaf will be left behind, it's also about how the Republicans took it and how they used it," Proprioris USA Group, which supports Democrats in the vote, its director Guy Seychelles told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be a bit hesitant about who to trust in the wake of Ford's and Kavanaugh's testimony, with opinions weighing heavily on the latter.
A new survey by Yugov found that 41 percent of respondents believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believed Kavanaugh, of course, or possibly.
It also found that 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh had probably or certainly lied while taking his testimony, and only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations of Ford and Deborah Ramirez, at least another complainant, according to the Guardian report.
Ford testified to the Judiciary Committee last week that he was harassed by Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleged that Supreme Court Namini showed her genitals at a party while studying in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventors of the World Wide Web are planning to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project in the technology legend, Inrapt, is a company that will create the Berners-Leer open source platform Solid.
Solid's users have the right to choose where their data will be stored and what information will allow people to access.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrapt's real purpose was "world domination."
"We need to do that now," he said.
"This is a historic moment."
This app allows everyone to create a P&D or "personal online data store" using Solid's technology.
These may include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all in the same browser and get at the same time.
The unique thing about the personal online data store is that it completely depends on the user - who can access any type of information.
The company has named it "Personal Empowerment through Data."
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, Inrapt's idea will help bring resources, processes, and appropriate skills to get everyone's solids.
The company is currently a security platform purchased by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, with some contracted on-staff developers and a team of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using existing tools on Inrapt's website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team "are not talking about whether Facebook and Google will launch any complete changes where all their business models will be completely changed overnight."
"We don't ask for permission from them."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrapt's "purpose is to provide commercial fuel and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on solids."
In 1994, Berners-Lee radically changed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has emerged as a strong voice in the net neutrality debate.
Berners-Lee will also be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm optimistic about the future of the web," said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: Celebrating the Victoria Cross Clarice of the First World War
Adi celebrated the Centenary of the City of Adi, the only priest in the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross during World War I as a warrior.
Lt. Col. The Rev. Bernard van won the award on 29 September 1918 during the invasion of Belenglis and Lehancott.
However, he was killed four days later by a assailant and he never knew that he had received the highest British military honor.
Two of his grandsons unveiled the memorial at a parade in Rusden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was "extraordinary significance" that the monument was being unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's death.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van "led his battalion through the thick fog and heavy shelling of the field and machine guns" during the de Saint-Quantin Canal Per<0xC3><0xB3>n.
He then ran to the firing line and led the line with "maximum courage" just by singing a field song and punching three enemies.
On October 4, 1918, Lt. Col. Van was killed by a German attacker - just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions were “something I could never have done and which is tremendously respectful.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Van Kuchkowz, gave the wreath, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
"I feel very honored to be part of the parade," said Michael Van, adding, "a true heroic hero is being displayed in the support of a lot of people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch the 206 Belotto, but instead they got the Peppa Pig.
Imagine that you've been up all night to watch a great bettor 206 and the main event wasn't shown.
The original card of the bill received from San Jose contained 13 fights, including six, and was shown live throughout the night on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6 a.m., while Gerard Moussi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, the coverage changed to Peppa Pig and shocked the UK audience.
They woke up early in the morning, and some people were angry.
A fan on Twitter described the conversion of children's cartoons as "a kind of dirty joke."
"As per government rules, it is not appropriate to show such shows at 6 am because they were forced to change the children's cartoons," said Dave Schwarz, senior vice president of Belto.
"Papa the pig, yes."
Scott Cocker, president of the Belatore Association, said he would work on preparing a schedule for future UK visitors.
"Maybe we can fix it during the replay," Cocker said.
"But now we can't do it until Sunday morning, and we can't do it until Monday."
But we are working on it.
Trust me, when it was switched on, a lot of messages came from time to time and they weren't very friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it might be a technical error.
But no, it was a government issue.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We're going to cut it down to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - the opposite has happened in an attempt to overdo the fans.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Dessert Island Disc: Tom Daly suffers from "innocentness" due to sex.
Olympic diver Tom Daly says he was suffering from depression when he was growing up - but that inspired him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't go to secondary school until he realized that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island disc presented by Lauren Lavern, she said she spoke about gay rights in giving "hope" to others.
He also said that after the birth of the child, his thinking about winning the Olympics has decreased.
Christy Young, a regular presenter for the long-standing event, took several months off due to illness.
Appearing as a social dissident at Lavern's first event, Daly said he felt "smaller" than everyone else, because "the choice of boys and girls was not socially acceptable."
He said: “To this day, it remains real to feel that small and isolated that has given me the strength and determination to succeed.”
She said she wanted to prove herself as "something" so that everyone would know about her sexuality so that she wouldn't be disappointed.
The two-time Olympic bronze-medallist has become an LGBT campaigner and has used his presence to appeal to more countries to recognize homosexuality at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia.
He said that he had opened his mouth, because he considered himself lucky to live in public without complications and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion talks about falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lans Black, whom he met in 2013 - "surprised me."
Daly married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than her. He said age gap was not a problem.
"When you face so much at such a young age," he said, "when he first went to the Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later."
The couple gave birth to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily in June, and Daley said his "whole outlook" had changed.
“If you asked me last year, I would say ‘I have to win a gold medal’.
"There's something more important than the Olympic gold medal.
"Robbie is my Olympic gold medalist."
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at the age of 40.
Daley said his father never admitted that he was going to die and that he finally asked if his ticket for London 2012 had been confirmed - because he wanted to be in the first row.
“I never even said ‘you won’t be there to sit in the first row’,” he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and until he gave up his last breath and died and I didn't confess that he was invincible," she said.
The following year, Daly participated in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"It's been my dream all my life - to dive into the Olympics in front of my audience, there's nothing better," he said.
It also inspired her choice of her first song - Heather Small's Proud - which resonated with her in preparation for the Olympics and which still gnaws at her.

Michaelson, who is in off-form, will sit on the bench at Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record in his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he will have to return to form if he doesn't want to make it to the unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who has played in this biennial event for a record 12 times, had to sit on the bench on Saturday at Foreball and Foursome instead of Captain Jim Furick.
Instead of being at the center of the halcyon, which he used to play in the United States, this five-time major winner has spent the day working for the cheerleaders and busy renovating his own game in the range.
While not always comfortable among the drivers at the top of the career, this 48-year-old is not suitable for the Tight Le Golf National Course, where the taller raffle often disturbs the taller shot.
And if the course itself isn't bad news enough, Michalson, in the No. 9 match, is facing British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has won four of their matches this week by pairing up with Rookie Tommy Fleetwood.
If Americans, who are down four points at the start of 12 singles matches, can start well, Michelson's match can prove to be important.
Frank had a lot of confidence in him, but he didn't have much to say.
"Today, he's fully understood his mistake, laid his hand on my shoulder and said that he's ready for tomorrow," said Furick.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's been a big part of the team and he's done a lot this week.
I didn't expect him to play two games.
I expected more, but that's what happened and that's how we thought to move forward.
He wants to get on the field, just like everyone else."
In Sunday's match, Michaelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record of most riders playing in the Cup.
It could end up in a rider's cup career that doesn't even go with his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven halfs, although Furrick said his presence brightened the team.
"He's a funny guy, he's funny, he's smart, he likes to throw people, he's like being in the team room and he's a great guy," he said.
"I think the new players enjoyed playing with him a lot, too, which is a great thing to see this week.
He gives more than just a game."
Europe captain Thomas Bjorn knows that big leads can also disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that even if the riders with the older lead drop to the singles on the last day of the Cup, there may be an uncomfortable situation.
Den made his debut in 1997 in Valderam, where the Savvy Ballesteros-led side won five points to the Americans, but won the finish line in only the narrowest margin, somehow, at 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderam; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderam, where we won, but only by a nominal margin," said Bjorn in the film, winning 5-3 in class at Le Golf National on Friday and yesterday, leading 10-6.
"History will show me and the team that it's not over yet.
Let's get excited tomorrow.
Get on the field and do the right thing.
It doesn't end until the board is finished.
We have a goal, that is to try and win the trophy, and that's what our bird's eye will have.
I've always said that I look at 12 of my team players, but we're also very aware of who's on the other side - the best player in the world."
"I'm happy with the work our players have done on the tough golf course. "I'll never be super-confident about it.
Tomorrow is a different battle.
Tomorrow will be a personal performance, and that's a different thing.
It's great to be with a partner when all goes well, but when you're alone on the field, your abilities as a golfer are thoroughly tested.
This message needs to reach out to all the players, who will have to give the best tomorrow.
This time, you have to leave your partner and get the best out of it."
In contrast to Bjorn, opponents Jim Furick will keep an eye on the players who have played as a team to play better in person, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have scored three points out of four points.
As part of the "Medina Miracles" in Europe and the winning team in Brooklyn, Furrick himself experienced dramatic change on the last day.
"I remember every word of it," he said when asked about how captain Ben Crans had inspired his players before he stepped down on the last day of 1999.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you'll want to get rid of starting as fast as Brooklyn and Medina.
When the game hits on one side, there is a lot of pressure on the middle-side matches.
"We're going to make the line-up according to that, and we're going to put the boys off as we thought, actually, we're going to do some magic tomorrow."
Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter have been given the task of leading Thomas against top-order Europeans.
"I have arranged this team in this order, because I think it will cover everything," Bjorn said of his singles selection.
Germany's new warships re-opened
According to local media reports, T was scheduled to be launched in 2014 with the newest team of the German Navy to replace the previous Cold War-era warships, but it won't be until at least next year due to faulty systems and snobbing costs.
The new Baden-Württemberg-class frigate's first ship "Rhineland-False" has been suspended until the first half of 2019, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project is in trouble due to post-delivery issues.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigate.
They are said to have powerful cannons, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, such as reducated radars, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include a long maintenance period - it will be possible to deploy new frigates for a maximum of two years away from the country's port.
However, the continued delay means that the state-of-the-art warships - which are supposed to help Germany show energy abroad - will become obsolete by the time it goes down in the water, news from Die Jet.
The unfortunate F-125 frigate came to the headlines last year, when the German Navy formally refused to launch the ship and sent it back to Hamburg's Bloom and Vos Shipyard.
This is the first time a ship has been sent back to the shipbuilder after shipping.
Very little is known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of important "software and hardware errors" that would make the warship unmanageable.
The mounds of the software are particularly important, as Baden-Württemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - half of the manpower of the old Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it was observed that the ship was overly heavy which would reduce its performance and create obstacles in the way of adding future upgrades to the Navy.
The 7,000-tonne "Rhineland-Pulz" is thought to be twice as heavy as the same class of ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the training of crews, is also becoming a problem.
From <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion at the initial level, surprisingly reached <0xC2><0xA3>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
In the wake of Germany's recent warning of the shrinking of naval power, new frigates have become more important.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bertels, the head of the German parliament's defense committee, acknowledged that the Navy was "running out its appropriate ship of deployment."
The official said the problem had widened over time, as no replaceable ships were brought to the old ones that had been cancelled.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class ships were able to join the Navy.
Listening to the National Trust's Secret Life of Bats
New research is being conducted in an estate in the Scottish Hills to find out how bats use groundnuts in search of food.
The findings are expected to shed new light on the behavior of this unique flying mammal and help with future conservation activities.
Scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will continue their research on the common and soprano pups, as well as the Dobenton bats at the Inaugurative Garden of Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be set up at important places around the area to track the activity of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct ongoing surveys using portable detectors.
All recordings will be analysed by the specialist to determine the frequency of bat calls and to take a look at what species are doing.
A landscape map and report will then be created to create a detailed landscape-scale image of their behavior.
The NTS' nature conservation consultant hopes to give Rob the results that will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of grasslands and how to protect the forest for bats and other related species.
Over the last century, the number of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has decreased significantly.
They are at risk for building and developmental work that damages their sleeping space and habitat.
Wind-based turbines and lighting can also cause hazards, such as from some chemicals in flypapers and building materials, as well as from attacks on pet cats.
The mouse is not blind.
However, their ears are more effective than their eyes when it comes to hunting at night due to hunting habits.
They use an advanced echo-location technique to identify hazards and obstacles in the flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, has given importance to bats.
There are ten trained specialists who regularly conduct surveys, visit the place of sleep, and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The company has also set up Scotland's first and only dedicated bat conservation sites in the Three Estates of Dumfries and Gallo, where eight of Scotland's ten bat species live.
Estate manager David Thompson said the estate is an ideal location for bats.
"There's a good area for three bats," he said.
"There are old buildings, there are many old trees, and all have good habitats.
But much more about bats is still unknown, so the work we do here and in other places will help us understand more about what they need to survive."
He stressed the importance of knowing the presence of bats before maintaining the property, as it could inadvertently destroy 400 female and child bats, and wipe out the entire local bat numbers.
It is illegal to kill, harass or disturb bats and destroy their habitat.
The Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, Elizabeth Ferrell, has encouraged the public to help.
He said: “We still have a lot to learn about bats and we don’t know much about how many species live.”
Ronaldo has denied rape charges and lawyers are preparing to file a lawsuit against the German newspaper.
Calling the rape allegations brought against him as "fake news", he said that people "want to increase their identity" by naming him.
Her lawyers are ready to file a lawsuit against German news magazine Der Spiegel, who has publicly made the allegation public.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward have been accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mawrga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He is accused of giving him $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, according to a report released on Friday.
Ronaldo, 33, described the report as "fake news" while talking to his 142 million followers on his Instagram live video hours after the claim came to light.
"No, no, no, no, no.
"What they said today is false news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said on camera.
"They want to use my name.
It's a common thing.
They want to be famous, but that's part of life.
I'm a happy guy and everything is going well," the player added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to file a lawsuit against Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they call an "unacceptable report to be taken as suspicious in terms of privacy."
Lawyer Christian Shertz said the player would have to seek compensation "for moral damage in accordance with the importance of violence, which is perhaps one of the most serious abuses of personal rights in recent times."
The alleged incident took place in a suite of the Pams Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
According to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada, Ronaldo and Mayorga went to the player's home after meeting him at a nightclub where he was sexually assaulted.
Myerga claimed that Ronaldo pleaded after the incident and told her that he was disappointed for "99 percent" "good people", "one percent."
The document claims that Ronaldo has confirmed that he has had sexual intercourse, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claimed that he went to the police and took pictures of his injuries to the hospital, but later agreed to a settlement outside the court, as he was "feared of retribution" and "feared of being humiliated in public."
The 34-year-old said she is now seeking to revive the settlement as she is mentally disturbed by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was in the middle of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the crime and joined Italy's famous club Juve in a $100 million deal this summer.
Brexit: UK 'will regret forever' losing position as carmaker
Commerce Minister Greg Clark said the UK would "forever regret" if it lost its position as the world's first car maker after Brexit.
He added that it was "shocking" that the UK Toyota told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, they would temporarily stop production at their factory in Bernston near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker has said that people could lose their jobs due to the delay in the border crossing if Brexit is done without a deal.
Barnston's factory, which manufactures Toyota Oris and Avenis, produced about 150,000 cars last year, about 90 percent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our factory may stop,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota Managing Director at Bernstein.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concerns about leaving the European Union without a deal on how cross-border trade will be conducted.
For example, BMW said it would shut down its mini plant in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concern that car manufacturers say is the risk of supply chains in case of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line runs on a "just-in-time" basis, for both the UK and the EU, the shipments come in from suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be disruptions at the border, which could lead to delays in supply and a crisis of control, like the trade body said.
The company said it was not possible to keep more than a day's worth of inventory in the Toyota Derbyshire plant, which could lead to the closure of production.
Mr Clarke said Theresa May's checkers plan for a future relationship with the EU was "appropriately formulated to avoid such checks on the border."
“We need a deal. We want to make the best deal that will not only sustain success, but also make it possible to enjoy the prospect of future improvements,” he said on BBC Radio 4 today.
"Not only Toyota, but other manufacturers are also proving that it is very important to continue the successful system of supply chain."
Toyota is unable to say how long production will be shut down, but they have warned that additional costs over the long term will reduce the factory's competitiveness and could result in many jobs being lost.
Peter Suvalaris, who has been working at the unit for 24 years in Bernston, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “Once these things are gone in my experience, they don’t come back.”
A government spokesman said: “We need to have a specific and credible plan for the future relationship with the EU.”
The White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed.
The White House said on Sunday that a high-level meeting with Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "withdrawn one more week" amid tensions over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosstein has overseen the work of Robert Mueller, a special counsel investigating Russia's interference in the election, the links between Trump's aide and Russia, and the possible obstruction of the president's trial.
Washington has been rattled over the past few months over whether Trump will sack the deputy attorney general and question Mueller's independence through it.
Earlier this month, the New York Times discussed the use of secret mics to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has denied the report.
On Monday, he was reported to have gone to the White House in the wake of a report he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, when Trump was in the United Nations office in New York.
Trump said he "wouldn't like" Rosstein to be fired, but the meeting was postponed to avoid hearings by both Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of sexual misconduct against him.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's allegations, which further delayed the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Regarding his meeting with Rosstein, he said: "There is no fixed date, it could happen this week, it could be delayed by another week for all the other current Supreme Court issues."
"I've always wanted to talk to the media."
Some journalists will oppose the statement, with Sanders not making any further press briefings at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked the reason.
Sanders said that the reason not to keep the briefing was not for "showing people" to journalists, though he said: "I don't deny that they've done a thing to show people."
He also called for an increase in direct contact between Trump and the press.
“The current president holds more questions than any previous president,” he said without citing any evidence: “We have judged that number.”
"But if the media gets a chance to directly question the president of the United States, it's better to talk to me than talk to me," Sanders said.
We try very hard to do this, and over the last few weeks you have seen us do it, and it's going to be a place to talk directly to the President of the United States instead of a press briefing."
Trump regularly receives questions when he leaves the White House or attends opening sessions or press conferences with prominent guests.
There is very little press conference.
This week in New York, the president probably showed why, doing unplanned work and sometimes having a bizarre presence in front of the journalist's team.
Health Minister NHS Scotland writes letter to EU workers in Scotland over fears of Brexit
The health minister thanked EU workers working at the NHS in Scotland and expressed his willingness to stay in the post-Brexit period.
Jean Freeman sent a letter to MSP less than six months before leaving the EU.
The Scottish government has already promised EU citizens to meet the cost of the set-up status application to work in the country's government services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: Talks between the UK and the EU on Brexit continue throughout the summer, which is expected to have consequences this autumn.
However, the UK government is also preparing for a possible no-deal situation.
I know you all are going through a difficult time.
For this reason, I would like to remind you once again how valuable to me is the contribution of every member of the staff irrespective of their nationality.
colleagues from across the European Union and beyond have come up with valuable experiences and skills that have strengthened and improved health care and benefitted patients and our communities.
Scotland is your own country and we want you to stay here."
Christian's emergency surgery after being hit in the head
Tennessee's Mike Organ said the Tennessee State Tigers' linebacker Christian Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after being hit in the head in a 31-27 defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday.
The head coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reid, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the half-time.
"He's on the sideline and he's kind of messed up," Reid said.
The trainers and medical staff gave him oxygen on the sideline and he was later brought back for further testing.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Vanderbilt was out of surgery at the medical center this time.
Harris also said that "no details of the type/type of injury are known yet" and that Tennessee is trying to find out when the state hit.
A second-year student wearing a red shirt after moving from Illinois is playing the first season with Ebercrombie, Tennessee State.
He had five total tackles on Saturday before coming out of the game, with a total of 18 tackles this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay more stamp duty when buying a property in the UK.
Under the Tory plan, foreign buyers will have to pay more stamp duty when they buy new properties in the UK and the extra money will be spent on helping the homeless.
The move will ease the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters.
The increase in stamp duty will be applicable to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury expects to raise revenues by up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to support the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have to pay more stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK - and this extra money will be spent on helping the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will ease the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters as it aims to provide housing at a more affordable price and target high-income earners.
The stamp duty increase will apply to individuals and organizations that do not pay taxes in the UK, and additional funding will be needed to help the homeless.
Surcharges - which, in addition to the current stamp duty, were imposed at a higher rate in a second home and a rented house two years ago, could be more than three percent.
The Treasury expects to raise revenues by up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of London's newly created total assets are purchased by residents outside the UK, for which prices have risen and first housing has made the situation more difficult for buyers.
Most of the elite regions of the country - especially the capital - are becoming "unknown cities" in the crowd of foreign buyers who spend most of the time abroad.
The new policy comes weeks after a call for a reduction in the Boris Johnson stamp duty to help the younger generation buy their first home.
She has accused major construction companies of increasing property prices by not buying land, and urged Ms May to cancel the affordable housing quota to solve Britain's "residence problem."
Mr. Corbyn announced an interesting series of housing reform proposals, including rent control and an end to "no-fault" evictions.
He wants to give the council more power to build a new house.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my prime ministership to restoring the British dream - which is that life should be better for everyone of the new generation.
This means that the housing market is broken down.
The UK will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life.
However, it may not be right that foreign and foreign non-governmental entities that do not live in the UK will buy property as easily as hard-working British residents.
Many people dream of owning a house, and the problem of homelessness remains very real.
Jack Ross: “My ultimate dream is to take over Scotland.”
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "final ambition" is to become Scotland's manager someday.
This 42-year-old Scottish resident, currently enjoying the challenge of restoring the Northeastern club, who are now third in the league one, three points behind the first team.
St. Maarten was brought back to the Scottish Premiership last season and moved to the Stadium of Light this summer.
"I wanted to play for the country as a player.
I was getting a B-cap and so far," Ross told the BBC Sports Scotland.
"But I grew up watching Scotland's game at Hampden with my father as a child and it always pulls me back.
This opportunity can come only if I succeed in running the club."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Ryan Keane, Gus Poet and Paulo de Cano.
The former Aloy Athletic boss said he did not feel disappointed by rejecting the offer of established names for big clubs such as Burnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The measure of success for me at the moment will be 'Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'
"Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it is undoubtedly worthy of the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not that easy to get there, but I’ll probably see myself as successful if I can bring the club back there.”
Ross's managerial life span is currently only three years after having 15 months as an assistant boss at Dumbarton and Hart's coaching staff.
He then helped Aluya recover from the downfall to the third level and convert St. Mirren from the doorstep of the downfall to the championship title winner the following season.
And Ross said he's now feeling more comfortable here than his academic career at Clyde, Hartlpool, Falcarc, St. Mirren and Hamilton.
“It was probably a real milestone,” he recalled, recalling that Aloy took charge.
"I really believed that management is better for me than sports.
It sounds strange because I've done it right, lived a whole life from it, and enjoyed some success.
But it's hard to play
You have to go through a lot every week.
I still feel the same about the pressure at work, but the management seems to be right.
I've always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it, it's the most comfortable thing on my own skin in my entire adult life."

According to the survey, at 5.30 pm on Saturday is the most ideal for pints.
Summer heatwaves have increased crowds in Britain's smoked pubs, but restaurants have put pressure on the chain.
Sales of pubs and bars rose by 2.7 percent in July - but restaurant finance collections fell by 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, CGA's business consultant company, who compiled the figures, said: "The unforeseen sunshine and England's unanticipated long participation in the World Cup would mean the same trend will continue in July as in June last year, when pub sales grew 2.8 percent and restaurant sales fell.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant business in June was even worse in July.
The main pubs and bars of the drink have done very well so far, and the sales of restaurants have been as bad.
Food major pubs are also suffering from heat dissipation, but did not sell them down like restaurants.
It's like people are going out for a drink.
Sales of drinks in all pubs and bars rose 6.6 per cent this month, with food sales down three per cent.”
Paul Newman of Retirement and Hospitality Analyst RSM said: "The end of April trend is still continuing.
The weather and large social or sporting events have the most impact on sales outside the home market.
It's no surprise that restaurant groups will be in a difficult situation, but this 4.8 percent drop on sales each year will be particularly painful.
For food major operators, the long and hot summer may not come at a bad time, and the soft weather in August will tell time if it will bring some relief."
In July, total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, were up 2.7 percent, reflecting a decline in sales at brand roll-out.
Coffear Pitch Tracker Industry Sales Monitor in the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector has collected and analyzed performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 million, and it's established industry standards.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
The study revealed that one in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students showed an increase in the number of "nookle insta" pages.
There have been reports that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty-one percent of students say they have a "main" account to show their parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - are creating a social media account hidden from adults.
According to a survey of 20,000 secondary school students, the site Instagram - a photo sharing site - has shown a trend of rapid growth.
The news has raised concerns that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty-one percent of students said they had a transparent "main" account to show their parents, as well as a hidden one.
A mother, who saw the hidden site of her 13-year-old daughter, saw a teenager calling others "rape me."
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headteachers Conference (HMC) found that between 11 and 18 years of age, 40 percent had two profiles, half of whom admitted to having a secret account.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create places online that parents and teachers can’t find.”
Elidh Doyle will be the voice for the Scottish Athletics Board.
At the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body, Elidh Doyle has been elected a member of the Scottish Athletics Board as an executive director.
Doyle, Scotland's most successful track and field athlete and chairman, Ian BT, described the move as a great opportunity for sports managers to benefit from his extensive experience at the international level over the past decade.
"Elizabeth has a lot of respect across the Scottish, UK and world athletics community, and we are confident that bringing him to Scotland's athletics board will greatly benefit," he said.
Doyle said: “I’m interested in working as a voice for athletes and I’m hopeful that I can really help Scotland’s sport and take it forward.”
This American, who won four Olympic golds in Atlanta in 1996 with 200 metres and 400 metres, and is now a regular BBC scholar, has stopped walking after a strong transitional ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
Time will tell how well I'll be able to recover.
It was hard work, but now I've learned to walk again and again.

The Internet Is Differing Than Mothers and Cows in Breast Pump Ads
A breast pump company has divided the internet's opinion with an advertisement that compares baby mothers to milking cows.
At the inauguration of what is called "the world's first noiseless breast pump," consumer technology company LV has released a funny music video advertisement to show the freedom that the new pump gives to modern mothers.
The four true mothers are dancing with a song running a hare-filled cow, which lyrics include: "Yes, I bless my own milk, but I don't have a tail" and "If anyone sees it, these are no cattle buns, these are my breasts."
The chorus continues: “Pump, pump, feed the children, pump, feed the milk of my girlfriends.”
However, the ad, which has been released on the company's Facebook page, has created controversy online.
The video received mixed response from the audience in 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. Many say it highlights the "fear" of the dairy industry.
"The use of cow in advertising of this product is a very bad decision.
To produce milk, like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth, the difference is that within a few days of birth, their babies are stolen from them," one wrote.

Another commented: "It's obviously disappointing for both mother and child.
But why should they not be used in the advertising of breast pumps for mothers who care for their children?"
Another said: "Extremely uncomfortable advertising."
Others stand next to the ad, with a woman confessing that the song seemed to be her "pleasant."
"I think it's a great idea.
If I had a baby, I would have a baby too.
She looks like a cow when she's pumping.
It's a bit crazy, but I'm pretty good at it.
"It's an innovative product," one wrote.
Another commented: "It's a juicy ad aimed at mothers who (often at their workplace or in the toilet) pump up and think of themselves as "crazy."
This ad doesn’t praise or criticize the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women say they all danced with the pump hidden in their bra.
The ad is based on the idea that many women feel like a cow while pumping their breasts.
Although the LV pump is completely noiseless, it does not have its or tube and fits nicely into the nursing bra, which gives women the freedom to walk, keep the baby in the lap and even get out during the pumping.
Anna Ballerin, Mother's Partner and ECD said: "LV pumps are a revolutionary product that should start bravely and vigorously.
Drawing parallel images of women and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and all its challenges in the spotlight, revealing the incredible feeling of release that the new pump will bring in an entertaining and related way.
The LV pump is not in the news for the first time.
In London Fashion Week, a mother of two children uses this product to walk the catwalk for designer Marta Zakuboowski.
Hundreds of migrant children have been taken to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of detained migrant children has increased, although the monthly border crossing remains relatively unchanged, as the Trump administration's strict rules and policies have made it more difficult to keep children to their sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves are afraid to lose the possibility of living in their own country by claiming immigrants and children without papers.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to submit fingerprints, and the information would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs enforcement official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of orphaned children.
The agency later said that 70 percent of those arrested had no past criminal history.
"About 80 per cent of the sponsor's family members are in the country illegally and a large part of them are violators.
So we're continuing to look for them," said Nister Albens.
In an effort to bring children back to society more quickly, officials introduced some new rules that include having to appear in court within a month of their detention, which was 60 days earlier, according to asylum seekers.
Many of them will appear before the immigration judge through video conference calls rather than in person during their trial for legal status.
Those who are considered ineligible for relief will be promptly evicted.
According to shelter staff and reports released from the system in recent months, the more days children are in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent incidents or attempts to escape.
Supporters say these concerns are more acute in large centres such as Toronto, where children are more likely to be overlooked, due to their size.
They also said that the trauma could be multiplied by many if the children were not mentally ready or if they were moved to the center without enough time to say goodbye to friends so they were already suffering.
The U.S., French and Turkish "captive forces" have been asked to leave Syria immediately.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Molaym called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country has been at war for eight years.
Moyalem, who is at the same time the country's deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are illegally on the ground in the country on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "we will take appropriate measures."
"They have to leave now," he said.
Moyalem stressed that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been forced to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to fight "until all Syrian territory is cleared" against both terrorists and "illegal foreign presence."
There are about 2,000 US troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
When asked about the refugees, Moalem said the situation was conducive for them to return and he blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that prompted refugees to stay away.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help with this repatriation," he said.
"They're dealing with a human problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive any reconstruction assistance until a political deal is reached to end the war between Assad and the opposition.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to build a buffer zone at the last major rebel base in Idlib provides an opportunity to move forward through political negotiations.
The Russia-Turkish deal has prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the area, where three million people live.
However, Moyalem insists that the agreement has a "clear timeline" and hopes that the military action will work against jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who will be "destroyed."
United Nations Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meeting of a new committee comprising members of the government and opposition to draft post-war constitutions and pave the way for elections.
Moyalem said the Syrian government's participation in the committee should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution," and warned against undue interference.
Why Trump won the second round
In this argument, Trump will win the 2020 re-election, as a large number of liberals likely expect his presidency to end prematurely due to impeachment and scandal.
It's going to be "the most dramatic end of any president."
So far, there is no sign of changing the audience's opinion.
Since 2014, the prime-time rating on CNN has more than doubled to about 1.05 million, and in the case of MSNBC it has almost tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News' average prime-time audience has grown from 1.7 million last year to about 2.4 million, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Mado Show" tops the ratings with about 3.5 million viewers on the big news night.
About a cabinet secretary who became president after the Capitol was destroyed in an attack, ABC Drama "Dedicated Survivor" director Neil Berr said, "It's a fire that's attracting people, because it's beyond our comprehension."
There is another theory behind the words of veteran comedy writer Neil Scovel and "Just the Fanny Parts: Some Hidden Hard Truths at the Hollywood Boys Club."
He recalled a taxi trip before the 2016 election.
The driver asked him if he was voting for Trump.
Why? he asked.
"Because she's funny," Ms. Scowell told me.
This game also has some entertainment value.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the things that emerge from Washington can determine the future of Roe Five. Wait for whether immigrant families can reunite and what happens to the global economy.
Turnover is a luxury that is only available to the most privileged audiences.
And in spite of that, a conscious citizen will go beyond the comprehension of when you see a panel of experts arguing for six hours about Bob Woodward’s use of “deep background” for his “Fire” book, and Paul Manafort’s $15,000 camel-to-peer bomb jacket (the Washington Post says about “Hubris with thicker details”) and Mr Trump’s Uttley.
I don't think I'll ever see Super Mario again.
Regarding the Trump show's day-to-day rotational cast and day-to-day plot change (with the fight with the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un), Chief Executive of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and producer of "Pon Stars" Brent Montgomery said, "Like some of the reality show he's doing, every night he's doing something funny."

When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, there were 80 sunny weather outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was still sitting at home recording CNN to watch MSNBC.
He was unable to find himself in the face of Brett Kavanaugh's Senate Judiciary Committee and the fate of the Supreme Court hanging on him.
"I remember when we used to do great shows in sunny days and people would say, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it would be a joke, but it's real."

In the mid-term elections, money was pouring in like floodwaters.
It's no surprise that money is flying in Pennsylvania's 17th vote, as two candidates are fighting for a single seat in the congressional district's reorganization.
The recently refurbished downtown Pittsburgh District Pitts are bringing Democratic Representative Conor Lamb to the fight - who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is fighting against Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the 12th District of Old Pennsylvania, much of which is part of the new 17th District.
In January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the old districts were constitutionally inaccurately formatted in favor of Republicans, causing the map to be redrawn.
The fight in the new 17th District has involved a competition between the main parties' finance branch, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb made his debut in March after winning a narrow victory in a widely-publicized special election in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat has been held by Republicans for more than a decade, with President Donald Trump winning 20 points in the district.
The Democrats are pushing the Democrats a little bit.
El Salvador sentenced to death for supporting U.S.
Diplomats have noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, retreating a little from Washington.
Mr Trump held a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama, but later the partners removed the Trump Organization's director team.
State Department spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month that "the recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan" led the department officials to return American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama.
But the punishment was announced only against El Salvador, who received nearly $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017 in the field of drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed punishment, which included a cut in financial aid and a certain visa ban, could have been painful for the Central American country due to its high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meeting progressed, North American and Central American officials suspended a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity as a measure to prevent the influx of immigrants to the U.S. like last year.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made it clear they wanted to hold the conference, effectively ending El Salvador's chances of a conviction.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence will address the conference, which is scheduled to be held in mid-October, so that the administration will deliver a message of import.
And American envoys from the three countries quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new strong message or punishment from Washington.
Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the statement made by three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal affairs on the condition of anonymity.
His statement was confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration and he also refused to divulge his name.

Robert Mueller's special report on the possible obstruction of Mr. Trump in law, which now has enough evidence in public records.
Mr Mueller's investigation into whether Mr Trump had any links with Russia during the election is being turned around.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to take his responsibilities, just as he is preparing to go back in front of voters and eventually with his colleagues to the jury.
There are many if-and-ifs, and I'm not going to say that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, or his European complement.
How long this dispute will last will be the fate of the inhabitants of our two shores of the Atlantic.
In 1938, German officials "couped" against Hitler, unless the West stopped him and stood beside the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed, and we have had the opportunity to avoid many years of killings.
The course of history often takes such a turn, and in it, the overwhelming pace of democracy is sometimes accelerated, sometimes delayed.
There have been similar developments in American history as well.
What should we do if Mr. Trump sacks Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who decides the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in danger since it was published in the paper last year, suggesting that he secretly recorded the president's words and speculated about his inability to hold his position.
Mr. Rosenstein said that the news of the Times is false.
"What would happen if the recent FBI investigation against Brett Kavanaugh was flawed or unfair - or if he was found to be innocent in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?"
The big question is, will we elect a Congress that can hold Mr. Trump accountable in the midterm elections?
If we fail in this test, democracy will be left in the cold for a long time.
But I don't think we will fail because we have learned from Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was once exiled by the same Nazis who occupied the house of my embassy in Oscewe.
He survived, fled to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to light a Sabbath lamp on a swastika-marked table.

Roger Federer's Hopes Ahead of the Battle of the Bulge
The Rangers will play their own Rapid Vienna on Thursday, having won against the Austrians after a great draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, they will have a good chance of qualifying from the Europa League Group.
Midfielder Graham Dorans played his first match of the season due to a knee injury in a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes that with the result, they can get to a better place.
"This is a very important point because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We got on the field with confidence and managed to take a point.
I could have won in the end, but overall, the draw tie seems to be a fair result.
They played well in the first half and our team played well in the second half.
Thursday is another big day in Europe.
Hopefully, we'll get three points, but it'll be a tough game, because they had a good result in their last game, but I'm sure with the support of the audience we can get positive results.
Last year was not very good, because of my injury and the changes that have taken place in the club, there are elements of a good feeling in the current position.
Our team is also very good and the boys are also having great fun; the training is going on.
"I hope we can go ahead and succeed by putting the last season behind us."
Women are losing sleep over their retirement savings.
Despite the participants having an idea of how to handle it, very few individuals have spoken to their family members about it.
Half of the respondents in the Nationwide survey said they had spoken to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had spoken to their children about it.
"People want a family member to think about them, but they're not taking action for this conversation," said Holly Schneider, Nationwide's vice president of life insurance business.
Know where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: If you don’t express your wishes well enough, you won’t be able to prepare your family for your care.
Work with your counselor and your family by keeping in touch to discuss where and how you want to take care, because determining the cost of your choice is also very important.
Talk to your financial advisor: Your advisor may look for solutions to address these costs.
If your financing choice for long-term care may include a traditional long-term if-care insurance policy, if you have the money - a hybrid cash-priced life insurance policy or self-insurance with your own assets to help with these expenses.
Resolve from your legal documents: Try to stay away from legal battles.
Take a proper health care proxy so that you can nominate a trusted person to oversee your medical care, and so that if you are unable to communicate, the professional may comply with your wishes.
Think of a power of attorney for your property.
Choose a reliable person to make your financial decisions and make sure that your bills are paid properly when you are disabled.
Don’t forget the little things: Remember that your elderly parents need urgent treatment and are being taken to the hospital.
Do you know anything about your current health and fitness?
Keep these things in writing so that you can be prepared.

Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, adding that the death toll could rise further.
As communication was cut off, rescuers were unable to report any news in the Dongala Regency area north of Palu, which is close to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people have been rescued from Palu after the disaster.
Some important information about the Palu and Dongala of Sulawesi Island:
The capital of the state of Central Sulawesi is Palu, which is located at the end of a narrow inlet on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Dongala is a Regency that covers about 300 km (180 mi) northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The estimated population of this lower status than the state is 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the main sources of economy in the state of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the state, but most of it is located in Morawali, on the opposite side of the Sulawesi coast.
According to Indonesia's disaster response agency, Palu and Dongla have been hit by a tsunami several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed about 200 people in Donga and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, there was a tsunami in Donga that killed nine people.
Indonesia is often hit by earthquakes as it is located in the Pacific volcanic region.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred recently:
2004: A tsunami triggered by a major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people in coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which were in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006 - Indonesia's most populous island, Java, is hit by a 6.8-magnitude earthquake that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude quake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude quake hit one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, causing a 10-metre-high tsunami to hit dozens of villages and kill around 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hits the PD Jaya Regency in Aceh, triggering a devastating tsunami of 2004 and triggering panic.
There was no tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed.

Thousands of homes were destroyed and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Polyn, Alaska's governor and vice-presidential candidate, Sarah Palin's eldest son, has been charged with assault.
According to a report published Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, 29-year-old Palin has been arrested on charges of domestic violence and attempted to evade arrest.
According to the police report, when a known woman went to call the police in connection with the incident, she took the phone away from her.
Palin has been put on an unsecured bond of $500 in the custody of Matt-Su Prettial Facility, KTU said.
He was produced in court on Saturday, where he claimed himself to be "confirmed innocent."
He has been charged with Class A crimes, which means he could face up to one year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
There are also allegations of Class B crimes, which could result in a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Paul has been charged with a crime.
He was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Philippe, in December 2017.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police for the attack.
The case is currently being heard in Alaska's Vatican Court.
She was charged with domestic violence in January 2016 and was charged with domestic violence and drug use.
His wife was accused of slapping him in the face.
In 2016, the Veterans Group criticized Sarah Palin for linking her son's violent behavior to her PSTD service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on Indonesia's Sulawesi island on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication systems have collapsed and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake was felt near Central Sulawesi, northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
The video of the incident is going viral on social media.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people gathered to take part in the beach festival in Palu city.
Federal prosecutors seek death penalty for suspected terrorist attacks in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Saifullo Saipov, who was involved in a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people.
It is alleged that the 30-year-old Saipov, using a home depot rental truck, carried out an attack in October on a bicycle on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, causing cyclists and pedestrians to suffocate.
According to a notice filed in the New York South District praying for the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov was "intentionally" killing eight people and causing "intentional" serious injuries.
According to the court documents, both of them are sufficient to execute the death penalty.
A week after the attack, a federal grand jury has brought 22 charges against Saipov, including eight murder charges, commonly associated with organized crime, as well as allegations of violence and vehicle destruction.
Referring to the way Saipov carried out the "harmful, brutal and deformed" attack, the prosecutors said it needed "sufficient planning and prioritization."
"Cyphilo Habibulaevich cypov whose family and friends suffered injuries, damage and damage are Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, An-Lara Decat, Darren Drake, Ariel Erliz, Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Ale<0xC3><0xA1>ndez
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District of New York was last executed a decade ago.
Khalid Burns was convicted of murdering two drug peddlers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last execution in a New York federal case was in 1953 against a married couple named Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were accused of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Both of Rosenberg's parents were sentenced to death on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a resident of Uzbekistan, did not release any regrets, the court reports.
Police said they were happy after the incident.
Saipov told officials that he was inspired by a video of ISIS on the phone at home, which is alleged to have carried out the attack.
Police said they also asked for the ISIS flag to be placed in their hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "clearly disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We think that decision making of the search for the death penalty rather than granting a life sentence will prolong the trauma of this incident among everyone involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's legal team had previously appealed for the death penalty.
Tory said Nigel Farage should be given the responsibility of discussing Brexit.
Nigel Farage promised to "integrate the people's forces" at a rally in Tory today.
The former Wikileaks leader said politicians had "touched the heat" from Euroseptics, while Theresa May's own MP said she should be given the responsibility of negotiating with the EU.
Conservative leader Peter sister said at a rally in Birmingham that if Mr. Farage had been Brexit secretary, the UK would have already been "out of the EU."
However, the ice cream that Mrs May is eating to keep her deeply divided office-bearers in one place was once again evident when she took part in another anti-Brexit demonstration in the city of Tories.
One of these Brexit-backed checkers is eating ice to keep the deal right between the anti-Brexit and the EU's attack.
His allies insist that despite the opposition, a deal with Brussels - and would force Euroseptics and Labour - to make a choice between its package and "disorder."
Mr. Solihale's sister, Liv Mins, told the rally that she wanted "check checkers."
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be made a colleague and given the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have come out of it,” he said.
Welinboro MP added: “I will support Brexit, but Chuck checkers are needed.”
He told his opponents in the EU: “We did not wage war to live in conformity.
We want to make laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bonn has ruled out the possibility of changing the opinion of the people after the 2016 vote. The idea that the British people want to change their views is completely untrue.
Andre Jenkins, a Tory Brexit supporter, was also at the rally, who told reporters: "That's all I want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Checkers are disliked by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it. Our team of people and activists are also disliked by those who have brought us here.
Checkers, hurry up and try to listen.”
In a sharp reference to Ms May, she said: “The Prime Minister is considering his position where his promise should be kept.”
Mr Farrez said at the rally that politicians should be forced to "understand the dire situation" if they are betrayed by the 2016 referendum decision.
“It is now a matter of faith among the people and politicians,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re going to tell them, ‘If we do that, we’re not going to let you run away.’
To the enthusiastic public, he said: “I want politicians who are trying to betray Brexit to face a hostile situation.
“We are driving the people’s army who have won our Brexit and will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud UK.”
Meanwhile, anti-Brexit protesters staged a two-hour march through the city centre in Birmingham.
Brexit banners were displayed against the Tories after a team of workers was formed later this week.
Labour leader Adonis ridiculed the Conservatives at the conference after suffering from a security problem on a party app.
“Some people are telling us that they can keep our borders open, free trade along the Ireland border, Canada’s plus plus and IT systems in place,” he added.
“It’s a total waste.
"There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren is looking to be a candidate for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would think deeply about her candidacy after the November vote.
The Boston Globe said the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a visit to a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is often critical of President Trump, is contesting against GOP State candidate Geoff Deal in the November re-election, who was also vice president of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
There are speculations that he will be competing with Trump in the 2020 election.
The meeting was the 36th with his organisers at Hollyock Town Hall on Saturday evening after Trump took office.
One of the participants asked him about his candidacy for president.
"The time has come for a woman-led government to overcome this broken government," Warren said.
Arrested for shooting U.S. soldier
Baton Rouge, LA Police said on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for shooting LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
The 20-year-old Deton Simpson was arrested at 11 a.m., the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, requesting to identify the person in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot dead on Friday morning on the campus of Southern University.
Police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media that "Wed Sims was shot in the head and killed," 247 Sports reported.
Wedd was hit by Simpson's hand while saving his friend.
Simpson has been arrested and admitted to being on the scene, he has found weapons, and he has confessed to shooting Wed Sims.
Simpson was arrested and taken into custody by the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Growing up in Baton Rouge, Sims played from the start in 10 matches and played a total of 32 matches last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton moves closer to world title by relying on the gifted victory of fellow Sebastian Vettel
It became clear on Saturday that Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton, saying that the order of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
From the pole, Bots started well, almost ignoring Hamilton, holding his position on the first two left and inviting Vettel to attack his own team player.
Vettel left Hamilton behind in the crowd, which could have been decisive.
The Mercedes driver pitted in the next lap and followed Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after the tug-of-war to see that the Ferrari driver left the inside blank with the risk of a double-turned unintentionally missed opportunity.
Max Verstappen started from the back row on his 21st birthday and was ranked number seven after the first lap.
He then went on to finish first in the race, then trailing Kimi Raikkonen in the fourth place with a bad tire.
He batted No. 44 in the lap, but could not speed up the rest of the eight laps, leaving Rykon in fourth place.
It was a tough day, because Valtteri fought well all weekend and acted like a real gentleman.
"The team is doing a great job of putting in the first place," Hamilton said.
It was a bad body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday, claiming that she had not leaked a letter written by Christine Blaze Ford accusing the Supreme Court of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about the issue, but instead said that what is going on in the Senate is exposing people's "low and nasty and false" mentality.
"That's one thing that could have been and the beautiful thing that's been going on in the Senate for the past few weeks, you'll see anger, when you see the low and the ugly and the liars," he said.
"When they see the information being leaked, they will say, 'Oh, I didn't do that.'
Oh, I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Diana Feinstein, what did you find?
Do you remember the answer to the question, "Oh, what?"
Oh, no.
I didn't catch it."
Hey, wait a minute.
"We didn't, we didn't," he said.
The letter was sent to Ford Feinstein in July with a description of the allegations against Kavanaugh, and the letter was leaked in September - but Feinstein denied the letter was leaked from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak anything," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill's report.
"He asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret according to his word."
But the president did not digest his words, he opened his mouth at Saturday night's rally: "I'll tell you what happened, it was a very bad body language."
Maybe he didn't, but I've never seen a worse body language than that."
Speaking on behalf of Supreme Court nominee, who is accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president said Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
They want to regain power at any cost.
"Look at the low mentality, look at the rudeness, don't let them hurt anyone, don't let anyone trample on power and control," he said.

Air traffic controllers saved hundreds of lives in an earthquake in exchange for their lives
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been awarded the hero's status after he died while helping to fly a plane with more than 100 passengers.
More than 800 people died on the island of Sulawesi on Friday due to a massive earthquake.
The area is repeatedly shaken by strong tremors and people are trapped in the debris in the pool.
But despite all the fellows fleeing for fear of life, 21-year-old Antonios Gunavan Palur Mutiyara did not leave the control tower at Sis al-Jufri Airport.
He went on to confirm that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could fly safely.
Then he jumped down in fear of breaking the control tower.
He later died in the hospital.
Johannes Sirite, a spokesman for Indonesia Air Navigation, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News.
We arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a big hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken when we hear this news," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could go up to thousands, the disaster response agency said, adding that communication between Dongala, Sigi and Butong cities has been limited.
"It is estimated that the death toll is increasing as many bodies are trapped under debris that have not yet been reached," said Sutopo Puryo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
The six-metre-high wave of destruction in Palu drives the lila where mass graves will be arranged on Sunday.
Relief and assistance is being provided by military and commercial aircraft.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: “The bodies are coming in the ambulance every minute. “The bodies are coming in the ambulance every minute.
There is no clean water.
Small markets have been looted everywhere."
Jane Galfond, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is quickly taking help from the survivors, but we don't know what we'll see there."
It's already sad, but the situation could get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo told the country's military on Sunday: "I urge you to continue to work day and night in rescue operations.
Are you ready?" the CNN report.
Earlier this year, Indonesia's Lombok earthquake killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: One missing in Legun plane crash, says Air New Guinea
An airline plane crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia and reported earlier that all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued from the sinking plane.
Air New Guinea said in a report on Saturday afternoon that a male passenger could not be found.
The airline said it was working with local administrations, hospitals and investigators to find out.
The airline immediately declined to provide details of the passenger's age and nationality.
The plane helped rescue some of the local boat passengers and crew after it crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuck Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were also in the hospital on Saturday, and all were in stable condition.
It is not yet clear what caused the accident.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane went down in the water before it reached the runway.
A number of witnesses believed the plane had crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jens said the plane had gone down.
"That's a good thing," Jens said.
Jens said he and the others crossed the waist water and reached the emergency door of the sinking plane.
He said that the passengers were screaming in terror and suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that the sailors, who were engaged in the work of a Jetty Sarai nearby, also helped in the rescue. They brought people to shore by a windy boat before the plane sank in 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died on PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but there have been no air New Guinea accidents.
Investigators have found the woman's body burned to death.
The prosecution filed the case on Saturday in re-trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014 in Mississippi.
U.S. Judicial Analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He describes in front of the jury how the 29-year-old defendant used cell phone records to create the events of the night of his death in Quinton Teles and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers.
Rowlett said he recovered a number of cellphones that showed that Teles and Chambers were together on the evening of his death, which was reported by Clarinet Laser, against the earlier teles.
According to the information, he was with his cell phone chambers at the time, although he pretended that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in town that night.
When prosecutors questioned whether Teles was telling the truth that he was in a Sanford truck that night, Sanford replied that "it was a lie, because his truck was in Nashville that day."
Another inconsistencies are that Teles said he knew her two weeks before Chambers' death.
Cell phone records show that they have known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Teles deleted text, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He's been kicked out of his life," Haley said.
The final hearing of the case was held on Sunday.
The judge said the case is expected to go to court the next day.
The High Breed: What's the Consus Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative thoughts of this genre by conveying a positive message within the music.
Bristol's The High Breed, dubbed hip hop, has moved away from its political message and the core stream of social problems it faces.
They want to go back to their original stream and make Constance Hip Hop popular again.
Artists like The Fuses and Common have recently seen a resurgence through artists like Akala and Loki in the UK.
Another black man?!
New York's Nanny has filed a lawsuit against a couple on charges of being fired after the "discriminatory" text.
A New York-based nun is suing the concerned couple for discriminatory extradition after receiving misleading text from a mother, calling him "another black."
The couple denied the allegations of racial discrimination and sought a lawsuit against "Julum."
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Falxman, expressed her disappointment after arriving on the first day of work in 2016 after learning that Gizel Morris, a black man, was the baby's new caregiver.
"Naaaaaaaaa another black," Ms. Plasco-Falxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, twice.
Later on, realizing her mistake, "disastered" Plasco-Palxman fired Miss Morris. She said that her former nanny, who was an African-American, had expected a Filipino as a result of working poorly, reports the New York Post.
Ms. Morris was given a day's wage and then sent home to Uber.
Morris is now suing the couple for compensation in the extradition case and seeking compensation as $350 a day for six months, although he was initially hired as a housewife without a contract.
"I want to show them, see, it can't be done," he told the post on Friday, adding, "I know this is discrimination."
The couple objected to their claim that the expulsion of Maurice was a reasonable act of fear that he could not be trusted after he has been charged.
"He didn't want to tell me what my wife sent.
He is not a racist.
"We're not a racist couple," her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"Would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've abused, even if they've done it wrong?"
Your babysitting?
Tell me."
On the allegations of “Julum”, Plasco said his wife had given birth to a baby just two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation”.
"Do you want to fight someone like that?"
"It's not a good investment," he said.
The couple's conduct and arguments were strongly condemned by the public court on social media in the wake of the ongoing legal case.
The Paddington publication has expressed fears that readers may not be able to relate themselves to the talking bear, published in a new paper.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said of the letter: "It is difficult to say what the mind of the first reader will be."
It's interesting to learn about the great success of Paddington.
His father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before getting inspiration from the little toy bear to write children's books, said he would be hopeful of rejecting his work. He also said that the 60th anniversary of the book's release following his death last year was "unusual" for him.
Regarding Paddington, whom he described as "a very important member of our family," he said his father was very proud of his ultimate success.
"He was a quiet man, and not a arrogant man," he said.
"But Paddington was so real to him that it was as if your own child had achieved some success: you are proud of him, even if you have no qualms about it.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was the fruit of his own creation and imagination, he always credited himself to Paddington.
My daughter was on the way to death and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Nice Hospital, Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nad used to call regularly and say it's too bad, and he probably won't survive," Ms. Eden-Laperoz said.
"Then I got Nad's phone and found out he was going to die in two minutes and I was forced to say goodbye to him on the phone.
And I do that.
I said, "I love you, dear.
I will come to you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medicine that the doctors gave to keep his heart moving was gradually stopping working in his body and coming out of his body.
He died a short time ago, and then everything stopped.
I had no choice but to wait.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was so close to family and people.
I had to hold myself."
Finally, Mrs. Eden-Laperoz, then mourning the death of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers - she was paralysed for this difficult situation.
No one knows," he said.
“I had my head down and my eyes were watering.
It's impossible to describe it, but I was sitting on the plane in sync with the inescapable pain of the NAD.
He needs my love and compassion.
I know how much he loved her.
The woman posted a suicide note on the bridge.
Two women, who have lost their loved ones to suicide, work to stop the suicide of others.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted inspirational messages on Wells Bridge and placed phone numbers where people could call for help.
Tyler, the son of Miss Davis, had been suffering from depression since the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I'm doing all the time," he said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Leeds, said her son was a promising chef and had an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone would have said that his smile brightened the house."
However, before he died, he left work, because he had "really gone into the dark."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found him dead.
“I am constantly worried that this effort will be interrupted,” said Ms Davis.
Mrs. Davis wrote, "To let everyone know that there is a man you can talk to, he can be a friend."
Don't just sit there and talk.
Mrs. Humphries, who has been Mrs. Davis's girlfriend for many years, has lost her 15-year-old partner Mark, only after her mother's death.
"He never said that his mind was bad or he was depressed or anything else," she said.
"I noticed some changes in his use a couple of days before Christmas.
"She was in a very bad condition on Christmas Day - she didn't even open her eyes when the kids opened their presents."
He said his death was a huge emotional blow to them, but it had to be overcome: "It created a huge vacuum in the family."
They've disintegrated us.
But we have to fight along the way."

Brett Kavanaugh's future to be questioned by the FBI
“I thought, if we could give him anything he wanted – since the time of the investigation is limited, the opportunity is limited – we could probably bring some unity,” Mr. Fleck said on Saturday. He added that he was also concerned that the committee might “fall into disarray” in the wake of this biased stalemate.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their obligations are related to time.
On November 6, just five weeks left for the midterm elections - if, as expected, Republicans do poorly, their efforts to get the people they like in the country's highest court will be too weak.
George W. Bush is calling senators and lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House under Mr. Bush. Through him, Mr. Bush met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report is submitted?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not clear whether Mr Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and secure him in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors "comes" under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Bing-Seg, quoting data from South Korea's Ministry of Unification, said the number of defectors last year was 1,127 - up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said strict border controls between North Korea and China and the money laundering of human traffickers was the main reason.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments on the matter.
A large number of North Koreans have been granted South Korean citizenship.
More than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most have fled to China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and is much easier than crossing the highly protected disarmament zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats these refugees not as refugees, but as illegal immigrants and often force them back to their country.
Relations between North and South Korea - which are still in the war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks on denuclearization.
This comes after a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they fairly agreed to work towards building a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress.
"If the United States does not have confidence in our national security, we will have no confidence in our national security and in such a situation, we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves first," Mr Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysteria-stricken". She said she was ineligible to serve in the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysteria-infected" and said he was "naturally inappropriate" to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas on Saturday.
Pelosi told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday about Kavanaugh's reaction to his testimony, "I never thought that if a woman had ever done something like this, she would have been called 'hysteria-infected'."
Kavanaugh has denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blaze while they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was passionate about his family and high school life, screaming and holding his breath.
He categorically denounced the Democrats on the committee and described the allegations against him as a "foolish and joking character" organized by the Liberals, alleging that it was being done because of Hillary Clinton's anger at the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he is not worthy of the Supreme Court because it proves that he is biased against Democrats.
"I think he has proved himself unfit for the statement he made and the way he has resisted Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
When asked if Kavanaugh was convinced and whether the Democrats would impeach him if he won a majority in the House, Pelosi denied it.
"I would say that -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI -- he's not only not worthy of the Supreme Court, but also unqualified of the court he's in now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned that Kavanaugh would oppose the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade because he himself is a Conservative Justice.
In his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would change some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"It can't be allowed to happen that a hysteria-injured, biased person will go to court and tell us 'Isn't it great,'" Pelosi said.
Women need to control it.
It's a fair debate, months and years of anger have been coming out, and she can't stop crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Ms Steinme told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's rare, what do you say?"
"A woman executive has helped me a lot, who used to say that she would cry when she was angry, but she chose this approach that when she started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You may think I'm sad, because I'm crying."
I'm really angry."
Then he continued.
I thought it was awesome."
Tears act partly as an expression of anger, as they are essentially a victim of misunderstanding.
One of my earliest memories of a job, a male-dominated office, where I once saw myself crying in unimaginable rage, an old woman holding my scarf - that was a terrible manager I was always a little afraid of - who dragged me down the stairs.
"Don't let them see that you're crying," she said.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to see you."
Patrick Schroeder, the then Colorado Democratic Congresswoman, worked with him during Gary Hart's presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on a boat called Manky Business abroad about extramarital affairs and left the race for dirty work, Ms. Schroder felt deeply disappointed that there was no reason not to be a candidate for her own presidency.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," he said, smiling after 30 years.
"There are already seven other candidates in the fray, and no one wants another candidate.
One called it "snow white and seven dwarfs."
As the campaign was delayed at the beginning, he was lagging behind in fundraising, and so he vowed not to run the race without raising $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
He saw that if a supporter was given $1,000 to a man, he would be given only $250.
"Do they think I'll get paid?" he said surprised.
When he announced that he would not run a formal campaign, he was deeply moved by his passion and gratitude to his supporters, his frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise money, and he left delegates and targeted voters, and became angry about gender inequality.
"You might think I've had a neurological disorder," Ms Schroeder recalled in the media.
"You could have thought that Clenix was my corporate sponsor.
I wondered where they would bury me.
"He was crying?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could go for Beijing
The first phase of the U.S.-China trade war was collapsing, and when the final phase of the war, Beijing could benefit from the long-term conflict between the two countries, like experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump warned earlier this year that major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum, would be taxed.
The most significant breakthrough came this week, when almost half of the total imports from China, amounting to about $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), were placed on new tariffs.
Beijing has retaliated as usual - most recently it has increased tariffs by five to ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has decided to fight eye to eye, and there is no chance of the world's second-largest economy coming down soon.
It would be a great shame for Chinese President <0x58>i Jinping to publicly bow his head to the United States.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play Tas properly, U.S. trade war pressures can help China positively in the long run by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
"Any quick political decision by either Washington or Beijing could lead to an economic collapse in both countries is far more dangerous than the idea of a well-known metropolis," said Abigail Grace, a fellow researcher at the Center for New American Security, a think-tank that studies Asia.
Syria is “ready” to take back its refugees, the foreign minister said.
Syria says the country is ready to voluntarily return refugees, and has called for the rebuilding of the seven-year-old war-ravaged country.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Molaym said the situation in the country was improving.
"The situation is stable and secure today because of the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore normalcy in the areas destroyed by terrorists.
All conditions are now favorable for people who are forced to leave the country voluntarily due to terrorism and the loss of livelihood due to the global economic situation.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
The remaining 6 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government welcomed all assistance in rebuilding the country.
However, he stressed that no conditional assistance would be taken or the support of the rebels would be taken.
Europe's winner of the Paris Ryder Cup
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup with a 16.5-10.5 final score at Le Golf National outside Paris in France.
The U.S. has been defeated six times in Europe and has not won a rider's cup since 1993.
Team Europe, led by Danish captain Thomas Bynes, reached the 14.5 points required to defeat the United States and regained the title.
American star Phil Mickelson, who did not play well in most of the tournament, hit his T-shot in the 16th hole, and lost his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinary became one of only 1 in 4 to score above 5-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979, showing brilliant performances across all rounds.
American Jordan Spieth, Europe's lowest-ranked player, has been knocked out of 5 and 4 by Denmark's Thorbjorn Olsen.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who probably played his last Ryder Cup.
Experienced in the eight-time Ryder Cup, Spain's Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a became Europe's all-time winner with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but this time I can't.
It's been a bad year.
Thank you for believing in me and for voting for me.
I'm happy to get the cup back.
"It's a success of the team, I'm happy that I've been able to help," Garcia said, emphasizing on European victory.
He was handed over to his country's John Ram, who lost to American legend golfer Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in the singles on Sunday.
"I'm so proud of Tiger Woods and I grew up watching him," said 23-year-old John Ram.
Woods has lost four of his matches in France, setting his record in the Ryder Cup 13-21-3.
For one of the best players of all time, this is the unspeakable statistic, which has only won 14 major titles since top-ranked Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA, apart from high-quality performance exhibitors Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finnau, has been in a slump for the entire weekend.
U.S. captain Jim Furick, after his team's disappointing performance, said: "I'm proud of them, they fought.
This morning we put a little bit of pressure on Europe.
We couldn't.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a good leader.
All of his 12 players played very well.
"We will turn around, I will work with the PGA and the Rider Cup Committee of America and move forward.
I love these two guys and I'm proud to be their leader.
You have to respect them.
We didn't get into the game."
Red Current Update: Density decreases in Pineapple, Manatee and Sarasota
A new report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission showed a general decrease in the red current concentration in the Tampa Bay region.
According to the FWC, the Bloom situation of the pachy has been observed in the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier - which are signs of a decrease in density.
The Bloom of the red stream stretches along the coast for about 130 miles from North Pinellas to South Lee County.
Patches can be seen about 10 miles away from the shores of Hillsborough County, but have been less noticeable than last week.
Red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
Medium density along and off the coast in Pinellas County last week, higher than low to low off the coast of Hillsborough County, higher density in Manatee County, higher density on and off Sarasota County coast, medium density in Charlotte County, low density on the coast of Lee County and far away in Collier County.
Shortness of breath is still being reported from Pinellas, Manati and Sarasota, Lee and Colia counties.
There have been no reports of respiratory problems in northwest Florida for the past week.
