When a nanchuan group of living genus (a small population) is separated from the main population (e.g. if they move to a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot move back) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were before.
In this new environment, different resources and different competitors are needed, the new population will need different facilities or adaptations that will be stronger than the earlier requirement.
The basic population has not changed at all, but needs the same adaptation as the first one.
