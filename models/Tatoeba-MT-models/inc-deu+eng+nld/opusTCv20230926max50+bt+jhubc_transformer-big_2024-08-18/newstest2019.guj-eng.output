During the hearing of the petition, 1,000 farmers filed an affidavit stating that the state government did not have the right to acquire their land.

As per the new condition, black mail is being sent to seize the land.
If the land is not acquired, such a threat is being seized.
Despite the Supreme Court's August 10 order, the Centre does not file a reply in the High Court.

China is trying to convert the yuan into international currencies at the same level of the euro, yen and pound, including the dollar.
Given the possibility of economic sanctions from the US, India and Russia are exploring the possibility of making this deal in rupees and rubles.
Today, India and Russia have reached an agreement on the S-400 missile system between the United States and the United States.
Russian President Vladimir Putin will sign the agreement with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the second day of his two-day visit to India.
The S-400 deal is in the process of taking out the US dollar for the payment of the deal.
Sources claim that in view of the possibility of economic sanctions from the US, India and Russia are exploring the possibility of making the deal in rupees and rubles.
The U.S. imposed sanctions on China during the trade deal.
In September, Russia signed an S-400 missile deal with China.
Following the deal, US President Donald Trump decided to impose a ban on China.
Due to this ban, it became almost impossible for China to buy missiles using the US dollar.
However, in recent years, China has tried to raise its currency yuan as an international currency against the dollar.
Following this initiative, China has been continuously trying to make the yuan an international currency equivalent to the euro, yen and pound, including the dollar.
China, on the other hand, has the largest reserves of the US dollar in international trade.
China wants to become an international currency.
The US could impose a CAATSA (Countering American Adversaries Through Secession) on the $5 billion mega defence deal.
Last month, the United States imposed sanctions on China for the purchase of the S-400 missile system.
India and Russia have been working on an alternative plan for the deal since then.
Earlier, the US sanctions on the repair deal of INS Chakra, which was leased from Russia, had resulted in an acquisition of an estimated USD 2 billion deal between India and Russia.
The Economic Analyst claims that to get out of such a situation, India should exercise the deal using the Rupee-Ruble Exchange as an international currency.
It is worth noting that so far, all defence deals with Russia have been made through US dollars.
Why was the U.S. Constitution enacted?
US President Donald Trump approved the Katsa law in August to prevent Russia from acting against the interests of the United States at the international level.
It is worth noting that this law of the United States has been designed keeping in mind the activities of Russia.
This includes Russia's 2014 invasion of Ukraine, its involvement in the Syrian civil war, and its interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
And then there was a thousand-year-old secret.
Ajab-Gajb Desk: This story is of a Turkish man who made a big discovery while repairing a house.
When he opened the door of his apartment, he was struck by a wall.
From here he reached an underground tunnel, where he encountered a thousand-year-old city hidden inside the ground.
The pictures of the city show how about 20,000 people lived in this under-ground city with all their belongings and food arrangements.
600 gates to enter the city:
The incident took place in 1963, when a Turkish man living in Kappadosia discovered the underground city.
The wall of his basement collapsed while repairing the house.
From here, an under-ground town named Derinyuku, located at a depth of 280 feet inside the ground, was found.
The size of the 18-story building was perfect.
This under-ground city was sometimes home to 20,000 people, with preparations for everything from rooms, coaches, schools, churches, mausoleums, etc. to ventilation.
There are 600 gates to enter and exit the city.
There are a lot of doors that are open to the public to prevent people from entering the city.
Each floor can be closed separately.
The city is believed to have been built between 780 and 1180 A.D. during the time of the Secondin to keep people safe in the war and natural disasters between the Arabs and the Secondin.
It has become a tourist attraction:
Derinkuu is not the only underground city in the world.
There are many other such cities but this is the largest underground city of them.
Only half of the city can be reached, but this place has been transformed into a popular tourist attraction in Kappadosia.
People come here to see it because of its historical and cultural significance.

Did the title of the song make you cringe?
How can Sultan Mahmud Ghazni of Ghazni, who is a devotee of the Somnath temple and a villain to the common people of India, be a Sanskrit?
In fact, from the research of Delhi University historian Professor Shanta Pandey, it is clear that Ghazni's official language was Sanskrit.
When Shri Somnath Trust honoured Dr. Gautam Patel and Dr. Manibhai Prajapati for their service to Sanskrit, it was natural to question the fact that Sanskrit was the only language spoken by the so-called upper caste Brahmins.
The memory of Pandit Ghulam Dastagir Birajdar of Mumbai was remembered.
The 87-year-old Pandit Birajdar, who spoke in an easy Sanskrit to understand, is still finalising the Sanskrit translation of the Holy Quran before its release.
The Holy Qur'an is the word in Sanskrit.
Ku <0x2B> Ra'an means the voice of the prophet heard or preached on the earth.
Not only did he study in the Pathshala of Solapur, he is one of the great Sanskrit scholars of the country today who is considered to be a finger-tip.
However, while living a simple life, Panditji is not looking to go to the US or other countries to market himself as a Sanskrit Pandit.
The princess of Thailand is the Pandit of Sanskrit.
There's a lot of self-sacrifice there.
Students who are interested in learning Sanskrit from the US have to go to Bonn University in Germany.
In most of the universities except Banaras Hindu University in India, there is also a Ph.D. in Sanskrit which is written in the language of that state.
In Gujarat, Sanskrit is taught only in Gujarati, but remember that in Takshashila and Nalanda universities, education was taught only in Sanskrit medium.
The practice of Sanskrit in Afghanistan, P. Shanta Pandey has said that not only was the language of the Sultan of Ghazni Sanskrit, but he also recorded the coins of his own money being engraved in Sanskrit.
Pandey also noted that the coins were "Mahamud Suratran" which contained the imports of the Quran in Sanskrit and Panini, the architect of the grammar of Sanskrit, was a resident of Shalapur, Afghanistan.
Pandit Nehru, in a huge chapter in "Darshan of My Hindi," has said that the Pashto language of Afghans and Pathans has descended from Sanskrit.
Today, it is widely accepted that not only Indian languages, but Indo-European languages are also derived from Sanskrit.
Another surprising fact is that the main architect of the Constitution, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar and other members of the Constituent Assembly such as Muslims and South India, proposed to make Sanskrit the national language of the country.
Dr. B.V. Keskar and Nazruddin Ahmed were among those who proposed Sanskrit as the national language when the debate on the National Language was held in the Constituent Assembly on 13 September 1949 against Hindi.
In view of the discussion of that day and the report published in the National Herald on September 11, 1949, the insurgency of the Sanskrit language is estimated.
Unfortunately, we have not yet been able to determine a national language.
22 Indian languages, including Hindi, Gujarati, Sanskrit, Urdu, have a place in our Constitution as the official language, but the national language is not the only one.
According to the 2011 census, Sanskrit is now the mother tongue of only 24,821 people in the country.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi also spoke about Sanskrit in the Constituent Assembly with great respect.
In the relevant chapter of his book, he goes on to explain the importance of Sanskrit and the importance that the world's scholars have given to Sanskrit: "In 1874, Sir William Jones said, "God knows how ancient Sanskrit is, but its composition is amazing."
It is more complete than the Greek language, more abundant than the Latin, and more educated than both.
Nehru further notes: "I don't know how many times Sanskrit has become a dead language, that is, since when it has become a folk language."
At present, it is only the language of swearing-in by members of Parliament such as Union Minister Smriti Irani as a Sanskrit language prayer or MP.
We need to revive the year of Sanskrit and make it a living and folk language.
If the dead language of Israel can be revived, Sanskrit is still a living language.
It's important to make sure that it's done in a positive way rather than in a negative way.
After receiving a warm welcome at the airport, who asked Narendra Modi to accompany him?
Prime Minister Narendra Modi was received at the Ahmedabad airport.
At that time, leaders, including the Prime Minister, were present.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi was on his way to Anand after his meeting with the leaders.
WhatsApp users can't do this work more than 5 times, the feature will come soon
WhatsApp is going to bring a big feature for its users.
