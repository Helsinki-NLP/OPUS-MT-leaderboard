Welsh AM (assembly member) is worried about 'images like Muppets'
There is a constraint among some members of the Assembly on the suggestion that the title of his post should be changed to MWP (Member of Welsh).
The reason for this is that it is planned to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
All the AMs associated with the realm of politics are concerned that this can make them laugh.
A Labour AM said its group was concerned that "it should not be linked to Twp and Pwp."
For readers living outside of Wales: in Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means dirt.
A Plaid AM said the entire group was "not happy" and suggested other options.
A Welsh political party said its group was "independent thinkers" over the change of name, but noted that the MWP could have been manipulated by making small verbal changes.
In this context, the letter w in Welsh is pronounced exactly as the letter u in the Yorkshire English pronunciation.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a legal draft on the change of name, said: “The final decision of any deponent in regard to what is called the members of the Legislative Assembly will certainly be a matter for the members themselves.”
According to the Welsh Government Act 2017, the Welsh Assembly has the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission was briefed on the results of public consultation on proposals that had overwhelming support for changing the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
In terms of the title of the AM post, the Commission supported Welsh MPs or WMP, but received the most support MWP option in public consultation.
Apparently, AM is suggesting a number of other options, but there is a lot of difficulty in getting consensus for Presiding Officer Alan Jones, who hopes he will submit a legal draft for the change within a few weeks.
The legislations being prepared for changes will also include other changes in the working methods in the Assembly, including the rules for AM's disqualification and the draft of the committee system.
At the time of debate on law making, AM will get the last vote on the question of what they should be called.
The people of Macedonia are going to hold a referendum to change the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether or not to change their country’s name to “Republic of North Macedonia.”
The popular vote was called to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, a province whose name is Macedonia.
Athens has long been emphasizing that its northern neighbour states the name of its province and has repeatedly objected to its membership bids in the EU and NATO.
A rival in the referendum on the name change, the Macedonian president says he will ignore the vote.
However, Prime Minister Zoran Zev as well as supporters of the referendum have argued that the change in the name is only a means to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are decreasing due to the declining churches in Harlem
Mr Adams said, “The elders I spoke to for history are saying that there used to be bars and churches on every nook.”
"Today, everything is going to end."
He said that it is understandable to reduce the number of times.
He said, “Today, people’s society is being formed in a different way.”
“Bars are no longer like the living room of the neighborhood where people go every day.”
For the churches, they worry that the money spent by selling properties will not last as long as the leaders expected, “and soon these money will be gone or the leaders will come to exactly where they started.”
He further added that the churches may have been converted into property-rights apartment buildings with a variety of people who would not help in securing the remaining places of worship nearby.
"The number of people buying houses in these buildings will continue to grow, and thus there will come a time when these churches will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that most of these people who are coming to these properties will become members of these churches," he said.
In 1870, a decade after St. Martin's, both churches were built by white people of religious society before Harlem's Black Metropolitan Community became.
The original whites of the Methodist religious society moved to the 1930s.
These buildings were occupied by the black people of the religious society who used to worship in nearby places of worship.
St. Martin was taken over by a black religious society under that pastor John Howard Johnson who led the removal of retailers on 125th Street, the place was the prime place for shopping in Harlem, where blacks were opposed to hiring or promoting.
The building was badly damaged by a fire in 1939, but the bell began to be sounded after Father Johnson's followers planned to rebuild it.
David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and St. Martin's successor, called the act of proudly ringing the bell "opening the doors of fate to the poor."
The bell-ringing expert in July described it as something like this: it is "a cultural heritage" and "an invaluable historical instrument."
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first hour in the world to be played by the black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who played a huge hour at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriveder pointed out that no other person was placed in his place in St. Martin.
What happened in St. Martin over the past few months became a complex story of craftsmen and contractors, some of whom were appointed by the common leaders of the church and the rest by the provinces associated with religion.
Parishes made of common leaders on the vestry (where the stuff of worship is kept) gained authority - concerns were raised in July in the province over whether the province would "demand meeting the costs" for the vestry, whether or not to engage in hiring craftsmen and contractors employed in the vestry province.
Some priests in the area complained for lack of clarity on behalf of the province.
A 13-year-old teenager was injured after being attacked by a shark while diving to catch a crab.
Officials say a 13-year-old teenager was attacked and injured by a shark on Saturday, while he was holding the crab while diving in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place near Beacon Beach, Ennisinitas, before 7 a.m.
Chad Hummel, from KSWB-TV in San Diego, said he had been chatting with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning, at the same time he heard a boy screaming for help and then he came out with a group to get him out of the water.
Hummel explained that at first he felt the boy had voiced in the excitement of catching the crab, but then he realized he was shouting, "I'm cutting something!"
I'm cutting something off!"
Hammel said that when he saw the boy, he found that the boy's entire shoulder had been torn.
Hummel said, “I made everyone’s voice to get out of the water: there’s a shark in the water!”
The teenager was admitted to Ready Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is stated to be critical.
The species of the shark that attacked has not been identified.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Gilles told the media that a shark was detected in the area a few weeks ago, but it was found that it is not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles further stated that the victim was seriously injured in the upper part of the torso.
For the purpose of investigation and security, authorities have blocked access to the beach for 48 hours from the Ponto beach of Cassbad to the Swamys beach of Acinitas.
Giles said there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to go to the UK beauty market
By hiring expert assistants with Sainsbury's beauty products, the department is going to include store-style boots, superdrug and Debenhams.
Despite the continued decline in fashion goods and home goods sales, it is going to join the 2.8 billion pound beauty market in the UK with good volumes, these massive beauty products will be tested in 11 stores across the country and if the plan succeeds, the business will be expanded to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty is being made in the supermarket, which aims to find its place in the market after bringing in TVs, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's said that bringing up to 3,000 products for the first time will double the number of products to be offered, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing products of L'Or<0xC3><0xA9>al, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more opportunities with branded products found in shops like Boots.
The supermarket is also resuming its boutique make-up products, so that most products are vegan-friendly - this will increase its demand in small shopkeepers somewhat faster.
Additionally, Perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will also check out the special feature in Sainsbury's two stores, the first of which was opened last week in Croydon, South London and the second is scheduled to open later this year in Cecil Oak, Birmingham.
More and more efforts are being made to increase people's visits to the online shopping and local convenience stores, i.e., the drop in the daily food sales volume in the supermarkets.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said that people like department stores at the outlet will come faster as the supermarket chain is trying to compete with more services and non-food retailers like Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's has been setting up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has opened several stores since the two came to town two years ago, showing that the sale of groceries has been promoted and the deal has been made more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to bring beauty and pharmacy products back into the market was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's did business together with Boots in the early 2000s, but this mixed business had to end because of the way it splits revenues from drug stores in its supermarkets.
Three years ago, Sainsbury's sold 281 stores of the pharmacy business to the owner of the Lloyds pharmacy chain for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, followed by a new strategy.
It said Lloyds will play a key role in the plan by adding La Roche-Posay and Vichy as well as many of the best luxury skincare brands in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the look-and-color of our beauty products, to enhance the environment for our customers.
We have also added specially trained co-workers who will help us in giving advice.
We’ve built our brand’s scope to suit every person’s need and attractive surroundings and in convenient locations, which means we’ve reached an attractive destination for beauty products that challenge the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones Reveals 'Narazzi' After Holi Willoughby Separated From <0xC2><0xA3>11 Million Deal
To focus on his new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV, when TV presenter Holly Bilucci decided to step aside from the 11 million-pound deal for Dragons Den's star Peter Jones' lifestyle brand business, Peter Jones showed 'serious' over it.
Bilubi doesn't have time at all for her homewear and accessories brand True.
The two businesses were compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop
The 37-year-old morning presenter announced his separation on Instagram.
Holly Bilubi parted ways with Dragons Den's star Peter Jones at the last moment from her lucrative lifestyle brand business - to focus on her new best deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources revealed that when the TV's Golden Girl admitted during a tense meeting at the headquarter of Jones' business in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday that she is moving away from her new deal - worth 1.5 million pounds - then Jones expressed his displeasure over it. This means that Billubi no longer has enough time to give their homewear and brandy access to them.
The business was being compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop and was considering doubling it to an estimated 11 million pounds given by Willoughby.
Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was stepping away from True, after which Jones left the UK to go to a holiday home.
A source said: “Holi’s priorities were really ever top notch.
It was supposed to be his long-term future so that the brand was going to move a lot in the next few decades.
His decision shocked everyone involved in this business.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was too close to starting.
The warehouse at Marlow Headquarter is full of goods that are to be sold.”
Experts believe that the separation of the UK's richest star, the morning presenter, could cost the firm millions of dollars as it has invested heavily in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and homewear, and there is a possibility that it may be delayed to start.
Also, it can end a long friendship.
Bilubi's three children and husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for the last ten years.
Willoughby started True with Cap in 2016 and joined in March as 52-year-old Jones chairman.
The couple and Jones, who spend their holidays together in Baldwin's TV production firm, own 40 per cent.
Bilubi has now become the brand ambassador of M&S and will be replaced by Ant McPartlin to host ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
"We don't want to talk about their business case," a source close to Jones said last night.
"We've had a lot of discussions, and then we agreed."
He ridiculed the criticism, saying that the news media would continue to comment on him, with some treating it as "a different job than the president" and becoming much more positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump do so much?
Trump said in his show "News Anchor" voice.
"I didn't give up anyone."
He said Kim's interest was in the second meeting after his first meeting in Singapore in June, a major step taken by Trump in the first meeting to make North Korea nuclear-free.
But, nuclear-free negotiations were stopped.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea is not waiting for a "comprehensive response" from the U.S. to North Korea's early disarmament measures.
Instead, the U.S. has continued to exert pressure to maintain sanctions, he said.
Trump’s rally speech saw a much more optimistic outlook.
"We are engaged in building good relations with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to fight with North Korea.
In which millions of people were killed.
Now our relationship has become very good.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results - including completing a rocket test, helping to free hostages and repatriating the remaining U.S. troops back to their homes.
At the same time, he defended his unusual approach in negotiating relations with Kim.
Directly pointing to the crowd in front of him, Trump said, “It’s very easy to stay in the presidency, but 10,000 people from outside the country are trying to join the area, we’ll have around 200 people to stop them.”
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia devastated an island, killing hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that they did not need them.
Despite the devastation of more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population, no national disaster was declared, as well as a condition for international help.
"In many situations, unfortunately, they were clearly seeing that they were not seeking international help, so it became a bit more challenging," Ms Sumbu said.
Still, Save the Children teamed up with a team to visit Palu, but it is not yet clear whether employees from other countries can come here to help.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing Palu's condition and were looking into whether international agencies would allow contributions to the aid effort.
Given such situations coming up again and again in Indonesia, it seems that no preparation is being made for the outbreak of nature in this country at all.
Although shelters have been built for people suffering from tsunamis in Aceh, they are not like shelters on other beaches.
Palu has seen a decrease in warning sirens for tsunamis, no matter how harmful that warning is, it is likely to lead to increased loss of life.
Whether it's the best time to visit, it's challenging to travel between the many islands of Indonesia.
Arrangement of workers and goods from natural disasters is always complicated.
The earthquake victims are being brought to a hospital in Lombok for treatment, which is far away from Palu and it takes at least three days to reach here from the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia's very poor infrastructure an issue for his election campaign and spent a lot of money to improve roads and railways.
However, Mr. Joko’s administration split due to lack of funds as elections are due to be held again next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have made religious ideology more conservative.
More than 1,000 people died and over ten thousand people were left homeless, as Christian and Muslim gangs were fighting each other on the streets using knives, bows and arrows and other dangerous weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool bends mysteriously to equal Chelsea
On Saturday, at Stamford Bridge in London, Daniel Sturridge scored in the 89th minute to save Liverpool from being out of the Premier League.
Sturridge got a pass from Zerdan Shakiri from a distance of about 30 yards, at the time his team was trailing 1-0 from the Chelsea goal.
He hit the ball with his left foot before making a shot of the very post.
His effort went to the right top corner of the net with height above the box.
Finally, the ball fell out of Kepa Arizabalaga's grip and went into the net.
"It was just an attempt to get in touch with the ball and take it as far away as possible from players like Shak, so I just tried to take as much time as I could for myself," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw the Kante coming and touched once and didn’t think too much about it and just shot.”
Chelsea were leading 1-0 in halftime after the 25th minute score by Belgium's best player Aden Hazard.
Before the ball came close to the midfield and reached the Liverpool Half game, the Blues striker passed Matteo Kovacic in that game.
Kovacic delivered the ball very quickly in the midfield.
Then, he beautifully shot on the ball, leaving Hazard in the box.
Hazard got out of the defense and shot off the net from the left leg behind Liverpool's Alison Baker.
Liverpool will now take on Napoli in the Champions League group stage at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy at 3 pm on Wednesday.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 pm on Thursday in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832 on Sunday morning, the country's disaster agency said.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake and a 20-feet-high tsunami on Friday left many people trapped in the rubble, agency spokesman Sutopo Puro Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, had several buildings collapsed, causing the city to be filled with debris.
Police have detained a 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman to death
An investigation into the murder was launched this morning after the body of a woman was recovered at Birkenhead, Mercside.
The 44-year-old woman's body was found at 7.55 a.m. at John Street in Grayson Muse, with stabbing marks on her body, a 32-year-old man suspected of the act, who was taken into custody.
The police questioned the residents of the area and tried to find out if anyone had seen or heard anything in this regard.

I would also like to appeal to those, especially taxi drivers, who may have captured anything on dashcam footage to contact us because they may have information that is essential for our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed the woman whose body was recovered from the locality of Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, the woman’s family members reached the spot and asked where her body was found this morning.
The police are investigating the incident and said they would soon inform the family of the victim.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Muse is just trying to evacuate his flat, but police have reported that no person is allowed inside or outside the building.
When he came to know about the incident, he remained silent.
People living nearby are now being told that it will take a few hours to get back to the old situation.

Cromwells statue in front of Parliament recently became the most famous monument, re-recorded in 'history'
Its deportation would be ideal justice for the destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, such as its Taliban, created by his radical Purinton followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "stupid" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “The ongoing debate on the removal of statues was full of apprehension that Oliver Cromwell’s statue would be targeted outside the Palace of Westminster.
No order was made for the symbol of the English Civil War nor was it made by Cromwell.
It may be wrong that Cromwell may have sacrificed for the works of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
According to Sir William Hemo Thorcroft, Cromwell's finest representation is evidence of a 19th-century idea and part of the history of a statue that many still consider to be admirable.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people respect Cromwell, perhaps that is why most people still know him as a defender of the Parliament standing against external pressures in the late 19th century in terms of monarchy.
Yet, they are considered to be exactly the exact representative, which has historically remained the subject of debate.
It is evident that our nation has been developing since the mid-17th century conflict, and Cromwell's statue remains a personal identity, reflecting one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are admirable and memorable.”
Deadly pigs attack Chinese farmer, killing farmer
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked by a pig in a market in southwestern China, killing the farmer.
On Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported that only his nickname "Yuan" had been identified, with serious injuries found on his body, near a pig-fed market in Lipunsui, Guizhou province.
On May 30, 2005, a pig breeder farmer in <0x58>injiang, China’s Kinhai province, was preparing to vaccinate pigs in a pig-garden.
He allegedly came to the market on Wednesday with his cousin living in nearby Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, her cousin died and was found to have opened a pig-garden door nearby.
He pointed out that there was a large male pig in the boar with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that a pig weighing 550 pounds attacked the farmer and killed him.
According to Guiang Evening News, her cousin with the nickname "Wu" said, "My cousin's legs were soaked in blood and completely injured."
Security camera footage showed Yuan arriving at the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was recovered about an hour later.
The pig who attacked the person and killed him was not of Yuan or his cousin.
Evening News was told by a market manager that the pig was kept locked so that it could not attack a person, although police collected evidence from the scene of the incident.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
However, rare cases of people being attacked by pigs have also been registered before.
In 2016, a pig in Massachusetts attacked a woman and her husband on their farm causing the person to be seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig attacked a Welsh farmer, at the time he was on his tractor, he attacked the farmer until his wife ran out of the animal.
In 2012 an Oregon farmer was attacked by his pigs and killed him and made his own food, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are generally not aggressive, but they can be "dangerous" if they get a taste of blood.
"They're just playing.
They bite with teeth and are very searchable...they don't hurt you.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
Heavy rains in southwestern US due to the remaining part of the storm Rosa
According to the forecast, the storm Rosa is weakening due to the freezing waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will flood northern Mexico and southwestern America in the coming days.
At 5 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday, the wind speed in Rosa was recorded at 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane, and it was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough has begun to form over the Pacific Ocean and is moving toward the west coast of the United States. Since Rosa is expected to reach the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, much more tropical moisture will begin to enter the northern areas of southwestern America.
Parts of Mexico will receive 10 inches of rain on Monday.
After that, the moisture coming from the trough in the coming days will meet the tropical moisture and bring heavy rainfall to the southwest.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will likely lead to dangerous flooding, drift of debris and landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical moisture will cause the rainfall to drop from 2 to 3 inches in some places, especially in some areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall is likely to be 2 to 4 inches in the southwestern part of the state, especially in most parts of Arizona.
The sporadic nature of tropical rainfall can cause a lot of flooding with poor conditions.
In view of the risk of tropical precipitation, it will be advisable to stay out of the low-lying desert.
Due to heavy rains, the valleys can become dangerous rivers and with the thunderstorm, strong winds and dust will blow in the local areas.
Due to the coming trough, there will be heavy rainfall locally in some parts of the southern California coast.
The total rainfall is likely to be more than half an inch, due to which there may be some amount of debris and there may be a situation of slippage on the roads.
This will be the first rainfall of the season in the region.
There will be some sporadic tropical rain in Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning before the heavy rain on Monday and Tuesday evening.
There will be heavy rain in the four corners on Tuesday and it will continue till Wednesday.
Temperatures may change rapidly throughout the U.S. in the month of October as the Arctic season cools at this time, but there is a lot of heat in tropical regions.
Sometimes due to this short distance, there are strange changes in temperature.
The unusual change in temperature in the Central U.S. on Sunday is a good example of this.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa is about 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the weather will start to get warmer and the heat will increase.
The weather is expected to warm from October in most areas of the Central and Eastern U.S., ranging from southern plains to some areas in the northeast to the wider 80s.
On Tuesday, New York City could reach 80 degrees Celsius, about 10 degrees above average.
According to our long-term climate forecast, we are getting an indication that the first six months of October have plenty of chances to stay above the average temperature of the eastern U.S.
More than 20 million people have heard of Brett Kavanaugh.
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched the trial of Brett Kavanaugh, who appeared in the Supreme Court, and the woman who has accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse, allegedly committed in the 1980s, the woman's name is Christine Blasey Ford, the hearing was shown on six television channels.
Meanwhile, political deadlocks were also seen, with broadcasters halting Friday's regular program of Last-Minute Twist: An Agreement Engineer by Arizona Sen. The lawsuit was filed by FBI's Jeff Flake after investigating charges for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was absolutely sure Cavanagh at a high school party had drunk her drugs and attempted to take her off.
Kavanagh defended himself saying that he was absolutely sure that did not happen at all.
More than 20.4 million people are expected to see Nielsen's report on Friday.
The company was calculating the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Data for PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network, as well as other channels that show it, were not readily available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some difficulty in calculating the people who look at the offices.
From this point of view, this playoff is equal to the number of spectators of a football game or an Academy Award.
Nielsen pointed out that the Fox News channel, which the considering host has overwhelmingly supported Cavanagh's appointment, was ahead of all the channels, with an average of 5.69 million viewers present during the entire day's hearing.
The audience on ABC was 3.26 million and it came in second place.
There were 3.1 million viewers on CBS, 2.94 million on NBC, 2.89 million on MSNBC and 2.52 million on CNN, Nielsen said.
There was a lot of interest from the audience.
Fleck was the central figure in the drama on Friday.
The liberal Republican office issued a statement after the term, saying they would raise their voice on behalf of Cavanagh, who appeared before CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, when protesters were shouting out to oppose the hearing of the Judicial Committee.
When he was being abused, he was standing his eyes down for a few minutes at the time, it was seen live on CNN.
One woman said, "Let me, I'm standing right here in front of you."
“Do you think they’re telling the country the right thing?
They were asked, "Have you been brought to power to make a lot of women powerless?"
Fleck said a statement was issued by his office before the elevator was closed and said he would be able to keep his full word at the committee hearing.
When the Judiciary Committee was pushing Cavanagh’s nomination for the vote for the entire Senate, cable and broadcast channels were showing everything live even after several hours.
But Fleck said he would do so with a full understanding that the FBI would look into allegations against the nominees next week, which are being urged by minority Democrats.
Fleck spoke about this with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Cunnes.
After interacting with Kunes and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Fleck liked power, as it clearly showed that allowing Kavanaugh without an investigation would not get the Republican vote.
President Trump has approved an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of "politics" over Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May asked critics to stop playing with Britain's future by making politics a sport in the European Union and focus on the national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is likely to attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
On the front page of the newspaper, right next to his interview with his former Secretary of State Boris Johnson, an interview in which Boris Johnson tried to suppress the attack on him because of Brexit's so-called checkers plan, his statement was that Britain and the EU should keep in touch with each other, which is "completely meaningless."
Police detain one suspect, Dyton Simpson, for killing LSU player
Police detained a suspect for shooting and killing a 20-year-old crazy LSU basketball player.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said 20-year-old Diaton Simpson has been detained and sent to jail on charges of second-degree murder.
The video of the encounter between Sims and Simpson was released by authorities, and police reported that Sims' glasses had been lost at the time of the encounter.
The police have recovered the glasses from the spot and said that according to the WAFB report related to the CBS, it was found that the DNA belongs to Simpson.
During interrogation, the police said that he fired fatally to kill the madman.
The lawyer's report said that he has been set up for this by paying $350,000.
A preliminary report was released on Friday by the East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's office, which said the death was due to a bullet injury in the neck.
The department credits the Louisiana State Police's Fugutiv Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and people in the area who cooperate with the investigation for custody.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Allewa thanked the law in force in the area for its "intention of hard work and justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
His length was 6 feet 6 inches, he grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne lives, he also played basketball for LSU.
He had gained 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in last season's game.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said on Friday morning that Wade's death has made the team "thirty-two" and "very sad."
“Who will take his place now, there will always be a concern,” Wade said.
Volcano ash found in Mexico City
Ash from the Popocapetal volcano has been found in the southern part of Mexico's capital.
On Saturday, the National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican citizens to stay away from the volcano and said gas and ash had been detected 183 times in 24 hours.
Several tremors and tremors were observed at the centre.
Photos posted on social media showed thin layers of ash coating car windshields visible in the neighborhood of Mexico City, such as Exochimilco.
In September 2017, a 7.1-magnitude earthquake hit Central Mexico, since geologists focused on the increasing activity of volcanoes that are 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital.
The volcano "Don Goo" has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists on the occasion of Independence Vote Anniversary
Six people from Barcelona were detained on Saturday after a clash of pro-independence protesters with riot police, and thousands joined rival demonstrations on the first anniversary of Catalonia's vote on segregation.
A group of masked separatists threw eggs and powder paint at the rioting police, blackening the road, causing inconvenience to commuters.
The police used their batons to control the clash and later resorted to lathicharge.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "no forgetting, no apologies" while federal protesters chanted "Spain remain immortal."
According to a local press report, 14 people who were injured due to the demonstration were treated.
According to Madrid, the October 1 referendum, which is considered illegal, has been escalating tensions in independent-minded areas for over a year, but Catalan separatists have been celebrating it.
The voters chose the best method for independence, though there were few who voted overwhelmingly against secession.
Catalan officials said about 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop people from moving to polling stations in the area amid clashes.
The groups supporting independence stayed there overnight on Friday night to assist the National Police to stop the protests.
The performance was pushed forward, but he was forced to take a different decision.
68-year-old electrician Narciss Terminus arrived with his wife to take part in the separatist protests, he said, adding that he saw no possibility of Catalonia becoming independent.
"Our best year was last year.
"I saw my parents cheering by voting, but it seems like we're stuck now," he said.
Despite a small victory in the regional elections held in December last year, Catalan pro-independence parties struggled to maintain influence with many of their famous leaders this year, whether in exposing themselves or waiting for a barrier to their role in organizing the gathering and continuing declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone to help police, said the clashes between politicians on both sides had been stopped.
"It's been very stressful," she said.
On Saturday, Orol Junqueres, one of nine leaders from Catalonia, who has been in a pre-trial prison since last year's end, announced they would contest next year's European Parliament elections.
"Fighting the European elections as a candidate is the best way to return to democratic importance and condemn the return we have seen in the Spanish government," he said.

Menga beats Livingston 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal ensured Livingston's victory
According to the manager of the Ebrox Club, Livingston, who is fast-paced, surprised the Rangers, which forced Steven Gerrard to take responsibility for his second loss in just 18 matches.
Dolly Menga's strike made the difference that Garry Holt's side move equalled with Hibernian in the second half of the match.
Gerard's side remained one step away from the win at this season's premiership and will face the leaders Hurts, who are eight points behind on Sunday.
Earlier on Thursday, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston has been consistently winning in the six-game division by replacing Kenny Miller last month, replacing head coach Holt.
Livingston missed out on showing off his game to the visitors.
Holt's team should have gone ahead long before scoring, at the same time, their great game caused a variety of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke the record, but trailed by an attempt to score, then Alan Lithgow, after slipping, could only be directed to complete the goal in Craig Lightt's header.
The hosts got a chance to play against the Rangers, they knew they could put the visitors in trouble on set-pieces.
And that's how he got that important goal.
Rangers got a free-kick and Livingston opened, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked to set the menga, which hit a touch and score from the center of the box.
At that stage, the Rangers had consolidated their position, but missed home defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely left behind.
This pattern continued even in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos insisted on being served on Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was intercepted by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor with his feet and Lithgow took over the game completely by flicking from the other Livingston.
Crosses in the Livingston box continued to come and go until the goal was scored, while after the Challenge of Lightweight, two penalty claims were made, one on bringing Glenn Middleton and the other on handball.
Analysis of Livingston's "extraordinary goal"
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont inducted into Tony McCaroni Arena
The extraordinary performance and outcome of Livingston.
For any person, they were the best, they have continued to raise expectations on this growing trajectory.
His playing style and personality have changed dramatically since his return from the top flight, but the most credit goes to Holt's way of redesigning the team since his arrival.
There were a lot of good players.
Captain Hult was a great player, he saved brilliantly, while Menga kept Conor Goldson and Joe Worl in the back.
However, there was a lack of learning in rangers.
The kind of excellent performance he has done many times under Gerard was less than his standard.
Their final ball was short - they were only able to cut to their home side open once - and it was like a few wake-up calls for the Rangers, who kept themselves in the mid-table.
Erdogan received a warm welcome in Cologne.
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (September 29), smiles were scattered but to no avail.
It is President Erdogan's last day on a controversial visit to Germany - aimed at improving relations with NATO's allies.
He has been involved in a number of controversies, including human rights, freedom of the press, and Turkey's invasion of the EU.
After that, Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an spoke on the construction of a very large new mosque in Cologne.
Outside of Turkey, this city is an area where most of the Turkish residents live.
Police prevented a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, citing security reasons, but many supporters flocked to nearby places to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters, some of whom were Kurds, also shouted slogans, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
Two-way protests saw a split between those who welcomed the visitor, some of whom considered him a German Turkish hero, and others insulted him as a voluntary ruler.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after being hit by car
In London, a cyclist died after being hit by a car.
The accident occurred at around 10:15 BST in the south-eastern part of the city, near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a walk-in street in Deptford.
The driver of the car stopped the car and received first aid, but the person died on the spot.
Another cyclist died a few months ago due to hit-and-runs at Children's Street, about a mile from the accident site on Saturday.
Metropolitan police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his family members.
Due to the diversion of the road and diversion of the bus, such incidents are taking place and motorists have been advised to avoid going to such areas.
Long Lartin Jail: Six officers injured due to disturbance
The jail office said six jail officials were injured due to disturbances in the jails of high-security men.
Something went wrong at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still going on.
Specialist "Tornado" officials have been called to fix the disturbance, the disturbances are in a wing in which eight prisoners have been placed.
There were minor injuries on the face of the rights at the spot which were treated.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to fix the accident in HMP Long Lartin.
The injuries of six employees have been treated.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons at all, and it is obvious that the persons responsible for the violence will be sent to the police and they can be imprisoned.”
More than 500 prisoners are in HMP Long Lartin, some of these prisoners are the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison governor was attacked by a prisoner, after which the prison governor was treated in the hospital.
In addition, rioting officials were called to prison in October last year to fix a serious disorder, during which the employee was attacked with a pool ball.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to cause severe flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (dry areas may benefit)
Tropical areas remain under threat after Hurricane Rosa's collision with Arizona, but its full potential is long overdue that it is the only one that the remaining potential of this storm could affect Desert Southwest in the coming weeks, which poses a high risk of flooding.
On Monday and Tuesday, the National Weather Service had already announced that the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, as well as the southern and eastern Nevada of western Arizona, southeastern California, and Utah were likely to receive heavy flooding.
Rain on Monday evening is expected to make a direct exit from the entire Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service, based in Phoenix, tweeted, "Ten tropical cyclones within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950 have maintained tropical storm or depression conditions!
Katrina (1967) was within 40 miles of the storm AZ border.”
The National Hurricane Center model recently estimated that Arizona's Mogolon Rim could receive between 2 and 4 inches of rain, as well as up to 6 inches of rain.
Central Rockies and the Great Basin as well as other areas of Desert Southwest are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, as well as up to 4 inches of rain.
Outside of the high flood risk areas, the rain of Rosa can prove to be a boon as the area is dry.
Although floods remain a matter of serious concern, drought conditions persist in the Southwest, which is likely to benefit a lot from the rains.
According to the U.S. Drawout Monitor, only 40 percent of Arizona's area is very dry, it's the second-highest category of droughts," the weather.com report said.
First, Hurricane Rosa will pass through the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
On Sunday morning, the maximum wind speed was 85 mph, at the time it was 385 mph south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and it is currently moving northwards at 12 mph.
The storm is currently in the cold waters of the Pacific, due to which its power is decreasing.
Thus, it is expected that the power of the tropical storm may cause landslides in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rain is likely in some areas of Mexico, which may increase the risk of flooding.
"It is expected to rain 3 to 6 inches from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, as well as, it is expected to be 10 inches," according to the report of Weather.com.
After that, Rosa will become a tropical storm on Tuesday morning, heading north towards the Arizona border, heading south into Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday night.
“The biggest threat from Rosa or its remnants is Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest, where heavy rain is likely,” the National Hurricane Center said.
It is estimated that these rains have led to rapid floods in the deserts and landslides in the mountainous areas.
Midsummer Norton attack: Four arrested for plotting murder
A 16-year-old minor in Somerset was found injured, attacked with a knife for which three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been detained in connection with the murder.
The teenage boy was found in an injured condition in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsummer Norton at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital for treatment where his condition is said to be "okay."
Aven and Somerset police said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were detained overnight from the Redstock area.
Officials have also appealed to people to contact if a person has any mobile phone footage of the incident.
Trump slams Kavanaugh's troubles as Democratic Party's anger
At a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, Trump said, “Justice Kavanaugh is a person who has been rejected by the ruthless and derogatory tactics of the Democratic Party.”
Trump says the trouble that Kavanaugh is going through is the result of the Democratic Party's anger during his nomination process.
On Thursday, Kavanagh cleared the Congress for what Christine Blasey Ford accused her of sexually assaulting Ford several decades ago in adolescence, while cleaning up Kavanagh has strongly and emotionally refuted this.
Ford also testified about the charge during the hearing.
On Saturday, the President said, “Americans saw the quality and courage of Kavanagh’s finest human being that day.”
Speaking to a crowd of supporters in West Virginia, he said, "To vote for Justice Kavanaugh means to vote for a person who is the most accomplished jurist of our time, he can confirm the law and do justice with the real record of public service."
Talking about the importance of Republican votes in medieval elections, the President referred to Kavanagh's nomination.
"It's only five weeks away from the election that is most important to our lives.
I'm not involved, but I'm actually involved," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for all the candidates who are really qualified."
Trump said the Democrats are on a campaign to "block and block."
A senior GOP ally told CNN that the Senate's first counting of votes in Kavanaugh's nomination will begin on Friday.
Earthquake in Indonesia, tsunami kills hundreds, death toll rises
Officials said on Saturday that when a huge earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, high-altitude waves began to erupt in the sea and at least 384 people died.
On Friday, a festival was being celebrated on the beach of Palu city in which hundreds of people gathered, after the evening when waves of six meters (18 feet) high rose, it caused havoc, causing many people to die and also ruin everything around them.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
“Yesterday, when the tsunami risk occurred, people in the middle were engaged in their activities and were not in a position to leave immediately and were stuck in it,” said Sutopo Puro Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency BNPB in Bryfeng, Jakarta.
“The tsunami not only caused people’s deaths, but it also dragged cars, logs, and houses to the ground, wrapping up. Before attacking the beach, the tsunami traveled at a speed of 800 kmph (497 mph) on the open sea,” Nugroho said.
He said some people climbed trees to protect themselves from the tsunami.
16,700 people were evacuated from 24 centres in Palu.
Photos posted by the Disaster Agency from the airplane showed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges were torn and collapsed and a mosque was also surrounded by water.
The subsequent tremors continued on the rocks in the coastal city on Saturday.
2.4 million people in the area experienced frequent earthquakes.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy generated by the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times more powerful than the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
It pointed out that the geography of the city at the edge of a long, narrow bay could increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho elaborated on the damage, saying it was "very terrible" and caused the collapse of thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels.
The bodies of some people were trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings and 540 people were injured while 29 people were unaccounted for, he said.
Nogroho said there was a high probability of loss of life and damage in the area of Dongla, located 300 kilometres (190 miles) north of Palu, near the epicentre of the earthquake.
Nugroho reported that the communication system in Nagola was "totally damaged."
The Red Cross said in a statement that more than 300,000 people were living here and its staff and volunteers were visiting the affected areas.
It said, “It’s a tragic event from the beginning, but it can be even more terrible.”
On Saturday, the agency criticized why the information was not given earlier if the tsunami was about to hit Palu, although officials said the warning was to be issued but the waves had already gone.
An amateurly made some videos and posted on social media in which it can be seen that the situation on the upper floor of the building was being heard by people on the street below a person and a terrible warning could be heard.
Within a few minutes, too much water started coming out of the middle and dragged buildings and cars with them.
Reuters was not able to authenticate the footage immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage in Palu and cut communication lines, making it difficult for authorities to combine rescue efforts together.
With the assistance of Jakarta and other cities, authorities have started sending cargo planes, officials said, adding that there is still a need to evacuate people and cater to other needs as well as food.
The city's airport has been reopened only for relief efforts and will be closed in October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
Its very scary.
Mr. Doseba informed that the employees of World Vision based in Donugala have made every effort to make Palu city safe, the employees are living in it by making tarpaulin shelters in the courtyard of their office, they have seen the devastation with their own eyes.
"On talking to them, it was revealed that they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
Its very scary.
The relief groups started bringing in supplies for disaster relief seriously, with some people complaining that foreign aid workers with specialised expertise were being denied entry to Palu.
According to Indonesia’s regulations, money, goods and employee assistance from abroad can only be taken if the disaster zone is declared a national disaster zone.
But that hasnt happened yet.
“This disaster is still at the provincial level,” said Auliya Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian-based Red Cross.
“After the government has said that it’s a national disaster, only then can we involve international aid workers in the rescue operation, but that hasn’t happened yet.”
People whose friends and family members were not found in Palu even after the second night of Friday's earthquake and tsunami had hoped that their loved ones would miraculously meet somewhere, as is the case after natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was found trapped in the sewer.
The rescue team pulled a woman out of the rubble on Sunday, next to her child trapped in the rubble for two days.
Indonesian national paragliding team coach Gandon Subando trained two paragliders of the Asian game to find the missing people who had been dedicated to it since the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandgi along with his students was among those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel.
“As a senior in the paragliding field, I am also emotionally stressed,” he said.
Mr. Gendon said the paragliding community started their work only after receiving the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel, sending messages via WhatsApp to the Palu contestants participating in the Beach Festival.
However, only grey marks were visible on his message, not blue marks on it.
"I think that means the messages didn't reach the people," he said.
Stealing $26,750 at an ATM in Levy's Newport
According to a report released by the Newport Police Department, a Brink employee was putting money in an ATM in Levy's Newport on Friday morning, while thieves stole $26,750.
The driver of the car was emptying an ATM in the entertainment complex and preparing to put in more money, said Dennis McCarthy.
When he was busy with his work, “someone ran from behind the Brink employee” and ran away with the bag of money kept to put in.
According to the report, several people present at the scene are suspected, but the police are yet to ascertain the total number of people present at the scene.
Anyone who is aware of their identity should call the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name
Rapper Kanye West is going to change his name.
On Saturday, he tweeted about the change: "Formally his name will be Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West has changed his name for a while and will use the name for the title moniker of his eighth album, released in June.
This change is being made in his presence at Saturday's Night Live, where he is expected to start his new album Yandy.
The show's creator reported that he had removed singer Ariana Grande from the show, who refused to join the show for "emotional reasons."
Along with shortening his current professional name, West had already stated that the word has religious significance for him.
Talking about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy earlier this year, West said, "I believe the word 'Y' has been used many times in the Bible, and according to the Bible it means 'you'."
"That's me, that's you, that's us.
The word is derived from Kanye, which means only one, which is this - it signifies our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is about who we are.
He is one of the many famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs also has many names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has kept his names Love and Brother Love while announcing the name.
An old friend of West, Jay-Z, has also changed his name with or without hyphens and large letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has vowed that the military force will never be used for civilian purposes.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised Saturday at the Teltelko Plaza that “military force will never be used to put pressure on the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on the peaceful movement in Plaza, killing more than 300 people, at a time when left-wing student movements were spreading across Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has promised to support the youth of Mexico, they will grant each month to students studying and open more and more free government universities.
He said that due to unemployment and low opportunities to get education, young people get involved in crime.
The U.S. should double the funding given to AI
As China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of money it spends on research in this area, said Kai-Fu Li, a low-end investor and AI entrepreneur for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The AI made the remarks after a number of U.S. government work, he also said that the U.S. lacks a comprehensive formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China launched a plan last year: it aims to reach No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the AI research budget will give a great start, take a look at all the other countries apart, so the U.S. is far behind this matter, and we are making efforts for the next success of AI,” Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said, “Doubling the fund could double the likelihood that AI’s next big achievement will be in the U.S..”
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published earlier this month by Hutton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Synovation Ventures, is an investor in Face<0x2B>, one of China's best AI companies.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that left the highest-ranked American Othello player far behind, and later he was appointed to the post of executive in Microsoft Research and as president of Google's China branch.
Lee described the technical capabilities of the previous U.S. government, including the robot-related challenges of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and said who would be the next government that would recognize the next visionary.
Lee pointed out that U.S. researchers often face a lot of difficulties in getting government help.
“It’s not China that removes academic leaders, it’s corporate,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired giants from the university to work on AI.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could help the U.S. in its AI efforts.
"According to me, permission to do PhD in AI through green card should be granted on its own."
In July 2017, the State Council of China released its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
China's National Natural Science Foundation gives financial grants to U.S. researchers in the same way that the people of the Academic Institute are funded by the National Science Foundation and other government organizations, but the quality of the work imparting education in China is not very good.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense opened a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, aimed at involving industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month the DARPA launched an initiative called AI Next that spoke of an investment of $2 billion.
For NSF, this investment right now is more than $100 million per year in AI research.
Meanwhile, legislation in the U.S. made that the demand for the creation of a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence would be ignored for months.
The people of Macedonia voted to change the country's name or not.
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia" or not, a work that would resolve the decades-old dispute with Greece, which led to Greece suspending its membership bids in the European Union and NATO.
There is also a province in Greece called Macedonia, which says its northern neighbor is named after its territory, which has two names for the same claimant and is already included in NATO and the European Union.
The two governments made a deal in June based on the new name suggested, but nationalist opponents opposed it and said changing the name of Macedonia would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of the people living in Slavic.
President Gjörz Ivanov said he would not go to the referendum and boycott the campaign, raising doubts that only a minimum of 50 percent of the vote required for the vote would be valid.
The question on the voting ballot would be: “Do you give your consent for the agreement to be reached with Greece for membership of NATO and the EU?”
Proponents of Prime Minister Zoran Zev as well as the name change say Macedonia must be a member of EU and NATO, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, this future is for the young people in Macedonia, this will allow them to live freely in the EU's umbrella because it means a safe life for all of us," said Olivier Georgievska, 79, who lives in Skopje.
While it is not being legally insisted on, most members of Parliament say they will act according to the results of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority is needed to change the name in Parliament.
The State Election Commission said there was no report of irregularities till 1 pm.
However, when the last parliamentary elections were held in 2016, only 16 per cent of the votes were cast, compared to 34 per cent, of which 66 per cent were registered voters.
Gojo Tanevsky, a 62-year-old voter living in the capital, Skopje, said, “I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe.”
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zev, along with his wife Zorika and his son Dushko, went to vote in Macedonia to change the country's name so that the country's name would join NATO and the European Union on September 30, 2018, in Stromica, Macedonia.
Vladimir Kawardarkov, 54, a resident of Skopje, was preparing a small stage in front of Parliament and was putting up chairs in front of tents put up by those who oppose the vote.
“We need NATO and EU membership, but we want to join it by raising our heads and not through an agreement,” Kavdarkov said.
"Our country is poor, but we also have our own self-respect.
If they do not want us to subscribe to the name of Macedonia, then no matter, we can become part of the Euro-Asia integration by joining other countries like China and Russia.”
Prime Minister Zev has said that the membership of NATO will give Macedonia a much-needed investment, with the unemployment rate in the country at more than 20 percent.
“I think a lot of votes will be positive because more than 80 percent of our citizens agree to join the EU and NATO,” Zev said after casting his vote.
He said the "yes" result would "confirm our future."
Last Monday, a survey published by the Institute for Policy Research in Macedonia showed that 30 to 43 percent of the electorate would vote in the required number of votes.
A second survey conducted by Telema TV in Macedonia on Sunday showed that 57 percent of people are planning to vote.
Of those, 70 percent agreed to vote yes.
More than 50 per cent of the votes are needed to be successful.
If the vote fails, the Western government's policy, which is set to be made in May last year, will be the first serious setback.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero forced to defend the entire Brighton to score
Manchester City: Sergio Aguero and Rahim Stirling on Saturday defeated Manchester City 2-0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Ironically, Aguero scored his easy goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian striker was passed in the midfield early.
As soon as he landed in the open field, he got defensive from three Brighton players.
After that, Aguero found himself surrounded by four opposition players.
He pushed a defensive player before moving forward from the corner of the Brighton box.
Then, looking for Stirling, he sent a pass to his left.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to give the ball back to Aguero, Aguero used his left boot to beat Brighton keeper Matthew Ryan and the ball went off his right side and into the net.
City manager Pep Guardiola told the reporter, “Aguero has some problems with his legs, which makes him upset.”
"We talked 55, 60 minutes about his game.
Thats what happened.
We were lucky that they scored at the same time."
But, this was due to Sterling which gave Sky Blues an early advantage in the Premier League encounter.
He scored in the 29th minute.
In that game Aguero got a ball deep in the area of Brighton.
He pulled the ball beautifully from the left side of Leroy Sen.
Sen had a few touchdowns before sending off the good-playing Sterling.
Just before the game's hand slipped, Sky Blues tapped the ball forward.
The Champions League Group Play will now take place in Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55 pm in Sinsim, Germany.
Sherlock wants to beat him by playing against the Rockies.
After the playoff dispute with the Nationals ended, there was no major reason to push for another start.
But, the ever-contesting Skager hopes to score big against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but the playoffs for the Rockies still remain the only possibility, winning the game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
Rockies got a wild-card spot by winning 5-2 at the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to get the first division title.
"Even though we're not playing great, at least we can play to know that the atmosphere of the crowd and the second-team Denver will probably be for the highest level game I'll face this year."
Why would I not want to participate in that game?"
The Nationals are still to be told about the starter for Sunday, but it is being heard that in such a situation the chaser can be included.
Schaezer, who plays for his 34th start, took the risk of a bullpen session on Thursday and will pitch on his normal on Sunday.
Washington's Right Hender finished at 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikes in 220 2/3 innings of this season.
Trump's rally in West Virginia
Talking about the importance of Republican vote in the midterm elections, the President referred to the situation around his Supreme Court in Laket to Brett Kavanaugh.
"All the work done by us will be at stake in November.
There are only five weeks left for the most important election of our lives.
"It's a big election - I'm not involved in it, but I'm really involved, because I'm fighting for all the great candidates," he said.
"You can take a look at this very, very terrible radical group of Democrats, you can see everything that's happening right now," Trump added.
In addition, they are trying to seize power using other necessary means, which you know is meaningless and useless.
To gain power and control, they don't care who is sad, who is capable of it, they just want power and control to get them, but we won't let that happen."
He stated that the campaign of the Democrats is "opposition and obstruction."
"Moreover, you can see what has happened in the last four days, the anger of the Democrats you saw and also how mean and bad they are," he said.
Referring to the Senate Judiciary Committee, he mentioned the name of Democratic Sen. Diane Feinstein, which was highly appreciated by the audience.
"Do you remember his answer?"
Did you get rid of the document?
What.
No, no, I'm looking forward to that - whose body language was really bad - the first time I've seen such a bad body language."
Working is no longer a broad church.
For those who speak their mind, it is not worth it.
When my local party-led activists voted to elect me, it was a big surprise for me.
After all, I am the newest among the Labour MPs whose importance has been greatly diminished – we cannot say all the things in our minds.
This happened with my MP colleague Joan Ryan as he also raised his voice for anti-socialism.
In my case, Sensor Motion denounced me over my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, there were ideologically similar problems in Europe that Jeremy disagreed with senior leaders.
For the Nottingham East Labour Meeting on Friday, it was said that “we wish that all things should be included in the meeting and that they are beneficial.”
During my eight years as a local Labour MP, I mostly saw Friday night GC meetings stay the same.
Sadly, many meetings today do not agree and or are promised that the politics of “kind and generous people” are actually forgotten, here too.
It is clear that if the views are different in the Labour Party, they are not tolerated and for every consideration a decision is taken on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It started here shortly after Jeremy became leader, with colleagues I had already thought he would have political opinions like me, hoping that I would step back and work on positions that I could never agree with - whether it was national security or the single market in the EU.
Whenever I raise my voice for the public — and it doesn’t really matter what I said — there are bad words on social media, there are sharp comments on it, Centre politics are condemned and I’m told I’m not worthy of the Labour Party.
Plus, it’s not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because my comments are linked to politics.
I know the way businessmen work and am dedicated to colleagues who always face sex-related or racial abuse, but do not shy away from raising their voices.
In today’s political era, there are many frustrating aspects, one of which is how to normalize levels of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn claimed that it was important for the Labour Party to promote a culture of intolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer the broad church and every proposal of "distrust" or the change in the party's selection rule has been greatly reduced.
In the last two years, many people advised me and urged me to keep quiet, not to speak too much, and then I would be “recognised to be right.”
But I didn’t get into politics for that.
32 years ago, when I was engaged in labour as a school student, I was incited to oppose the Thatcher government, I was told to give up the broad class of my school altogether, I sought to provide better public services to the people who need them most - whether it was as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I have never hidden any of my politics, including the politics done in the last election.
There is no one in Nottingham East who has any doubts about my policy position and any area that disagrees with my current leadership.
To all those who promoted the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that while the country is moving towards a Brexit that is damaging homes, businesses, and our public services, I do not consider it necessary for the Labour Party to waste my time and energy in showing its sincerity.
But, in reality, I have a message that isn’t for Nottingham Momentum, it’s for my supporters, whether they’re Labour or not: I’m proud that I’m serving you and I promise that my work can’t create any sort of selective risk or political campaign blockage, I’m only interested in things that interest you all.

Iron 38 - 17 Melrose: Reach the top of the undefeated Iron
The two late attempts may have had an impact on the final result to some extent, but there is no doubt that Ire was entitled to victory in this great entertaining match of Tenant's premiership.
Now they are only at the top of the table of ten undefeated sides.
In the end, his defense was excellent, he found the best opportunity he could get, which allowed him to push the home team forward and give coach Peter Murchi a chance to be happy.
“We thoroughly investigated our game and we are still undefeated, so it makes me happy.”
Robin Christie of Melrose stated: “His credit goes to Ire, who redeemed his opportunity as much as possible.”
Grant Anderson's effort on the 14th minute forced Frazier Clemos to face the Irons, but the Warriors gave the yellow card to Scotland's Rory Hughes for the game, which Melrose got a chance to score and Jason Bagen earned a very difficult effort.
With the help of a penalty just before half-time, Klimo raised the ire, he scored and then tried to unilaterally outrun the match 17-5 for the ire at break time.
But Melrose remained better in the second half and turned Patrick Anderson's effort into a goal by Baggot, reducing Leeve's five points.
After that, Ruridih Nott suffered a serious injury which caused the game to be stopped for a long time, he was stretched, then after the game began, Ire went on to try through Stafford McDowell which was converted into a goal by Clemo.
At the time, Ireland's captain Blair McFerson received a yellow card, and then Melrose gave an attempt to extra man Bruce Colvin, who failed to capitalize on it, due to the high pressure at the end of the game.
However, the hosts were left behind and when Strouan Hutchinson got the yellow card due to facing the billa ball's clamour from the penalty line-out, McFerson pulled the iron out of the back and down the touchdown.
After Kelly Rowe gathered David Armstrong's box kick and sent Flanker Gregor Henry away for a fifth attempt on the home side, Cl<0xC3><0xA9>mo turned it into a goal, as they could when the game resumed.
Game stars are still looking for a new career in the restaurant industry
The game's star Ford Kiran is still looking for ways to move into the hospitality industry, some time ago it was revealed that he was selected for the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack is associated with the famous BBC show, in which he works as a writer and has long been a part of the acting of comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have revealed that the upcoming ninth series will be their last series in the show's world, and it seems like they're planning what to do with Kerrnan after Craigslist.
On the basis of the official record list, he is the Director of Adriftmorne Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, yet a Scottish Sun source hinted that Cairns was looking to join an "extreme restaurant trade" based in Glasgow.
'We have a right to the sea': land-restricted Bolivia hopes the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
The military-Navy are patrolling extensively in the Naval Headquarters of La Paz.
Ocean-blue flags are being hoisted on government buildings.
Here is a slogan of the naval base stretching from Lake Titicaca to Amazon: “We have a right over the sea.”
It is our duty to get it back."
Bolivia, the coastal region that lost to Chile in the gruesome land struggles of the 19th century, is still desperate to get its land - they want to wave their flag again in the Pacific Ocean.
He now hopes to regain his Bolivian land decades ago as he waits for a verdict from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"There is now a lot of enthusiasm in Bolivia, a sense of unity and peace, and the hope of the people here is going to yield a positive result," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calazila.
Many Bolivians will see the ICJ’s big decision on big screens across the country, hoping that the decision that will come from The Hague’s court will be in favour of Bolivia – which has been in talks for decades – forcing Chile to return Bolivia’s land to the sea.
Bolivia's best president, Evo Morales, who is set to face controversial contests in next year's re-election, has also expressed his optimism in Monday's ruling.
“We are very close to getting back to the Pacific Ocean,” he said last August.
But, some analysts are assuming that the court's decision will not be in Bolivia's interest - and if the decision comes in its interest, there will be plenty of conditions.
The UN body in the Netherlands does not have the authority to award the province of Chile, and it has determined that the possible outcomes of the talks will not be determined.
Chilean expert in the International Court of Justice Paz Zert said the ICJ's decision comes six months after the final talks, which indicated that the case was "not complicated."
In addition, apart from Bolivia’s conditions, it seems for the last four years that it may come back to a chronic condition.
“The issue of access to the sea has been stopped by the current government of Bolivia,” Jarrett said.
He suggested that Morales' controversial statement had ended Chile's remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate on certain terms, but this time it will be very difficult to negotiate after the decision is made.
The ambassadors of the two countries have not been living in each other’s country since 1962.
Former Bolivian President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltz, who is in the Hague, has denied that the court's decision was unusually fast.
He pointed out that Monday would be an opportunity for Bolivia to "open up new avenues of relations with Chile" and it would be an opportunity to "eliminate 139 years of disagreements on mutual benefit."
California has denied that Morales - who is still one of Latin America's most famous presidents - was politics over the maritime issue.
"Bolivia will never back down for its right to access the Pacific," he said.
“The decision is a chance to go about what we needed to do in the past.”
North Korea says it will not stop nuclear tests until it trusts the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said that his nation will not destroy its nuclear bomb until Washington is trusted.
On Saturday, Ri made a speech at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He asked the United States to fulfill the promises made during the summit in Singapore among the leaders of other countries.
He commented that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo feels he is about to resume nuclear diplomacy more than three months after North Korean leader Kim Jong-un made promises in Singapore.
Ri said it was a "pipe dream" that would be considered a North defeat by sanctions and U.S. objections to the declaration of an end to the Korean War.
Washington is wary of the concurrence of an already important disarmament campaign without Pyongyang's announcement.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
But, it is entirely skeptical that Pyongyang is serious about eliminating the inspection of the nuclear bomb because they do not want to jeopardize the country’s security.
Kim-Trump is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit, which will take place at the behest of the two leaders.
The Paris Fashion Show showcased a variety of new design headwear for your nearest High Street
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely protect your head from sunlight, there is no need to wait any longer.
Both Valentino and Thom Brown designers have created a series of best headwear for their SS19 collections on the runway that featured at the famous Paris Fashion Week of special style.
The best beneficial hats are made to avoid the heat of this year and these designers have sent their beautiful creations to show up on the show.
The best hats made by Valentino were quite large, decorated with wings-like broad brim that hung around the model's head.
The very large side-by-side accessory included bezel design made of waterlamin hats, wizard hats, and pineapple design hats – but they aren’t designed to protect your head from frost.
Thom Brown also showed special design masks - and they can only be used in time for Halloween.
People were surprised to see many colourful masks, and things like Hannibal Laker were seen more than Haute Couture.
One creation saw all kinds of stuff for scuba diving including snowballs and glasses, while the other creation saw a melting ice cream cone design.
Also, if you've seen much bigger fashions - you're lucky.
The style-seeing amateurs estimate that this great collection can soon reach the finest shops around you.
The very large-sized hats will come with a 'La Bombay'-designed heel, with two-foot wide beamed straw hats from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
Behind the best-performing hat was a cut label that looked pretty, with the second creation catwalk posted on social media - featuring the model wearing a swimsuit on a straw beach bag.
The Bernt Orange Raffia bag was trimmed with Rafia Friing and had a white leather handle, the best attraction of Jacqueline's La Rivera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Fashion's famous celebrity Luke Armitage told FMail: "I hope big hats and beach bags will come to stores soon for the upcoming summer season - because designers have been so impressed by it that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for large-sized accessories."
John Edwards: It is important for citizens of foreign countries to have language skills
Scotland’s private schools keep track of the track record of the best education, and since 2018 it has continued to deliver the best exam results, strengthening individual and collective success in sports, art, music, and other community efforts.
More than 30,000 students across Scotland are associated with The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), under their leadership, trying to provide the best possible service to their students and parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for better and higher education, their chosen careers and their places are benefiting citizens of foreign countries.
As an education sector that can build and implement school curriculum, we are seeing that modern languages continue to be used in schools as an alternative to popular and desired subjects.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a person in a language that he understands, you become the best for him.”
If you talk to him in his own language, the thing is very pleasing to his heart.”
When we want to build a relationship and trust people from other countries, we feel we can rely more on English.
In the recent results of this year's exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the league table with the highest passing rates in private schools.
68% of them are students who have obtained the highest grade A in foreign languages.
Data collected by 74 member schools of SCIS can be seen in the data that 72 percent of the students received the highest grade A in Mandarin language, while 72 percent of the students received the highest grade A in German, 69 percent in French and 63 percent of the students received Spanish language grade A.
This suggests that private schools in Scotland are collaborating in foreign languages to provide children and young people with the skills they will need in the future.
Languages are now being included as optional subjects in private schools courses and other subjects like STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics).
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that employers struggled a lot to recruit employees in vacant positions, with 17 percent of candidates lacking language skills.
Therefore, it is becoming imperative to have as many language skills as possible to prepare young people for their future careers.
These skills are necessary to work anywhere in the world due to the high potential employment opportunities that require language.
Regardless of the career choice, if people have learned a second language, then such skills will definitely benefit them in the future.
If you are able to talk to foreign people directly, being a multilingual person will make you stand out on your own in the competition.
In 2013, more than 4,000 adults in the UK took part in the YouGov survey, which found that 75 percent of people could not speak a foreign language enough, and only French was the subject that 15 percent could speak and was the only language to reach a double-digit percentage.
This is why it is important to invest in teaching language to children today.
Having knowledge of many languages, especially the languages of developing countries, will give children better opportunities to find the right jobs.
The languages taught in every school in Scotland will be different.
There are many schools that will focus on more classic modern languages, while other schools will teach languages whose outlook is towards 2020 and are considered the most important for the UK, for example, Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what language your child is interested in learning, they will always be able to choose that language in private schools and they will also find staff who are experts in the field.
Scotland’s private schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children for the future and give them the skills they need to succeed so that they can move forward in the future.
For the global business environment, it cannot be ruled out that it is very important to learn languages in the country for the future, so it should be given a better place in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be accepted as "international communication skills."
Scotland's young people will continue to be given the option to choose this option, diversity and excellence by private schools.
I’ll bet he’s fair.
John Edwards, director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron made his debut in San Diego on Sunday as part of the Lakers
Now the wait for LeBron James fans is over as they are going to play their first match for the Los Angeles Lakers very soon.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James has been chosen as the preseason opener to play against the Denver Naggets in San Diego on Sunday.
However, it remains to be seen how many minutes they will play.
"They'll play at least a minute and a maximum of 48 minutes," Lakers said through the official website.
Lakers correspondent Mike Trudel tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t have to be ready for the preseason game.
Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
Tonight, President Donald Trump held a lot of rallies for the campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Next week, Trump has set five more rallies, including Tennessee and Mississippi, as well as other favourable places.
With the Supreme Court stopping the vote set in its election for appointment to the vacant post, Trump's goal is to seek help for the upcoming mid-term elections as Republicans are at risk of falling out of control of Congress at the time of the vote counting in November.
When will Trump's rally be held in West Virginia tonight and how will you be able to watch it online?
The timing of Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is set for Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7 pm ET.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online via a live stream on YouTube.
Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh is likely to deliver a speech at this week's hearing, with the confirmation of the anticipated Senate vote for a week during the FIT investigation due to allegations of sexual offenses against Kavanaugh.
But the main goal of this tense rally is to help Republicans face the November elections.
"The aim of the next week's five rallies is to ""encourage volunteers and supporters of the Republican effort to protect and increase the majority held by the Senate and the House of Representatives,"" according to Reuters."
According to Reuters, a spokesman who has been removed from Trump's campaign said, "Congress control has become so important to their agenda that the president will only visit states where the season of our campaign will be very busy."
According to West Virginia Metro News, “Set in Wesbanco Arena of Wheeling, the attention of supporters of Ohio and Pennsylvania can be brought to the Pittsburgh media from tonight’s rally.”
Saturday will be the second time last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, where he received more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is coming forward to help West Virginia Republican Senate poll candidate Patrick Morris.
“If the president is trying to give Moris a lead in the election, that’s not a good sign,” said Simon Hyder, political scientist at West Virginia University.
Rider Cup 2018: Team USA showed a willingness to compete to maintain expectations of being at the top in Sunday singles
After three one-on-one sessions, the fourth session on Saturday afternoon will give the result of what is going to happen in this Ryder Cup.
The passage of time cycle is a completely new concept for players, but it cannot be predicted in competitions like when a player goes ahead and which player to rely on.
So, what will they say about this Momentum now?
“They had a six-point lead which has now dropped to four, so I think we have to increase our pace a bit,” said Jordan Spieth, who made the day for a walk.
Of course, Europe took advantage and went ahead by four points with 12 points in the game.
According to Spieth, the American feels they have little chance left and a lot to encourage, not only from the form of Spieth but also from the form of Justin Thomas, who played all day together and both earned three out of four points from their game.
Spieth is deadly for everyone from T to Green and is also the best in the game.
As their game progressed, people cheered and clapped with cheers, when they and Thomas went down two more points after two, putting up four important pieces to complete the all-square.
It was because of his put that his team came in 15th position with the same cream, the sort that tells you that you don't consider the American team out of it.
“You just have to play really well and take care that the win is yours,” Speith said.
This is what they say to all the players who have been out of the game.
18 holes to make a mark.
In the last two days, only two players with more points than Spieth and Thomas, Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, are making history in the Ryder Cup.
Europe's different styled but better couple scored four points in four and are at the forefront.
Saturday afternoon is "Mollywood" was the only pair who didn't shoot any bogies, but they stayed away from bogies until Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning before nine o'clock.
On Sunday, he found a way to get the run and that run in this dominant crowd and from this dominant crowd as if they were beaters, and there was no player who could turn the European team's possible win into a defeat as it seemed like the sunset of Le Golf National would be earlier than that of Fleetwood or Molinary.
It is good that the two are on separate holes in different ways.
However, the dignity of the Europeans has long been talked about.
Buba Watson and Web Simpson made it a little easier for Foreball hero Sergio Garcia in the morning, at the time their pair was paired with Alex Noreen.
A bogey in front of nine dogs and two doubles were holed up by Spaniards and Swedes, before which they could never reach here.
However, on Sunday there was no one who could help you reach your hole.
On seeing Fourball and Foursome were great because the interaction between the pairings was excellent, he advised that he did not need to seek advice and that he was well aware of how to change the strategy.
As a team, Europe played very well and took a significant lead on the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has the ability to compete in a way that is questionable, especially in the stateside.
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe took a 10-6 lead.
Europe will make good use of it on the final day of the Ryder Cup after a 10-six-leading four-ball and four-sum game over the United States on Saturday.
The best pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari took the lead over struggling Tiger Woods with two wins so that they could take their match far ahead of Le Golf Nationals four points.
To avenge his defeat of the trophy two years ago at the Hazeltine, Thomas dominated by the American side misfired at the European side Morning Foreball in Bijon, giving him a 3-1 lead in the series.
The U.S. showed greater resistance in Foursome, winning two matches, but they could not avoid losing.
Jim Furick's side needs eight points in Sunday's 12 singles match to keep the trophy win.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari made their debut with "Mollywood" after the Sensational Weekend, the second pair to win four points in their opening four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After losing to Woods and Patrick Reed in Foreball, he again beat the best player Woods and American Rookie Bryson Deshambu by 5 and 4 points.
Woods, who led himself through two games on Saturday, has shown his best, but now he has lost his 29 matches in Foreball and Foursome and seven in Row 19 times.
In the rest of the morning foreball, Justin Rose, along with his partner Henrik Stansson, will return to Foursome and beat world-ranked one and three players Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copeca 2-1.
However, in the southwest of Paris, on the day of the incident, Europe had no break.
Leading players Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three times on Saturday, set the benchmark for the American by scoring two points.
He scored a 2-1 victory over Spain's John Rahm and Ian Pollter in Foreball and sent Paul and Rory McCleary back in the opening two holes, beating them 4-3.
This has happened only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup when a team came back from a match that reached singles with four points, although the kind of need that Furyk had on his side kept everyone's attention in the trophy.
However, the counter-attack that will take place on Sunday after remaining second-best for two days is going to be as different from their old game.
North Korea says "there is no way" to denuclearize only one side that can't be trusted
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday the United Nations continued to impose sanctions that depended on its mistrust in the United States and showed no way to stop the country from inspecting a nuclear bomb on its own behalf in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the World Body's Annual General Assembly last year that North Korea had tried several ways that were associated with "significant goodwill," such as stopping nuclear bombs and missile tests, demolishing the nuclear bomb testing site, and promising not to pursue the task of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we have not received any response from the US," he said.
“Without trust in the U.S. in any way, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in situations like these, there is no way we can initiate unilateral disarmament.”
While Ri reiterated that the complaints made by North Korea are about Washington's "phased" approach in view of disarmament that would gradually benefit North Korea, his statement makes it perfectly clear that this unilateral disarmament cannot be left alone by one side as Pyongyang has done so before.
At the first summit between the U.S. president and North Korean leader serving in Singapore on June 12, Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the time that Kim had vowed to work towards "disarming the Korean Peninsula" while Trump had pledged to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea is calling for a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang should stop making its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also opposed the call to end strict international sanctions on North Korea.
“The U.S. has first emphasized disarmament and raised the level of sanctions pressure so that it can forcefully achieve its objective, and at the same time, it has also objected to “the declaration of the end of the war.”
"The rebound can tilt us, such a perception is a pipe dream of those who are ignoring us."
But the problem is that our confidence is being undermined by the continued ban.”
Ri did not discuss plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, he said, adding that the U.S. leader had outlined the UN's merits last week.
Instead, the minister discussed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If the party to this problem of disarmament is South Korea and not the U.S., the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not be involved in such a deadlock.”
Still, Ri's speech was very different from last year's speech when he said of the U.N. National Assembly that it was inevitable to target the U.S. mainland with North Korea's rocket after what he called the "rocket man" Trump on the suicide mission.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, had praised Kim's courage to take up disarmament but said there was still a lot of work to be done and sanctions would remain in place until North Korea disarms.
On Wednesday, Trump said he has no time frame for it, “If it takes two years, three years or even five years – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia are arguing that Pyongyang should be rewarded for the steps taken by the UN Security Council.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that: "The Security Council's sanctions should remain in force until we realize that we are completely, last and verified disarmament without failure."
The Security Council has increased sanctions on North Korea with full agreement in 2006 to fund Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile program.
Pompeo met Ri at the UN General Assembly and then told that he would go to Pyongyang again for the second summit next month.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not been good.
They returned from Pyongyang in July and said the work had progressed, only within a few hours North Korea condemned them for "gangster-like demands."
At a Moon meeting this month, North Korea pledged to destroy the missile site and if the United States adopts "consistent measures," it will also destroy the nuclear complex.
They reported that Kim had promised them "consistent measures" they were seeking guarantees of security that Trump would take a resolution in Singapore and that they would move towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking the course for a comfortable job.
Harvard University has launched a new course this year for all its undergraduates who want to get more and more rest while competing in the growing Macho culture for study through caffeine-fueled 'all-nighters'.
A teacher teaching the world's number one university students often doesn't have a choice when it comes to what to do to relax yourself.
Charles Qazisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has created a course for which he believes it is the first of its kind in the US.
After talking about the effect of low sleep at the time of teaching, he came up with the idea to start this course.
“I had a girl come to me at the end of the year and she said: ‘Why do I say that every time I have to go to the next class next year?’
She said no one told her about the importance of sleep – which shocked me.
This year, for the first time, students will know how the good habit of sleeping is important in studies and athletic performance, besides improving their general health.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the University, said students don't sleep enough every week for which the university decided to start the course.
The hour-long course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there will be an image of a dormitory room, where students will click on coffee cups, curtains, instructors and books to tell what effect it will have on caffeine and light and how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of sleep time in the routine.
In the second section, participants will be told that a lack of adequate sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of campuses with interactive icons will be shown, then participants will be encouraged to think about their daily routine.
We know that this will not change the behaviour of students immediately.
But, we believe that they should be aware of this – just as cigarette smoking is known to have an impact on health.”
He said that the culture of feeling proud of "wake up all night" still exists, modern technology and increasing pressure on students means they have to sleep less, which has become a growing problem.
Making sure you sleep enough and in good sleep is like a ‘secret weapon’ for students, which can help them cope with stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – it also protects them from weight-bearing effects because their brain is always thinking about hunger due to lack of sleep, which makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, 19, from California, who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Jesler build the course, completing his last year's class at Harvard last year.
He said that due to the course, he became aware and motivated for the campus-wide course.
In the future, he hopes that all postgraduate students will be required to complete this course before joining a competitive institution.
Prof Jesler suggested that students should consider setting an alarm before going to sleep, as well as deciding when to wake up, and that they should be aware of the harmful effects of the electronic screen and blue light emanating from the LED light, which can put too much circadian on them, causing sleep problems.
Livingston's 1 - 0 against Rangers: Menga scored against Gerard
The Rangers faced trouble in another match due to Dolly Menga's strike, with the responsibility of Livingston's 1-0 win cast on the wrong side of Steven Gerrard.
Ibro Side was looking for his first win after a 4-1 win in a match played at St Johnston in February, but Gary Holt's team provoked Gerard as manager for a second defeat in 18 games to help Landbrooks Premiership leader Hurts be knocked out by eight points.
Before half-time, Menga did a seven-minute strike and after that Rangers' line-up shorts didn't even get a chance to equalize the game.
However, Rangers have now dropped to sixth place in the rankings, Livingston has reached third place and is only behind Hibernian due to the goal difference.
In addition, the game can be even more troublesome for the Rangers since the head wound of Linesman Calum Spence has been treated after the object was clearly thrown at the other end.
The eight changes to Gerard's side gave the previous Ire a chance to make it to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, was included in the same Levi 11 that took a point from the Hurts last week and the way he drilled well made the opposition trouble at every turn.
The Rangers could have won the match, but Livingston played better than them.
When Menga first let-off and sent Scott Peteman to Allen McGregor's goal, he should have given them just two minutes, but the midfielder squandered the big opportunity he found.
When Keagan Jacobs, who was in the deep, made a free-kick, the kick went to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner on the back post, Alan Lithgow, could only have been able to widen the stab.
The Rangers gained control, but in the final third, they had more confidence in their game than they expected.
Certainly Alfredo Morelos felt that he should have imposed a penalty on the quarter-over mark as he and Steven Lawless collided with each other, but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian appeal.
Rangers saved two shots on target in the first-half, but Ibro's former goalkeeper Liam Kelly faced difficulties with Lasana Colibelli's header and Twee Ov Azaria's strike.
However, in the 34th minute, Levi could go against the opener run-off game, but no one can deny that he is the only one entitled to this graffiti.
Even after that, the Rangers couldn't paint the best player Jacob in the Deep.
When Deccan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, Scott Arfield showed no interest in it, Scott Robinson kept the menga quiet to pick up for a simple finish.
When Gerard swapped Calliebell for Ryan Kent and switched to show immediate effect as the winger slotted in Morelos, he took a break, but Kelly blocked his line while running a fine run.
But, Livingstone showed the visitors the kind of game they could really enjoy, sweeping the long ball with Lithgow and the lightweight after the long ball.
Holt's side in the final stage could have extended their lead, but McGregor stopped Jacobs from studying well before widening the corner by Lithgow.
The Rangers called Glenn Middleton as an option, claiming another lay claim to the penalty as they got entangled with Jacobs, but Thomson did not let them succeed again.
Almanac: Inventor of the Geyser Counter
Now a page of our “Sunday Morning” calendar: 136 years from today, September 30, 1882, and the time after that... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
For the method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, Geyser invented a device that was later known as the Geyser counter.
Geyser Counter is a mainstay of science, it has become the mainstay of pop culture, as well as a film "Bells of Coronado" on it in 1950, in which scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans for the first time acted:
Man: "What does he do for the world?"
Rogers: "This is a geyser counter used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
After turning on these earphones, you can definitely hear the effect of hidden atoms because of the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: "Let's say, it's definitely popping right now!"
"Hannah" Geiger died in 1945, at the time he was 63 years old.
However, due to his invention, his name is still alive.
New cancer vaccine can 'see' the bad cells of the immune system
The new cancer vaccine can ‘see’ and eliminate bad immune cells
The vaccine instructs the immune system to identify bad cells during treatment.
Through this method, the immune cells of a patient in the laboratory can be removed and replaced
After that, the common protein for many cancers from them can be ‘looked up’ and then removed and reused
In a trial for the vaccine, promising results are being seen in different types of cancer patients.
A woman was given the vaccine, which looked at her damaged cells in the immune system, then it was found that her ovarian cancer, which had been present for more than 18 months, had disappeared.
This method can remove and replace the immune cells of a patient in the laboratory, so that they can "see" the common proteins found in many cancers called HER2, and then reabsorb the cells.
J. Berzofsky, a professor at the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that this vaccine is very promising.”
Prof Berzofsky said that HER2 causes "many types of cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers.
It is beneficial in the treatment of leukemia of a kind to remove the immune cells of patients and to "direct" them to detect cancerous cells.
After his SNL presence, Kanye West on the MAGA hat denounced Trump's old controversial speech.
It didn't go well
After Kanye West's best performance, in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said his government would be formed in 2020, he denounced in the studio during Saturday's night live.
After performing his third song of the night called Ghost Town, in which he wore the Make America Great Cap, he denounced the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“So, I talk to gorge people many times and they say: “What’s the reason for you to like Trump, they’re racist?”
Yet, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left the United States long ago.”
SNL started the show with Matt Damon's skit, in which the Hollywood star made a mockery of Brett Kavanaugh's case, it is already known that the Senate Judicial Committee is already investigating claims of sexual assault on him by Christine Blasey Ford.
However, nothing like this was shown, footage of West's condemnation was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It was not revealed whether Rock was attempting to blow the West’s laugh with postings because of the post.
Along with this, West complained to the audience that he was threatened by going to the backstage with his headwear.
"They threatened me with backstabbing.
You dont go there wearing that hat, he said.
They threatened me!
"I'm stuck in the wrong place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West said: “You want to see that wrong place?” At the same time, they said “will make plays for my Superman Cape, because that means you can’t tell what to do with me. The desire of the world to move forward is what you keep?
Love you."
In his comments, he mentioned the audience at least twice and the SNL artist felt embarrassed, in a separate report one person told the publication: “The whole studio was completely silent.”
West was called off due to a delay in the arrival of singer Ariana Grande, a few days ago when Ariana Grande's old boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died.
West surprised many viewers by performing on the song I Love It, she was dressed like Periyar Bottle.
West again met with the head of the Conservative group TPUSA, Candice Turner, who tweeted: “For one of the bravest people: thanks for raising the voice for the public.”
But, the talk show's host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was "just what she told us and which is absolutely amazing."
“But, I didn’t choose someone who took advantage (by buying my music or clothing or by supporting my “art”) that, in my opinion, is promoting the wrong idea for my community or saying my community wrong.
He is free.
That's why we exist," he said.
Before the show, the rapper tweeted on Twitter that he had changed his name, as well, adding that he was just "officially going to be known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, but before that, Diddy and Puffie, whose old names were Puff Diddy and P Diddy, respectively.
Along with him, the rapper, Snoop Dog's old name was Snoop Lion and the late famous Prince of Music also changed his name to the symbol and after that the artist was already known as the Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Herrington questions toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his sword-wielding role as John Snow in HBO's Vivalent Middle Fantasy Series Game of Thrones.
But, the 31-year-old actor has questioned the role of Macho Hero, saying that watching such roles on screen often inspires many young boys and he feels it is necessary to do such a difficult job to get respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit told that he was feeling "something wrong" and asked how to eliminate the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Recently, Kitt married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 31, believing she felt "very strongly" in talking about the problem.
"""Personally, I think very strongly that right now - are we doing something wrong with masculinity?"
‘Are we teaching men that when they are growing up, they will have to deal with the problems that appear on the screen?’
Kitt feels that television may be partly responsible for toxic masculinity, thanks to its much more male-dominated character.
He further said: 'What happens and what is taught?
From what is taught on TV and on the street, young boys begin to believe that to be a man they must do certain things?
In my opinion, this has become one of the big questions of our time - how can we change that?
Because it is obvious that something has gone wrong for young men’s thoughts.”
In an interview, he also admitted that when the Game of Thrones series comes back at the end of next summer, he will not participate in any of its prequels or sequels, as well as, he said that he has done a number of programs with 'war plains and horse riding'.
From November, Kit will be working on Sam Shepard's new series of True West, which is the story of a film producer whose brother is a robber.
Recently, the actor revealed that the best thing that happened to him from Game of Thrones is his meeting with his wife Rose.
“Through this show, I got my spouse, so I believe this show has given me my future family and my life has moved on from here.”
Rose has played the role of Ygret, the girlfriend of John Snow, who plays Kitt in the Emmy Award winning fantasy series.
In June 2018, the couple got married with family consent in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: According to the report, there has been a 14% increase in new cases in China
China has announced that there has been a 14% increase in people living with HIV and AIDS in the country.
Health officials said more than 820,000 people across the country are suffering from the disease.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, around 40,000 new cases were reported.
Given the changes that have taken place in recent times, most of the new cases are being attributed to sex.
Traditionally, HIV is spreading rapidly in some parts of China due to an infected blood infection.
At a conference in Yunnan province, Chinese health officials said the number of people suffering from HIV through it had almost zero.
However, the number of people suffering from HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 every year.
HIV infection from sex performed by China's LGBT community is a serious problem.
In 1997, homosexuality was promoted in China, but the LGBT community is said to be quite discriminatory against people.
Studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Because of many infections of the disease, these relationships have insufficient protection against sex.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has tried to solve the problem, for which every person has been promised that they will be given access to HIV medicine.
Maxine Waters denied that her employees had leaked the data of the GOP Senator, describing it as a "dangerous lie" and "a way of conspiring."
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters called the allegations on Saturday "unfortunate," adding that one of her employees had posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. Senators on the Locker's Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the claims were being investigated by "Ultra-Right Wing" pundits and websites.
Waters tweeted, “Truth, lies, and so much hate.”
The information allegedly included the addresses and phone numbers of South Carolina Senator Lindsay Graham and two Utah Senators Mike Lee and Orin Hatch's home.
The information, which was seen online on Thursday by an unidentified person posted by Capitol Hill, came after a Senate panel hearing was underway on sexual misconduct charges against the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Kavanagh was being questioned over the leak of some information of three senators.
Hill says the address trick of IP addresses identified from conservative sites such as Gateway Punit and RedState that identify the source of the person who posted it was reported that the source was linked to a Waters office and that this information was issued by a Waters employee.
"This allegation is completely baseless, false and absolutely false," Waters said.
"Any of my employees - whose identities, personal information and security are being jeopardized because of these false and false allegations - were in no way responsible for the leak of this information."
This allegation is baseless, totally false and absolutely false.”
Waters soon posted online to clean up criticism, including the former White House press secretary.
Fletcher wrote, “The reason for this rejection is anger.”
"It shows that their nature is not the same as that of a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something, they should not get angry and do it.
They should not be rebels.
They should not question the person who has made the allegations.
They should be calm and patient.”
It seemed that Fletcher Waters' response was being compared by condemning the Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being very angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro also tweeted his thoughts on Twitter to defeat Waters in the midterm elections.
He tweeted, "If it's true, that's a big deal."
In his statement, Waters reported that his office had alerted the appropriate authorities and the law enforcement units to these claims of fraud.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators will be told or not, and that they will be considered legally liable for all the actions they have done that are very bad and dangerous for any and all of my employees,” he said.
Johnny English Strikes Again Review - The act of spying by Rowan Atkinson was not considered to be too strong
The importance of Brexit in any new film from the British perspective is still traditionally seen and seems to apply to this revival of Johnny English's action-comedy spoof franchise, which began with Johnny English in 2003 and brought it back in 2011 under the name Johnny English Reborn.
Will we be self-satisfying on the subject of how we certainly consider talking nonsense on the nation's new export opportunity?
At any rate, pop-eyed and rubber-faced incompetent Johnny English has his license to recreate baseless footwear – something that is more famous than anything else just by its name – is a widespread comic creation for areas where people who don’t speak English live.
He is certainly the scumbag secret agent who managed to show a little bit of Mr Bean's dash cluso despite his quirky fanfare at the Smoothie Glamour and is a dolp for the chap who contributed a single note to Fire Theme Tune's Chariot at the London 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony.
He is originally a traveler and is the International Man Atkinson of Mystery whose role in Barclaycard TV commercials was forgotten except for Wake's Chaos.
In this new JE outing, only one or two good scenes can be seen.
I liked Johnny English quite a bit, with armored medieval suits showing up in helicopters and wrapping rotor blades on his helmet.
Performing a physical comedy on the screen is a kind of gift to Atkinson, but the laughter was very low and the odd kind of half-empty, especially the 007 and the "best" film brands like Mission Impossible present themselves with full confidence as a component of the comedy.
Laughter comes as if the comedy is not for adults but for children, and Johnny English’s strange misunderstandings are not at all tolerable to me, and Bean is more liked by me in Atkinson’s silent-film.
What is always relevant right now is that there is a serious crisis in Great Britain.
The most secretive network of UK spies has been hacked by a cyber-hacker, identifying all UK working agents on this network that could affect the agent’s work – this is a tragic incident for Kevin Alden.
This is the last resort for the brilliant and quite upset Prime Minister, they are already struggling with many political and unpopular issues: Emma Thompson can play this queasy-teresa-me character well, but the script is not strong enough to work on this script.
His intelligence advisers told him that every working spy had entered into an agreement with him, he would have to bring someone who had already retired.
In this way it meant that Johnny English would have to fight himself, now a school master at a posh institute, but he has to work apart from the record on how an undercover operative should be: it has some good humour stories, as well as, teaching English at a rock-type academy school by a detective.
English has been sent back to the emergency Whitehall for briefings and Ben Miller's re-play has been mixed up with his much-loved old sidekick buff.
Now that Boff is married, she is trying to become a submarine commander, her role is played by Jolly-Hockey-Sticks in which Vicky Pepperdine has not been able to freeze.
Therefore, in the secret service of her Majesty, Batman and Robin get some very big mistakes when they encounter Olga Kruelenko's beautiful Fame cracked Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is in danger of coming to terms with the Kersimatic Technical Billionaire who claims to have a solution to Britain’s computer crises: the sinful Jason Volta played the role of Jake Lacey.
English and Bog start their Odyssey of the Fertile Hi-jinks: Working as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they smuggle through Volta’s expensive boat; and English perfectly activates chaos when it tries to use Volta’s home interior as a virtual hedge.
The film has certainly been drawn everywhere for that last sequence, but it is still fine and entertaining, with plenty of fun things for kids throughout the film.
The right middle-class.
Also, as I saw in other Johnny English films, in this film, I did not understand whether Rowan Atkinson should be given a role that really suits his talent in the British film industry.
Labour has denied that it plans to work only four days a week for the people of the UK, but will get the money in five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering becoming a democratic plan, in which UK residents will have to work only four days a week - but the money will be paid in five days.
The party reportedly wants the owners of the company to give the workers part of the savings through Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution so that they can get an extra day off.
This will give the employee a three-day leave per week - but they will still be able to get the same pay.
Sources said such an idea would be "enhanced" with the party's economic agenda and plan to benefit the country's workers.
Trade Union Congress is promoting a four-day shift in the week so that workers can take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour party employee from The Sunday Times said: 'The policy review is likely to be announced before the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but it is expected to take a four-day work week, which is in line with the party's overall industrial strategy as well as the party's vision of rebalancing the economy in favour of workers.
With the Green Party promising a four-day working week during the 2017 general election campaign, the Labour Party will not be the first party to support such an idea.
However, at present this demand is not being fully supported by the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesperson said: 'The four-day working week is not party policy and is not being considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to present his view of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he had a firm intention to regain power in utility firms from "faceless directors" and "counters."
Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that existing shareholders in water companies cannot get back their full shareholding as the Labour government can "cut" on the basis of alleged wrongdoings.
He also confirmed plans to create an inclusive ownership fund to include employees on the company's boards and hand over 10 percent of equities to private sector firms for employees who can receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy, tells "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change his mind
The FBI investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and the question arises whether the bureau's findings helped a Republican senator withdraw his support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pele asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham whether the FBI was likely to find something that would inspire them to change their minds.
Kennedy looked more cynical than his South Carolina ally.
"I think so," Kennedy said.
"I said I was going to the hearing and I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
After this happened, when the allegation surfaced, I called them, asking, ‘Did you do that?’
They were sure, determined, clear."
Graham's vote, however, seemed to be a stone-throwing line.
"I had made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and it would have required an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett denied it in a thorough manner," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And they could not verify whatever name they had taken.
This is 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it reduced poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual concert with many highly influential stars performing, and equally impressive its mission; ending the world’s poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Great Lawn of Central Park at the Global Citizen Festival will not only attract tens of thousands of people to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the true goal of the program to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival, an international advocacy group, is an extension of the Global Power Project, which hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the program (except when you’re not ready to pay a VIP ticket), you’ll need to complete “actions” in a number of ways, such as emailing a world leader, making phone calls, or other meaningful ways, to help those going to concerts create awareness about your goal of poverty.
But how successful has the global citizen been in the remaining 12 years to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people through free concerts the right way to persuade people to call for action, or is just another case of so-called "climaticism" - making people feel like they're really making a difference by signing an online petition or sending tweets?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters while pushing efforts to various goals.
It says these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion set to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its actions, at least $10 billion of which are already distributed or fundraising.
The group estimates that the safe fund has had a direct impact on about 649 million people around the world so far.
Some of the key commitments include, The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based involvement of investors and implementers who are committed to "helping children grow to their full potential," promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to end malnutrition in the county after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the help of global citizens like the UK government, donors, national government, and you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote to history," said Tracy Ulman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project called Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
A frequently asked question on your website is “Why do you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?” in response to
The Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and hard road - sometimes we will fall and fail."
But, just like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janet Monai are among the few performers to perform at this year's event in New York, hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. may use the Navy for "blocking" Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
According to the Washington Examiner, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed that Washington could resort to the U.S. Navy "if necessary" to stop Russian energy in U.S. markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke alleged that Russia's work in Syria - in particular, where it is operating at the invitation of a legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason for their presence in the Middle East is because they want to leverage energy, as they have done in the southern part of Europe, Eastern Europe," he said.
And, according to the officer, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability to ensure with our navy that the sea routes remain open, and, if necessary, blockade, to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing the attendees of the event organized by the Consumers Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself the "voice of energy consumer" in the US.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying they are effectively the same.
Referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels, he said, "The economic option, more or less, in the case of Iran and Russia, is to exploit and replace fuel."
Statements are coming that the Trump administration, replacing Russia, is on a mission to boost its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe as the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that extent, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to pull out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, according to Trump, which, according to him, has made Berlin a "ban" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity from 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's widespread opposition to the project is motivated only by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September, “I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of pressure and consumers should be able to select suppliers.”
The US approach was opposed by Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry body, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
The head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), Dieter Kempf, said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, "I have great trouble when a major state interferes with our energy supply.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" the matter of running for president in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would "seriously consider" the presidential race after the midterm elections.
During the Town Hall in Hollyock, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider participating in the race.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington and join our broken government and that includes having a woman in the top post,” he said.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider contesting for the presidency."
Warren, while assessing President Donald Trump during the Town Hall, said, "They're taking this county in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned from within about what Donald Trump is finally doing for our democracy," he said.
Warren has been vocal in criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said “Of course we need to get the FBI checked before the vote.”
However, a survey released on Thursday showed that most of Warren’s constituents don’t think they should contest the 2020 election.
According to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe Poll, 85 percent of Massachusetts' "potential" voters said Senators should not contest elections.
Thirty-two percent supported the election in this way.
The survey showed greater support for former governor Deval Patrick's candidacy for the election, with 38 percent supporting a possible run for office and 48 percent opposed it.
Other high-profile Democratic names likely to contest the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin cites Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being recruited into the military in September.
He was arrested in a domestic violence case on Monday night
At a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma, he told the audience, “I sympathize with other families who feel the impact of PTSD and the wounds with which our soldiers come back.”
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other retired soldiers, "They return with little change, they come back harshly, they return wondering if this honor is for him who has sacrificed for the country by his fellow soldiers and aircraft-drivers, and every other member of the army."
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasila police department, she was arrested in Wasila, Alaska on Monday and charged with domestic violence and possession of weapons while drunk.
18 States, D.C. Support the Challenge of New Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a new U.S. policy that refuses to shelter victims of gang-rape or domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 states and districts filed a justice-friendly summary in Washington on Friday to support a refugee who challenged the policy.
The full name of the plaintiff has not been disclosed in the Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August.
She said her partner "and the members of her violent gang" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
Government prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as nations facing widespread problems of gang and domestic violence, creating a large number of applicants for U.S. refugees.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 ruling by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed unorganized immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Attorney General of the District of Columbia Carl Resin said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal, and international law."
"The federal law requires that all asylum claims be judged on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and that such an infraction violates that principle," he said.
The attorney further argued in the abstract that the policy denying the entry of immigrants harms the U.S. economy by saying that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "supply essential labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to provide shelter to victims of domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
In its June 11 policy announcement, Sessions said, “There is shelter available for those who leave their home country due to persecution or fear due to their caste, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group.”
Refugees were never meant to alleviate all the problems – even all the serious problems – that people face every day around the world.
The death toll in the race to find the survivors has doubled as a result of intense rescue efforts in Palu.
For the survivors, the situation was extremely serious.
"It sounds extremely stressful," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, consoled the child suffering from bukhara in the exit center of the town of Tahas-Nahs Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance brings dead bodies.
Clean water is rare."
The residents were seen returning to their ruined houses, carrying submerged goods, trying to save whatever they found.
Hundreds of people were injured in the 7.5 magnitude earthquake and hospital sank.
Some injured people, including Dwi Haris, who were experiencing broken back and shoulder, rested outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated in the open outside due to frequent strong earthquake tremors.
His eyes filled with tears as he felt the tremors of a violent earthquake in his fifth floor hotel room shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I think, I was buried in the ruins of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that her family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then silence."
I don't know what happened to him and my son.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of 'threaten' by 'publicity ads'
A week after China's U.S. ambassador ran a four-page ad, referring to the mutual benefits of U.S.-Chinese trade, in a U.S. daily newspaper, Beijing accused the U.S. press of using propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday - after China accused him of trying to meddle in the November 6 congressional elections - referred to China Daily's paid supplement in Iowa's best-selling newspaper - the Des Moines Register, a charge China denies.
Trump's allegation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US elections, US officials told Reuters that there was a new phase in Washington's campaign to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a growing trade war that has seen them go round imposing customs duties on each other's imports.
Chinese and U.S. experts say that China's retaliatory customs in the trade war were first designed to blow up exporters in states like Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican party.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and a longtime former governor of Iowa, major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad expressed his opinion in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, writing that China is “doubling that bullying now by running propaganda ads in our own independent press.”
"In its propaganda, by giving paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's cherished tradition of freedom of speech and independent journalism," Branstad wrote.
"Given that the media is locked in a strong fist of the Chinese Communist Party, in contrast, here at the roadside newsstand in Beijing, you will find limited dissenting voices and will not see any true reflection of the inconsistent opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's worrying economic curve line," he wrote.
He said that "one of China's most prominent newspapers avoided excuses from publishing his article", though he did not name the newspaper.
Republicans are isolating women voters ahead of mid-term elections with Kavanaugh's defeat, analysts warn
Since top Republicans are backing and defending Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, facing multiple allegations of sexual assault, the analyst has warned they will see a reaction, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions around it are quite overwhelming, and most Republicans are already showing on record that they want to move forward with the vote.
Those things can't be brought back," Grant Rehar, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Rihar said he suspected that pressure at the last minute by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to conduct a FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women can't forget what happened yesterday - neither tomorrow nor November," said Carrien Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the Progressive Group MoveOn, according to a Washington D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, when Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee wanted to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, protesters at the Senate's hallway shouted "November is coming!", Mick reported.
Stu Rothenberg, a non-political analyst, told the news site, “Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to move away from the chart.”
"People are saying it's already huge; it's true.
But it could be more, especially dolls between female voters from suburbs and 18-to-29-year-old young voters who often don’t vote when they don’t like the president.”
Explaining in detail the allegations of sexual harassment by Ford against a nominee of the Supreme Court, analysts had said before public testimony that there was a possibility of opposition if Republicans proceed with confirmation.
According to NBC News, former chairman of the Republican National Committee Michael Steele said, “It has become a puzzling mess for the GOP.”
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or the cavana being put on the bench, it's also about how Republicans have handled it and how they've dealt with them," Guy Cecil, the director of the Democratic presidential campaign, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided on who to believe in in the wake of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, most of whom are in favor of Kavanaugh.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believed in certain or potentially Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they believed in certain or potentially Cavana.
Additionally, 38 percent said they felt Kavanaugh had probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations levelled by Ford as well as, at least one other Ferrari, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, swearing that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleged that the nominee of the Supreme Court displayed her genitals when she joined a party while studying in Yale in 1980.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new internet against Google and Facebook
World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee has launched a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Technology Legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what information people will be allowed to access.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is to achieve "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
This may include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and business tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser and at the same time.
The unique thing about personal online data stores is that it entirely depends on the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
According to the company's CEO John Bruce, Inrupt's idea is to bring resources, processes, and appropriate skills by the company so that Solid can be made available to everyone.
The company currently includes a security platform purchased by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, some on-staff developers contracted to work on the project, and the community of Volunteer Coders.
From this week, technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said she and her team "are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to initiate a complete transformation, where all their business models will end up overnight."
"We are not asking for permission from them."
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even when launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic for this next era of the web," Berners-Lee said.
Bernard von: WW1 Victoria Cross Clarice Celebrated
The Church of England's only clergyman who won the Victoria Cross as a warrior during World War I celebrated 100 years in his home town.
Lt. Col. Reverend Bernard von won the award in the September 29, 1918 attacks in Bellingis and Lehighcourt.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper and he never knew he had won the highest British military honor.
The memorial stone was unveiled by his two ships at a parade held in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vaughan, said it was "excellently symbolic" that the plateau was being unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the prize.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt. Col. Vaughan led his battalion at Canal de Saint-Quentin "between a very dense fog, under heavy shelling and machine guns on the battlefield."
They later proceeded to the firing line and, with "great gallantry," led the military-line and dashed three detachments before taking the field-gun in hand alone.
On October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended, Lt. Col. Von was killed by a German sniper.
Michael Vaughan, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “some that I know can never be equated, but which we are disgusted with.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vaughan, also garlanded after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vaughan said he "feels very honoured to play the role in the parade" and said "the support being given by many is demonstrating the heroism of a real hero."
MMA fans stayed awake all night to watch the Bellator 206, but instead they got the Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stayed awake all night to watch the full Bellator 206, but were deprived of watching the main event.
San Jose's bill had 13 contestants, including six on the main card and was being shown live throughout the night on UK Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gaguard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were stunned by the turn of the coverage into the Peppa Pig.
They were very disappointed, especially after waking up early in the morning for the match.
A fan on Twitter described switching to children's cartoons as "a kind of sick joke."
When asked about the broadcast, Ballator’s Senior Vice President Dave Schwartz said, “This material was not suitable for 6 a.m. as per government regulation, so they had to switch to children’s programming.”
"Peppa the pig, yes."
Scott Cocker, president of the Ballator Company, said they are going to work on their scheduling to include UK audiences in the future.
"I think when I think of Replay, I think we'll probably find a solution," Cocker said.
"But then there will be Sunday morning at six o'clock and we will not be able to work on Sundays, our time, Mondays until their time."
But we are working on it.
Believe me, there was a lot of text movement when this change took place and they were not all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it was not, it was a government issue.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We'll limit it to five instead of six -- like we usually do -- and that's just a bit too much when we tried to deliver something more for fans.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Disc: Tom Daly feels 'lack' of sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daly says he grew up with a low sense of belonging to everyone because of his sexuality - but that inspired him to succeed.
The 24-year-old Daily said she didn’t realize until she reached secondary school that “not everyone is like me.”
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island disc presented by Lauren Lavern, she said she talks about gay rights to "hope" on others.
She also said that she was less concerned about winning the Olympics when she became a father.
Cursty Young, the regular presenter of the long-running show, has taken several months off due to illness.
On appearing as a social-choice person at Lavern’s first program, Daly said she felt “low” in herself than everyone else because “like boys and girls was not socially acceptable.”
She said: “Even today, those feelings of feeling inferior to others, and feeling different, are the real things that have given me strength and strength to be able to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was also a “fan,” she said, so that he wouldn’t disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic medallist has become a high-profile LGBT campaigner and used his presence at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to reduce homosexuality.
She said she spoke openly because she felt lucky to be able to live freely without any trouble and wanted to "hope" others.
The three-time world champion said that a male - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - when he fell in love with - "I was surprised."
Daly married an Oscar winner who is 20 years older than her, but she said age gap was never an issue.
"When you go through so many experiences at such a young age" - he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone of our age who had experienced the fluctuation of similar experiences at such a young age.
In June, the couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daily said his "whole approach" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it would have all been related to 'I need to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know, there's a lot more to it than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son's name is similar to his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daly said his father did not admit that he was going to die and that the last thing he wanted to know was whether he had London 2012 tickets - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
She said, “I couldn’t tell them you wouldn’t be sitting in the front row, Dad.”
He said, “When they were unable to breathe, I held their hands and held them until their breathing stopped and they were dead, so I went and found that they were not invincible.”
The following year, Daly participated in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"All I knew was that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - there was no better feeling than diving in front of the nation's crowd at the Olympic Games," she said.
It also inspired his favorite first song - Pride by Heather Small - that resonated with him during his preparation for the Olympics and that still resonates with him.
The Desert Island Disc will air on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out-of-form Mickelson out of Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to change his form to avoid it becoming an unfortunate milestone.
Playing in the biennial event for the record for the 12th time, Mickelson was knocked out of the game by captain Jim Furick for Saturday's Foreballs and Forsom.
Instead of becoming a center of attraction, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time major winner spent his day among cheerleaders and working in hopes of improving the weaknesses of his playing style.
Never driving straight to the peak of his career, the 48-year-old has never been an ideal fit for the Tight Le Golf National Course, where those who have not been active for a long time are routinely punished with wrong shots.
And while the course isn't that easy, in Sunday's ninth match, Mickelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with Rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all his four matches this week.
If the American players, starting with four points down in 12 singles matches, start hard, Mickelson's match can prove to be very important.
Fury expressed confidence in his man, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood his role, slapped my back and encircled me in my arms and said they would be ready tomorrow," he said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is the Hall of Famer and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I didn't expect him to play two games.
I had imagined more, but it worked the way it was and the way we thought we would have to move on.
He wants to get out there just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for the most-played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
This Ryder Cup could mark the end of a career that has never touched the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson has scored 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven half-centuries, although Furick said his presence brings some intimacy to the team.
"He's funny, he's satirical, he's funny, he likes to make fun of people, and his presence in the team room is special," he explained.
"I think the young players also enjoyed going to them, this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than just playing."
Europe's captain Thomas Bjorn knows the big lead could disappear soon
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from his experience that a pretty big lead in the last day's singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable move.
Dane made his first appearance in a 1997 match at Valderama, where a side under the captaincy of Seave Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but with a victory of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2, with the lowest margins, just reached the finish line.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderama; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we were defeated, and in Valderama, we were just able to win," said Björn, after watching the 2018 class from Friday 5-3 and yesterday's 10--6 lead at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and all the people on that team that it is not over.
You'll pay the full price tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
It doesn't end until you get points on the board.
We have a goal, and that's trying to win this trophy and that's where to keep the focus.
I have always said, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are well aware that the greatest players around the world are standing on the other side."
Björn went on to explain how his players performed on a tough golf course: "In this I will never be able to outrun myself.
Tomorrow is a different hard time.
Tomorrow's individual performances will come forward, and that's a different thing.
It’s great to go there with a partner when everything is going well, but when you get out there in person, your potential as a golfer is thoroughly tested.
This is the message you need to convey to the players to showcase your best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind and he has to go and give his best."
Unlike Björn, opposite standing Jim Furick would have been hoping for a better performance for his players personally than what he did as a partner, with the exception being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Before facing defeat due to Europe’s showing of “miracles in the Medina”, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn, Furic himself has been on both sides of the replay of those big final days.”
"I remember every inch of him," he said in response to a question about how captain Ben Cranshaw handled his players on the last day in 1999.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'll want to start as fast as you saw in Brooklyn, like you saw in Medina.
When this speed is one-sided, it puts a lot of pressure on the matches between them.
We set our line-up on our own and included people like this, as we felt, you know, we’re trying to do some more miracles tomorrow.”
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead a counterattack with Rory McLarero in the top match, where Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polter are the top half of the other European order.
"I made these groups in this order because I think it covers all," Björn said of his solo selections.
Germany's new warship has been put on hold again.
New German Navy warships should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the time-influenced Cold War-era warships, but due to faulty systems and fast-growing costs, that won't happen until at least next year, local media reported.
The commissioning of the "Reinland-Puffalz", which is the flagship ship of the brand new Baden-Württemberg-class warships, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to a military spokesman.
The vessel should have joined the Navy in 2014, but issues troubling after delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Württemberg class ships were ordered back by the Navy in 2007 to be brought back as replacements for the time-influenced Bremen-class warships.
It is understood that they will feature powerful cannons, an array of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth techniques such as low radar, infrared and acoustic division.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period - it is possible to deploy the latest warships from indigenous ports for up to two years.
However, the continued delay means that the state-of-the-art warships - which could give Germany the opportunity to power projects abroad - will be time-consuming until the period of entry into service, Die Zein commented.
The dreaded F125 warship made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned the Bloom and Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the ship's manufacturer after delivery.
Very few people knew the reasons for the withdrawal, but the German media cited several important “software and hardware defects” that would render the warship useless when deployed on a war mission.
The shortcomings of the software were particularly significant as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors - only half of the manpower of the old Bremen class warships.
In addition, it also emerged that the ship is dramatically overweight which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne "Rhinland-Pfalz" is thought to be twice as heavy as the same class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the price tag of the entire project - including crew training - is becoming an issue.
It is said that it has reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6bn) from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problem of new warships, which have become particularly important in light of recent warnings, is tightening Germany's naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the defense committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the Navy was actually "ending tens of thousands of capable ships."
The official said the issue has become serious over time as the old ships were removed from use but no replacement ships were made available.
He said none of the Baden-Württemberg-class warships were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust is listening to the secret lives of bats.
New research being conducted in an estate in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the natural landscape in their prey for food.
It is expected that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of unique mammals flying and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by scientists at the National Trust of Scotland, will follow common and soprano pipesters, as well as brown long-eyed and doubenton bats settled in Weston Ross's Inverway Garden.
Special recorders will be installed at key locations around the estate to track the activities of bats throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings shows the frequency of bat calls and what species are doing.
A detailed landscape of their behavior will then be mapped and reported for illustration.
Rob Dever, NTS's Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes the results will reveal which areas of natural habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of natural- habitat management functions such as the construction of grasslands and how to maintain woodlands well for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and across the UK has declined significantly in the last century
They are threatened by construction and development works, which affect the nests of birds and damage natural habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose risks, as some chemical treatments of flypaper and building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats, can pose a risk.
Bats are not really blind.
However, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey because of their hunting habits.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to indicate defects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained specialists, who regularly survey, inspect the nests of birds and sometimes save them.
The organization has established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve in the Three Estates of Dumfries and Galway, Scotland, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Estate manager David Thompson says the estate is the best place for him.
"We've got a great area for bats here in the three," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees, and all good natural habitats.
But there is so much about bats that is still unknown, so the work we do here and in other assets will help us understand what they need to thrive.”
They emphasize the importance of testing bats before maintaining them within the estates, as it is possible that 400 women and children could be destroyed by the destruction of the maternity maternity shelter in the unintentional way, potentially eliminating the entire local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, taunt or harass them or destroy their bases.
The Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, Elizabeth Farrell, has encouraged the public to come forward to help.
He said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and about many of our species we still don’t know how their population is growing.”
Ronaldo refutes rape claims, while lawyers sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called rape claims against him "false news", saying people "want to propagate themselves" using his name.
His lawyer is due to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus Forward are accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Derry Spiegel reported on Friday that she allegedly paid $375,000 to the woman to keep quiet about the incident.
Addressing his 142 million followers in an Instagram live video after reporting claims, 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
"What he said today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said in the camera.
"They want to propagate themselves using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be popular with my name, but that’s part of their job.
I'm a happy person and all is well," the player smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel for the charges, according to Reuters, which he has called "suspicious invalid reporting in the area of privacy."
Lawyer Christian Shertz said the players would "require compensation for moral damage in amounts consistent with the severity of the breach, which is possibly one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 at a suite of Pams Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to papers filed in Nevada's Clark County District Court, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where they allegedly raped her.
Meyerga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99 percent" a "good person" whose "one percent" has disappointed.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the pair had had sex, but there was mutual consent for it.
Mayerga also claims that she went to the police and also photographed her injuries at a hospital, but later agreed to an agreement outside the court as she felt "scared of retribution" and was concerned about being "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to scrap the deal as she continues to be harassed since the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and struck a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal with Italian giant Juve this summer.
Brexit: UK 'will forever regret the loss of a carmaker'
Trade Secretary Greg Clark said the U.K. will "forever regret" if it loses its title as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit.
He said that Toyota UK had told the BBC that it would temporarily halt production at its factory in Bernstone near Derby if Britain left the European Union.
"We need a deal," Mr Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the border delay could have an impact on jobs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The Burnstone plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
“I believe that if Britain exits the EU at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory,” said Marvin Cook, managing director of Toyota in Bernstone.
Other UK carmakers have expressed apprehensions about leaving the EU without consensus on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will shut down its mini plant for a month after Brexit in Oxford.
According to car manufacturers, the main concerns are related to the risk of supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line runs on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts of made-to-order cars arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the European Union.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without a deal, disruptions on the border could occur, according to the industry that could lead to delays and spares shortages.
The company said it would be impossible for Toyota to have more than a day's inventory at its Derbyshire plant, so production would be stopped.
Mr Clarke said Theresa May's checkers plan for future ties with the EU had been "calibrated purely to avoid those checks at the border."
“We need a deal. We want a great deal that I think can not only enjoy success in the present, but also what is necessary to achieve this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
“There’s evidence from not only Toyota but other manufacturers that we should be able to fully carry on with what has been a highly successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be stopped, but in the long run, warned that additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually leave jobs.
Peter Sauvaleris, who has worked in Bernston for 24 years and is the convener of the Unite Union at the plant, said his members are highly concerned: “In my experience once these jobs are gone, they never come back after in Baid.
An official spokesman said: “We have put forward an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the European Union.”
According to the White House, Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again.
The White House said Sunday Donald Trump's high-stakes meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed for "another week later" as the battle for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, the relationship between Trump Assistant and Russia, and the possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will remove the deputy attorney general, and endanger Mueller's independence, the news has heated up Washington's rumored market for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of installing a wire to record conversations with Trump and removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein refuted the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House amid reports that he is about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "wouldn't like" Rosenstein's removal but then delayed the meeting to avoid confrontation with a hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee that had both testified to Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual misconduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into claims against Kavanaugh, delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "The date for this has not been set, it could be this week, I can see that the eye on all other cases going on with the Supreme Court can be pushed one more week forward."
But we'll see and I always like to keep the press updated."
Some journalists have claimed: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of briefings was not due to the TV reporters' disapproval of the "perception", though he said: "I do not disagree with the fact that they are grand."
He then suggested increasing direct contact between Trump and the press.
“The president does more Q&A sessions than any other president,” she said, not citing evidence: “We have seen those numbers.”
The briefing will still take place, Sanders said, but "If the press has a chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it's better than talking to me."
We try very hard to do this and you have seen us doing so a lot over the last few weeks and when you can talk to the President of the United States he is going to replace the press conference.”
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or at a press conference with dignitaries.
Single press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the President demonstrated to the present journalists the unmistakable and often unique presence, perhaps demonstrating why.
Health Secretary NHS writes to EU workers in Scotland about Brexit fears
The health secretary has written to EU employees working at Scotland's NHS, expressing the country's gratitude and their desire to remain after Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months after the UK withdrew from the European Union.
The Scottish Government is committed to meeting the costs of the application of settlement status for EU citizens already working in its devolved public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: “In the summer, the interplay between the UK and the EU continued, heading towards the expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government is also advancing its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this will be a very uncertain time for all of you.
That is why I now wanted to reiterate how much I value their contribution, regardless of the nationality of each staff member.
The EU, and beyond, brings together valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we very much want you to stay here.”
Christian Abercrombie's emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercromby, who lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodore on Saturday, underwent emergency surgery following a head injury, Tennessee Mike Organ said.
Tennessee state head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before Hoftime.
"He came to the shore and just fell there," Reid said.
The trainers and medical personnel oxygenated Abercrombie on the sideline before placing her on the stretcher and taking her back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee state official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Aberdromby had been out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said "no details are available on the type/limit of the injury yet" and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, the redshirt sophomore, is in its first season with the state of Tennessee after moving from Illinois.
He scored a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, making his season a total of 18 tackles.
High stamp duty will be charged from foreign buyers while buying property in the UK
When foreign buyers buy property in the UK, they will be charged high stamp duty, which will be used to help the homeless under the new Tory schemes.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters.
Increased stamp duty will be levied on those who are not paying tax in the UK
The Treasury expects it to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people
Preparations are underway to charge higher stamp duty rates on buying property in the UK from foreign buyers - the additional cash that will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May will announce today.
The move is being seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign, which attracts young voters with the promise of providing more affordable housing and targeting high-income earners.
The stamp duty hike will be imposed on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the additional money that will boost the government's campaign to deal with those who fall asleep under adverse circumstances.
surcharge - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, which includes two houses started two years ago and rental purchases, can be a maximum of three percent.
The Treasury is expected to grow to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly-created London properties are purchased by non-UK residents, leading to a rise in prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to set foot on the housing ladder.
Many of the country's wealthier regions - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" as the number of foreign buyers is high, who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp duty cut to help more young people build their first home.
He accused large construction firms of grabbing lands but not using them to boost property prices, and urged Mrs May to drop quotas on affordable homes to fix Britain's "housing disorder."
Mr Corbyn has announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including fare control and an end to "no-fault" disputes.
They want to give more rights to councils for the construction of new houses.
Ms May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my premiere to restoring the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our scattered housing market.
The UK will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, this is not true that it is as easy for non-residents in the UK as well as foreign-based companies to buy a home for hard-working British residents.
For many people the dream of owning a house has become a very distant thing, and the fury of gold in odd circumstances is extremely real.”
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "last ambition" is to become a Scottish manager at some point.
Scott, 42, is reiterating the challenge of reviving the North-East club, who is currently third in League One, and who is three points away from the top.
They moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St. Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last year.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got the B cap and that's all," Ross told the BBC Scotland's SportsSound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father from childhood, and it's always been something that pulls me back.
This opportunity will come only when I succeed in club management.”
Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet, and Paulo de Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic boss says he did not feel nervous following established names in a big club that had previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's initiative.
“For me right now, success can be gauged from whether I can return this club to the Premier League.”
Due to the structure and features of this club, it undoubtedly comes in the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get there, but I’ll probably see myself as successful here if I can get the club there.”
After 15 months as an assistant boss at Dumbarton and 15 months as a Harts coaching staff, Ross’ management career has only been three years.
He then helped Eloa recover from the downfall of the third tier, and turned St. Mirren from the edge of the downfall of the championship title winners in the next season.
And Ross says they feel more comfortable now than they did during their careers at Clyde, Hartalpool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
In the case of taking over the office of Aloa, he said, “It was probably the real square.”
"I really believed that management was a better fit for me than playing.
It seems odd because I did the right thing, earned a fair amount of money from it, and enjoyed some reasonably highs.
But it can be difficult to play.
On a weekly basis you have to get a lot of things.
I still go through them in terms of job stress and pressure but everything seems to be fine in terms of management.
I always wanted to manage and now I’m doing it, it makes me feel most comfortable throughout my adult life.”

The correct time for a pint is Saturday at 5.30 pm, the survey found
Summer tapas have boosted Britain's struggling pubs, but it has put more pressure on the chain of restaurants.
The pub and bar group saw sales rise by 2.7 percent in July - but restaurant fluctuations were down 4.8 percent, data showed.
Peter Martin, Business Consultancy CGA, which compiles the data, said: “Continuous sunshine and July compared to England’s expected participation in the World Cup meant similar patterns were followed in the month of June last year, when pubs were up 2.8 percent, except that restaurants faced even more difficulties.
Restaurant trade declined by 1.8 per cent in June, further worsening in July.
The pubs and bars that sell alcohol performed the strongest with more liking than restaurants.
Food-driven pubs also suffered in the sun, though not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
It seems that people just wanted to go out to drink.
During the month, the sales of all pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent, while food declined by three per cent.
Paul Newman, leisure and hospitality analyst RSM said: “These results have continued the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events make up the biggest factor for sales in the outdoor market.
It’s no surprise that restaurant groups continued to struggle, although sales fell by 4.8 percent year-on-year, especially due to current cost pressures, would be painful.
The long summer weather could not have been the time and the bad time for food-content operators, and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide the much-needed relief.”
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slower pace in brand roll-out.

One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
The survey shows that one in five children - some of whom are under 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in "fake insta" pages
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account to show their parents.
One in five children - some of whom are under 11 - are creating social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students showed a rapid increase in “fake insta” accounts – a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they operate a clean “main” account to show parents, while they also have a private account.
A mother who suddenly looked at her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found that a teenager in it was urging others to "rape me."
Research from independent schools by Digital Awareness UK and The Headmasters' and Headmasters' Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, half of which were accepted to have private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s very disturbing that a lot of teens are lured to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Elydh Doyle will be the "voice for athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Board
Elidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the Governing Body's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and Chairman Ian Beatty described the move as a great opportunity for those who have guided the sport to benefit from its extensive international experience over the past decade.
“I have a lot of respect for the Scottish, UK and the world athletics community and we are sure that bringing athletics to the board in Scotland will be of great benefit,” Beatty said.
Doyle said: “I’m looking forward to working as the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help guide the game in Scotland.”
In addition to his four Olympic gold medals, Americans who won the 200m and 400m races at the 1996 Games in Atlanta and who are now regular BBC pundits became unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago today I had a stroke.
I cant walk.
The doctors said that time will tell if I will recover or not and to what extent I can be right.
It was a grueling job, but learned to fully recover, walk again and practice agility today!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Comparing mothers to cows by breast pump advertising created differences in the opinion of online people
A breast pump company divided opinions online by an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to milking cow's milk.
To mark the launch of a product called "the world's first silent wearable breast bump," consumer tech company Elvie released a new funny music video-inspired ad, with the new pump giving mothers the freedom to express themselves.
In the grassy barn of cows, four real mothers dance to a song that includes some kind of saying: “Yes, I milk myself, but you don’t see a tail” and “If you haven’t noticed, these are not the thongs, these are my breasts.”
The chorus continues: “Pump It Out, Pump It Out, I Am Feeding Dam Babies, Pump It Out, Pump It Out, I Am Milking My Ladies.”
Whatever it is, the ad, which has been published on the Facebook page of the firm, has caused online controversy.
With over 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the audience, with many saying that it presents lightly the "terribleness" of the dairy industry.
"Using cows for advertising of this product is a very bad decision.
Just like us, they need to be pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them within a few days after they are born," one wrote.
The Elvie breast pump is well-fitted within the nursing bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another comment: “Of course it’s sad for both mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who have the opportunity to have their children?”
Someone else added: “What is irrelevant advertising.”
Others defended the ad, one of which a woman said she found the ad's song "funny."
"I think it's a great idea.
I would have had it too, if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping makes me feel absolutely like a cow.
This ad is a bit weird, but I saw it the way it is.
One wrote: "It's a great product."
Another commented: “It’s a fun ad for mothers who pump (often in their workplace or toilet) and feel like “cows.”
It's not a marketing or advertising that promotes the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reported that they danced by carefully pumping in their bra.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who pump breasts say they feel like they are a cow.
However, the LV pump is well hidden, there is no wire or tube in it and directly fits into a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move around, hold their children and even go outside without pumping.
Anna Ballerin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: "The LV pump is a revolutionary product, entitled to a bangful and spectacular launch.
By underlining the parallels between women and dairy cows, we want to bring breast pumping and its challenges to the spotlight, demonstrating a sense of freedom in an entertaining and related way, which will bring new pumps.
This is not the first time that the LV pump has been in headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children using the product, designer Marta Jacubowski, was seen doing a catwalk.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
Detained migrant children were spied on, even when there was no relative change in the monthly border crossings, to some extent because of the harshness and policies introduced by the Trump administration that made it difficult to recruit children with sponsors.
Traditionally, the maximum sponsors themselves employed immigrants without a document and were afraid to risk their own ability to live in the country by claiming any children ahead of them.
The threat escalated in June, when federal rights announced that potential sponsors and other adults or large members of the household would have to give their fingerprints and the data would then be shared with immigrant authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albanes, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, submitted evidence to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Almost 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the sponsor's household live illegally in the country and the maximum of them are criminals."
So we continue to search for those individuals," Mr. Albens said.
Seeking to quickly prepare the children, the authorities introduced new rules, according to which the children were required to appear before the court within one month of being caught instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard according to the staff who took refuge.
Many appear through video conference calls instead of appearing in person to present their case for legal status before an immigrant judge.
Those who are deemed ineligible for release are immediately fired.
The longer the children remain captive, the more likely they are to remain in captivity or depressed, which can be quantified in violent impulses or attempts to escape, according to conservation staff and system reports in recent months.
Lawyers or advocates said those cases are taken to a higher facility such as Tornillo, where signs that the child is struggling are ignored due to their size.
At the same time, he said that taking the children to the tent town without giving them enough time to be emotionally ready or without saying goodbye to friends would further exacerbate the shock with which they are already struggling.
Syria urges US, Turkish and French forces to withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Maualem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, even when the country was now in its eighth year of war.
Maulam, who also serves as a deputy prime minister, said foreign military forces live illegally on Syrian soil on the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be treated accordingly."
"They should immediately and unconditionally leave the war land," he told the assembly.
He stressed that the "war is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and many millions have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to fight this “supernatural war” until we both cleared all the Syrian territories of terrorist groups and “the presence of a foreigner.”
The United States has some 2,000 military forces in Syria, mainly training and advising both Khurdish and Syrian military forces in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 military forces on land in the country devastated by the war.
On the refugee case, Maulam said conditions were fine for him to return and he blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading fear of harm" that prompted the refugees to stay away.
“We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to simplify this withdrawal,” he said.
"They were politicising a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union warned that Syria would not receive any aid for reconstruction until a political agreement was reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
A recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the stronghold of Idlib's last major uprising creates an opportunity to put further pressure on political negotiations, United States politicians say.
The Russian-Turkish deal or agreement avoided a massive attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province where three million people lived.
However, Maulam said the agreement has a "clear timeline" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from al-Qaeda linked to the Nusra Front, who would be "delivered."
United States Representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon hold the first meeting of a new committee with the government and members of the opposition to prepare a post-war constitution to fix Syria and the electoral path.
Maulam laid down certain conditions in the committee for the participation of the Syrian government, saying that the panel's work should be restricted to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warning against interference.
Why do you think Trump will win in the second term?
With that logic, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020, unless many liberal or elites are expecting a conviction and scandal to end his term prematurely.
"This will undoubtedly be the most dramatic end of the national post ever!"
So far, no fatigue was visible in the audience.
Since 2014, the prime-time rating has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.

Of course, on TV and beyond, stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, the unity of immigrant families and the health of the global economy.
Only the authorized spectators could afford to ignore it.
And yet, it’s beyond being an informed citizen, when you find yourself looking at a six-hour debate of a panel of experts, Woodward uses the root cause of “Deep Background” for his book “Fire,” Paul Manafort’s 15,000-dollar bomber jacket (“a thick cloth with breeches” by Viermee Annette’s Washington Post) and Stormy Daniel’s by the Washington Post.
I'll never see Super Mario again that way.
Brent Montgomery, the creator of Wheelhouse Entertainment and "Pon Stars," said "as part of everything he does, which makes it exactly like a reality show where he brings something new to you every night," which is the rotation cast of Trump's show and the selection of Rose's plot twists (N.F.L.) about a fight.

In the run-up to the election house, there was a flood of external money in the strong middleman.
It was not surprising that Pennsylvania was flooded with money or cash in the 17th, thanks to the re-construction of the Congress chamber, which led to two office-bearers running for the same seat.
Which recently opened the front for the democratic rapist Connor Lamb of the suburban Pittsburgh district – who won his seat in the second district in the special election last spring.
Lamps were also involved in a second term race, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the 12th district of old Pennsylvania, intersecting with the new 17th.
Following this decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January in the case of unconstitutionally forging in favour of the Republicans by the old districts, maps or maps were redrawn.
In the new 17th race, the empty-handed battle between the major finance arms, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) touched the economy of the campaign.
Lamb's name became popular in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory widely seen in the March special election of Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
For this reason, the seat was held by Republicans for almost a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political pundits provoked the democrats a little more.
U.S. punishes El Salvador for backing China, then retreats
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing because of the resistance by Washington.
Mr. Trump held a vigorous meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and stayed in a hotel in Panama until the Trump Organization’s management team fired the partners.
Earlier this month, Department spokesman Heather Nort said in a statement that on the "recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan," State Department officials decided to recall the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama.
But only El Salvador was penalized, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including narcotics control, development, and economic aid.
The proposed penalties, which included cutting financial aid and targeting visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
When progress was made at internal meetings or meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to follow that aggregation or mass following the same as last year, which was seen as a step forward as an attempt to prevent immigrants from leaving the United Nations.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made it clear they wanted the conference to go ahead and effectively end up considering any penalties or penalties for El Salvador.
Politicians said Vice President Mike Pence is now ready to address the conference in a sign of importing administrative locations to the conference, which has now been scheduled for mid-October.
And three Americans returned from Washington silently to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any harsh messages or penalties.
A White House spokesman for Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate or debate described by three U.S. officials, including two politicians who agree to discuss internal discussions on the condition of anonymity.
Their accounts have been confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration as well as speak on the condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next case may be the report of Special Council Robert Mueller on Mr Trump's possible resistance to justice, of which there is now sufficient evidence in public records.
At the same time, according to Mr. Mueller’s report, the direction of his investigation changes if Mr. Trump’s campaign ties with Russia to attack our elections.
When Congress shakes hands, Mr. Trump finds himself accountable in that body when he prepares himself to go to the voters again and perhaps in front of a jury of his co-workers.
That is, a lot if or if and I do not mean to suggest or suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump or his counterparts in Europe is not inevitable.
We all have options to choose from on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the conflict can last.
In 1938, German authorities were ready to take a move against Hitler, only if he was opposed to the West and Czechoslovakians in Munich supported him.
We failed, as a result of which we missed the opportunity to stop the genocide of so many years.
The functioning of the historical centre points around such differentiation points and the undesirable march of democracy are accelerated or delayed.
Americans now face many of these divergence points.
If Mr. Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the person who controls the final outcome of Mr. Mueller's investigation, what would we do?
Rosenstein has been in this dilemma ever since this paper reported it last year, suggesting secretly keeping the president's record and considering his disqualification for office.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times account is not accurate.
"If recently requested Brett Kavanaugh's F.B.I. investigation is not complete or fair - or if he persists in the Supreme Court despite the corroborative allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony, how would we react?"
And above all, will we vote for Congress in the medium term for which Mr. Trump will be responsible?
If we fail in those investigations, democracy will persist for long winters.
But I think we will not fail because of the lessons I learned in Prague.

Graham Doran's rangers are optimistic even after intense Vienna encounters
Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, winning the Austrians would put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europe League.
The knee injury prevents midfielder Graham Roundon from appearing for the first time in a session with Villarreal up to a 2-2 draw, but he believes Rangers can use that result as a springboard for big things.
"It was a good thing for us because Villarreal was good," the 31-year-old said.
"We move into the game with the belief that we can achieve something and reach a conclusion.
Maybe we can achieve it in the end, but overall, the draw will probably be a fair result.
They were probably better in the first period and we came out even better in the second period.
Moving on to Thursday, this is another big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points but it will be a tough game as they get good results with our back crowd or crowd in their previous game, I am sure we will play well and get positive results.
Whatever happened to my injuries and the changes made to the club itself last year was certainly difficult but now there is a good experience in this space.
The Squad is good and the boys are really enjoying it; they’ve got good training.
Hopefully, we can now move forward and succeed by leaving our previous session behind.”
Women are losing their sleep due to the fear of this retirement savings.
Despite the fact that survey participants clearly know what kind of care they need, some people were talking to their family members about it.
More than half of individuals across the country said they were talking to their partner about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent said they spoke to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them or take care of them, but he doesn't take any steps to negotiate," said Holly Cinder, vice president of life insurance business across the country.
Here is where to start.
Talk to your partner and children: You won’t be able to prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t tell them your wishes ahead of time.
Discuss with your advisor and your family where and how to get care, as those options can be important factors in determining costs.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor may also give you tips on how to pay those expenses.
Your funding options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy to help pay these expenses or to insure your own health, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy, as long as you have the money.
Present your legal documents: Make your legal battle easier.
Get a health-care proxy, so that you hire a trusted person to oversee your medical care and make sure that if you are unable to communicate or interact, the professionals follow your wishes.
Also, consider the attorney's authority to inspect your finances.
You will select a trusted person to make financial decisions for yourself and make sure your bills are paid if you are disabled.
Don’t forget the little information: Imagine that your elderly parents have a medical emergency and are taken to the hospital.
So will you be able to answer questions related to their medications and allergies?
Tell that information in a written plan, so that you are ready.

Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city on Friday killed at least 384 people and the death toll is expected to rise further, officials said.
When communication was off, the rescue officers were unable to obtain any information from the Dongla Regency, the northern region of Palu which is near the epicentre of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated in the devastation.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Ghotala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, located on the shore of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami struck, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Dongla is a regency on the beach northwest of Sulawesi Island, which is spread over an area of more than 300 kilometers (180 miles).
The Regency below the administrative province has an estimated population of 299, from 200 in 2017.
The mainstay of the economy of the central Sulawesi province was fishing and farming, especially in the coastal areas of Nagola.
Nickel mining in the province is also very important, but it is concentrated in Moroli on the coasts opposite the maximum Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency, the tsunami has hit Palu and Ghotla several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people died and hundreds of homes were destroyed due to the Tsunami in Nagla.
In 1996, a tsunami struck the western seaboard, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire seismically and regularly suffers earthquakes.
Here's a look at the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake caused a tsunami in 14 countries on the west coast of Indonesia's AK province in northern Sumatra on 26 December, killing 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, half of whom were in AK.
2005: A series of intense earthquakes also struck the western coasts of Sumatra in March and early April.
Hundreds were killed on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude tsunami struck Indonesia's most populous island, Java, activating a tsunami that struck the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake near the city of Padang affected the area, which is the capital of western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake on Menthai Island off the coast of Sumatra affected the area, causing dozens of villages to be devastated and nearly 300 people died in the tsunami that hit an area of up to 10 meters.
2016: A shallow water earthquake in AK strikes Pidi Jaya Regency, causing destruction and stampede as it caused people to remember the destruction or devastation of the 2004 terrible earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of buildings or buildings.
2018: Intensive earthquakes wreaked havoc on Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north direction of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and rendered thousands of tourists helpless for some time.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of East Alaska ruler and deputy presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assaulting.
Palin, 29, from Wasila, Alaska, was arrested on Saturday for tampering with domestic violence reports and resisting arrest, according to a report released by the state of Alaska.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report an alleged crime, she took the phone from him.
According to the KTUU report, Pelin was sent back to the Maut-Sue Pretrial facility as well as fined $500 of unsecured bonds.
The network's report said it appeared before the court on Saturday, where it declared itself "not guilty" when asked for a plea.
Pelin faced three A-class offenders, where he could be sentenced to up to one year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with Class B offences with a one-day prison sentence and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that a criminal case has been registered against Palin.
In December 2017, he was convicted of assaulting his father Todd Pelin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
At present the matter is before the Court of learned persons of Alaska.
In January 2016, she was charged with obstructing reports of domestic violence, domestic violence, and possessing a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend alleged that he punched her in the face.
After linking his son’s violent behavior to PTSD stemming in Iraq, Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of veterans in 2016.
Earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed on Friday after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake activated the tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
In the coming days, along with the increase in mortality, electricity and communication networks were also not working.
The earthquake struck central Sulawesi, the northeastern region of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos showing the impact were circulating on social media.
When the tsunami hit the coast, thousands of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors are demanding a rare death penalty for a NYC attack suspect.
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding a rare death penalty for Saifulo Cypov, a suspect of a terrorist attack on New York City that killed eight people -- a rare punishment given in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Cypov, 30, allegedly uses a home depot rental truck to attack by bike on the way to the western direction highway in Manhattan, cutting pedestrians and cyclists down in October.
According to the notice of intent to demand the death penalty imposed in the southern district of New York, in order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Cypov "deliberately" killed eight victims and "deliberately" injured them physically.
These two countries potentially impose the death penalty according to the court document.
A week after the invasion, a federal grand jury hit Cypov with a chuckle for 22 charges, including eight counts of murder to assist in racketeering, which are used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime and in cases of violence and motor vehicle destruction.
Prosecutors said the attack required "substantial planning and prior deliberations," explaining the manner in which Cypov carried out it in a "hateful, cruel and evil" manner.
"Safulu Haibibulvic Cypov injured and damaged friends and families of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleuss Enlar Decat, Darren Drake, Ariel Allerge, Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Ferrucci, Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Diego Mendoza and Alojandro Paguno," expressed in the report.
Five of the victims were tourists, who were from Argentina.
The trial of the last death penalty case in the South District of New York has been going on for a decade.
Mullazim Khalid Brain was found guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
In 1953, Julius and Ethyl Rosenberg were sentenced to death for the last time in a New York federal case, a married couple who were found guilty of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Joan Rosenberg was sentenced to death by an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Cypov, a local resident of Uzbekistan, had no glaring or remorse for days and months after the invasion, according to court documents.
Police said he told investigators that he liked what he did.
Cypov told officials that he was motivated to attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone encountering a crime.
Police said they also requested to show the ISIS flag in their hospital room.
She pleaded not guilty to the 22-count offence herself.
David Patton is one of the federal public defenders representing Cypov, who says they are "clearly disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We think that our decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting life imprisonment without any possibility of being released would only postpone the mental trauma of these events to include everyone," Patton said.
Cypov's defense team had earlier asked prosecutors not to seek death penalty.
Tory MP Says Nigel Farage Should Be Charged For Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to "collect an army of people" during the protest at the Tory Conference.
The Eastern U.K. leader asked politicians to "understand" the month from Euroscaptics - because Theresa May, one of May's own MPs, suggested they should negotiate with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bonn told March in Birmingham that if Mr. Faraz was Brexit secretary, Britain would have been 'out by now'.
But the challenges faced by Mrs May in addressing her highly divided ranks are underscored by pro-Remain Tory to add a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
Premier Brexiteer is struggling to keep his checkered compromise plan on track during attacks from the EU, Reuters and Reuters.
The allies urged that they would try to make a deal with Brussels instead of backlash — and forcing Euroscaptics and workers to choose between their packages and chaos.
Mr. Bonn said that leaving means leaving the rally in Solihull, in which he wants to 'fake the checkers'.
She suggested that Mr. Faraz should be made a partner and he should be given the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now," she said.
Wellingborough MP or MP said: 'I will stand for Brexit but we need to get the checkers out.'
Setting its opposition in the European Union, he said: 'We don't need to be subject to anyone to fight a world war.'
We want to make our own laws in our country.
Mr. Bonn rejected all suggestions that changed public opinion after the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed their minds and that they want to stay is a complete lie.'
Tory Brexiter Andrea Jenkins was also in March stating: "I'm just saying this: Prime Minister, listen to the people."
"Checker is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it because it is not so prevalent among our party and our workers who actually gherao the streets and elect us in the first place.
Please leave the checkers and start listening.”
In a focused message for Smt., he said: Prime Minister retains his jobs when he does not break his promise.
Mr. Faraz said the rally leaders should be made 'realising the month' if they cheat with the decision taken in the 2016 Referendum.
"This is now a matter between us - people and our political classes," he said.
"They're trying to cheat Brexit and today we're here to tell them that 'We're not going to let you run away by doing this.'"
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he said: "I want you to create our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit by understanding the atmosphere.
We are organizing the army of the people of this country that has led us to victory in Brexit and which does not rest until we become a free, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, the Reamers march from Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the middle of the city.
A group of activists pointed to Tories against the Brexit banner after the launch of the group this weekend.
Labour peer Lord Adonis pretends to have a conversation about security issues from the party app when the conference opens.
"It's those people who tell us they can have a fair IT system for Canada, a borderless border and a borderless free trade in Ireland and have all the technology."
"It's a full swing.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he said.
Warren plans to adopt a 'strict perspective' on the president's operations
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she will "keep a close watch on the president's operations" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that during a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday, Massachusetts democrats or Democrats spoke about their future.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is in the race for re-election to the GOP state's prestigious Geoff Dhillon November, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
They were speculating that they could replace Trump in 2020.
It was his 36th meeting with voters using the Town Hall format since Trump took office in Hollyok on Saturday afternoon.
One of the attendees asked if she was going to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for “women to go and fix our broken-footed government and include women first.”
He was killed in the death of Simmons.
Police in Beton Disease, LA, on Saturday announced that a suspect was arrested in the murder of LSU basketball player Wade Sim on Friday.
The Betan Disease Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson at 11 a.m. ET news conference or conference.
He released a video of the shooting on Friday, seeking help identifying a man seen in the footage.
Sim, 20, was shot dead near the campus of South University on Friday morning.
"Police chief Murphy G. Paul told 247 Sport per Saturday that he died due to a bullet hit the head of Wade Sim."
Wade went on to defend his friend and was killed by Simpson.
On being asked by Simpson, he admitted to killing Wed Sim with a weapon there.
Simpson was arrested without incident and detained by the Police Department of the East Betan Disease Parish.
A 6-by 6-foot junior who grew up in Beton Disease, played 32 games with 10 starters in the previous season in Sim and rebounded an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton finishes world title after team's win over Sebastian Vettel
From that moment it became clear that Valtteri Bottas deserved to play a major role in the Louis Hamilton Mercedes team order race on Saturday.
From the polls, Bottas made a good start and dropped Hamilton as he made his place in the first two turns and invited Vatel to create hurdles in the drivers of his team.
Vettel first went into the pits and left Hamilton in the traffic behind the pack, something that must be decisive.
The Mercedes was behind a lap and came out of the back of the Vettel but Hamilton went ahead after a few wheel-to-wheel action that saw Ferrari's driver reluctantly leave without risk after a double-move while defending on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and finished seventh when he reached the end of the first lap by his 21st birthday.
He then moved on to a large part of the race when he focused on changing his tires and quickly surpassed Kimi Raikonen in fourth place.
He finally came into the pits on the 44th lap but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps, when Rekonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day when Valtteri did a great job all weekend and is a really nice gentleman.
The team did a fantastic job by getting one or two, Hamilton said.
It was really a very bad feeling.
President Donald Trump on Saturday lied to Senator Dean Feinstein at his request, not leaking a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, in which he accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
While speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the statement made by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting on the current situation in the Senate, saying that people are "meaningful and bad and dishonest."
"A very good thing or thing that could have happened in the Senate in the last few days, when you see anger, when you see angry, mean and bad and dishonest people," he said.
"When you see the release and the leak and then they say, 'Hey, I didn't do it.'
I didn't do that."
Remember?
Dean Feinstein, have you leaked?
His answer is... Did you leaked the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Hey, no.
I didn't leak."
Well, wait a minute.
"No, we didn't, we didn't," he said, pointing to the Senator.
Feinstein was sent back in July a letter detailing the charges against Kwangua by Ford and was leaked in early September - but Feinstein denied that it had been leaked from the office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak his story," Feinstein told the committee, Hill reported.
“She told me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she said.”
But the president did not find his rejection appropriate, who commented at a Saturday night rally: "Let me tell you it was really a very bad gesture.
He may not have done it, but I have hardly ever seen such a bad gesture before.”
Continuing the defence of the Supreme Court candidate, the three women accused of sexual misconduct, the President said the Democrats were using the allegations on their behalf.
"They are determined to take back power by any necessary means.
You see their meanness, dirt, and at the same time that they don't care who they hurt or who they're running behind to gain power or power or control," the intermediary reported to the president's words.
Elite League: Dundee Star 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dever scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars on Saturday won a 5-3 return match in Dundee to compensate for Friday's Elite League loss against Belfast Giants.
The Giants initially got a two-goal lead through the attacks from Patrick Dore and Francis Beauvilleer.
Before Giant's lead, Mike Sullivan and Jordan Crowne Dyer brought home the level before reinstating.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Boschard equalised it for Dundee before securing a victory with two goals by Lucas Lundwalt Nielsen.
It was Adam Keyfe's third Elite defeat of the season for the men, who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
With Giants winning the last three matches, it was the fourth meeting of the session on the sides.
Dwyer's opener Candle came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with McFall's help, with David Rutherford helping Beauvilleer double the lead in the subsequent four minutes.
In the hectic opening period, Sullivan performed his home game back at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt's equalled Counie at 15:16.
Dore makes sure that the Giants take the lead in the first break until he scores his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home side is regrouped and Boschard once again brings them to the level period with a power play goal at 27:37.
Couny and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the second period of the match and ensured a victory in their team's fifth halfway in the final period.
The Giants, who have lost their last five games so far, are now set to play in their home ground Milton Caine on Friday.
The air traffic controller was killed in order to ensure that hundreds of people could escape the earthquake.
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is greeted as a hero or hero since he was killed in ensuring that an aircraft carrying hundreds of people could safely land.
More than 800 people were killed and many more are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi, activating the tsunami on Friday.
The subsequent shocks in the area continued to wreak havoc and many people were trapped under the rubble in the city of Palu.
But while her aides were fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonios Gunwan Aung San Suu Kyi refused to leave her post at Mutiara Sis Al Jufari Airport Palu Airport.
He was stationed there to make sure that the Betik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could land safely.
Then he jumped off the traffic control tower when he thought it was about to fall.
He later died in the hospital.
The decision could have saved hundreds of lives, an Air Navigation Indonesia spokesperson said, reports Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikappan in Kalimantan to take them to a bigger hospital from another city.
Unfortunately, we lost them before the helicopter reached Palu.
"He broke our hearts," she said.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands with the destruction of the country, the undermining agency says, adding that access to Nagla, Sigi and Bottosh is limited.
"The death rate may still rise as many bodies may still be buried or buried, or in many places where they cannot be reached," said the agency's spokesman Sutopo Nugharho.
The waves, up to six meters high, devastated Palu, which led to the mass burial on Sunday.
The military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance came with the bodies.
It is rare to get clean water.
Small markets were looted everywhere.”
Jane Galfand, head of the International Red Cross, told CNN: "Indonesia is running a race to help Red Cross creatures, but we don't know what they'll get there."
It’s already a tragedy, but it can be even worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I am asking all of you to work day and night to complete every task related to evacuation or evacuation."
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake earlier this year, in which about 550 people were killed.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niyogini now reveals that a man is missing since the Lagoon plane crash
The airline, which operates the plane that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Macedonia, now says a man is missing, when it was last reported that 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane while sinking.
Air Niyugni said in a release on Saturday afternoon that it could not trace a male passenger.
The airline said it was working closely with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to trace the man.
The airline does not immediately respond to requests for additional information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
When the plane went down in the water while attempting to land at Duck Island Airport, local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and all of them are now in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the manner in which the incident took place is unclear.
Both the airline and the US Navy said the two planes did not land properly on the runway.
Some witnesses or eyewitnesses thought the plane did not land on the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jenn said the plane had come down a lot.
"It's a very good thing," Jane said.
Jane said she and others were pulled out of the deep water from the emergency exit on board the sinking plane.
He said the aircraft's staff were panicking and shouting and he received a minor injury on the head.
The US Navy said the sailors working nearby to improve the ferries also helped rescue using a winding boat to bring people to shore in about 30 metres (100 ft) of water before the plane sank.
Data from the aviation security network indicates that 111 people were killed in the crash of the PNG-registered airline in the past two decades but no one was involved in the Air Niyugnii.
Analysts said the time of the night when the woman was burnt alive
The prosecution on Saturday reinstated its case to re- prosecuting a man for allegedly burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett presented evidence for hours as an expert witness in the field of investigation analysis.
She told the jury how she had used cell phone records to bring together the activities of 29-year-old Mulzim Quinton Teles and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber on the night of her death.
Rowlett said she received location data from several cellphones, which show that the death was on the evening with the Tallis Chambers, refuting her previous claims, The Clareen-Lager reported.
When the data shows that he was with his friend Michelle Sanford, his cell phone was near the chambers at the time, police told Sanford.
Sanford came forward on Saturday and presented evidence that he was not in the city that day.
When asked if Tallis was telling the truth, when he said he was in a Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he was lying "because his truck was in Nashville."
The second inconsistencies were that Talis said he knew the chambers about two weeks before her death.
Cell phone records show that they had known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chamber's death, Tales had removed all text or messages, calls or contact information from his phone.
"He cut her off from her life," Hale said.
The defense is set to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury for hearing on that day.
High Breed: What is conscious or conscious hip hop?
Hip Hop's trio wants to change the negative view of the genre by filling positive messages in their music.
High Breed from Bristol claimed that hip-hop has been roped from its origins to deal with political messages and social issues.
They wanted to get away from their roots and re-awaken the popular hip-hop.
Artists like Fuges and Common saw a latest resurgence in the UK through artists such as Alaka and Loki.
The other black man?!
NY Naini sues couple after firing after "ethnic" text
A New York nanny sues a couple for biased targeting after a mother complains that she is "the other black person" after making a misleading text.
The couple denies that they are resistors, prosecuting for "abuse."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, after learning that Gisele Maurice, the caretaker of the new baby, was black on her first working day in 2016.
"No other black person," Mrs. Plasco Flaxman told her husband in a text.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, it sent it to Ms. Morris twice.
According to a New York Post, after realizing his mistake, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms Morris, stating that her outgoing nanny, who was an African-American, has done poorly and that she is instead expecting a Filipino.
Ms. Morris was sent home in Uber by paying for her one-day work.
Now, Morris demands a job at the couple and a compensation of $350 per day for six months, at the live-in gig he was hired to start work though without a contract.
"Look, I want to show them that you don't do any such work," he said, adding that "I know it's discrimination," she said in a post on Friday.
The couple said on the claims that they were racists, stating that they could not trust him after insulting him, was justified in ending Morris' employment.
"My wife sent something that she didn't mean.
He is not a racist.
We're not racist people," husband Joe Plasco told the post.
But can you give your children in the hands of someone you’ve ever insulted, even if it’s by mistake?
"Your new baby?
Leave it too."
Like the lawsuit for "abstraction," Plasco said his wife had only two months to have children and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you following someone like that?"
It's not right to do that," the investment banker said.
While the legal trial is still going on, silenced them for their behavior and reasoning has given a quick response on social media to implicate the couple.
Paddington publishers fear that the reader will not link it to their own thoughts and opinions, new letter reveals
Bond’s daughter Karen Jenkle, who was born after the book was approved, said in the letter: “It’s hard to think of putting someone in their place when reading it for the first time before it’s published.
It's amazing to know about the success of Pandington."
Talking about his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before writing a children's book inspired by a small bear toy, he was optimistic about the rejection of his work, saying he had both "happiness and gum" in the 60th anniversary of the publication of his book after his death.
About Paddington, about whom she describes as "an important member of her family," she explains that her father was proud of her potential success.
"He was a quiet man and not at all arrogant," she said.
"But because Pandington was so real to them, it was almost like you had a child who got something: you're proud of them, even if you're not actually doing it."
I think they've seen Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his imagination and creation, he always credited it to Paddington.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was taken to Louis Pastor 2 Hospital in Nice, where the work done by the doctors went in vain.
"Naid was regularly saying it was really bad, not expecting it to be like that," said Mrs. Edn<0xC3><0xA9>n-Laparous.
"Then Ned called me and told me he was going to die in the next two minutes and I have to say goodbye to him.
And I did.
I said, "I love you, son.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The medicine that the doctors gave her to beat her heart was slowly ending up leaving her system.
He had died a long time ago and it was all over.
I just had to go and sit there and wait, knowing that it was all going to end.
I couldn’t do anything to scream, scream or cry, because I was surrounded by people from my family.
I had to take care of everyone."
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, who was sad to lose her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers - who were unaware of what situation they were going through.
"Nobody knows," he said.
"I put my head down and tears were flowing all the time.
It was difficult to express, but I found a feeling of utmost sympathy for Nad in the plane.
She needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her."
Postcards of women who committed suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones to suicide want to prevent others from losing their lives.
Sharan Davis and Kelly Humphrey post cards and phone numbers on the bridge in Welsh with inspirational messages on which people can call for help.
Mr Davis' son was 13 when he was suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mr. Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, said his son was a promising chef who used to spread his smile everywhere.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
He always used to say that his smile can light up everywhere.”
However she had left work before she died and she lived in a “very dark room.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who at the time was 11 years old, was searching for his lost brother or sister, after which he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said: “I was constantly worried that there was going to be a cumulative effect.”
Ms. Davis made the cards, “to let people know that there are people out there who you can talk to, even if they’re a friend.”
Don't sit still - you need to talk."
Ms. Humphries, who has been Ms. Davis’s friend for years, lost her friend Mark, aged 15, shortly after her mother’s death.
"He didn't say anything that he was feeling sad or sad or something else," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we will make some changes in her behavior.
He was very sad on Christmas day - when the kids opened their presents, he couldn't get an eye from them."
She said her death was a big shock to her, but they had to get out of it: "It ripped the family from the inside."
It made us sad.
But we all had to fight ahead."

Kavanaugh's future was hanging in the balance when the FBI investigation began.
“I thought, if I could actually find something he’s looking for – a limited time and limited scope investigation – maybe we could bring a little unity,” Mr. Fleck said on Saturday, and at the same time that he fears the committee among the alleged partisan gridlock is “broken.”
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want a FBI investigation?
His unhappiness was due to time.
The midterm elections were only five weeks away, on November 6 - as expected, Republicans perform very poorly, so they would be severely weakened in their efforts in the High Court on the ground they wanted to win.
George W. Bush picks up the phone to call the Senator, promotes him to support Mr. Kuwangua, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and through him meets his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush’s private secretary or secretary.
What happened after the FBI submitted its report?
The Senate will vote, with 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sitting.
It is unclear whether Mr. Kuwangua could receive at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which Mike Pence, vice president, had to confirm by terminating it and in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's 'dead' by Kim Jong-un
The number of fugitives to North Korea who went to South Korea decreased when John-wen came to power seven years ago, a South Korean administrator said.
Citing the unification ministry of the south, Park Beyonc<0xC3><0xA9>-Syog said 1,127 people had fled their duties last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the strong border between North Korea and China and the high rates imposed by smugglers and occultists were the main factors.
Pyongyang made no public comment.
A large number of fugitives from the North are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled to China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easy to cross the reliably protected areas (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers the fugitives as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends them back to their country by force.
Relations between the North and the South - which are still technically at war - have seen improvement in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks, which focuses on blocking nuclear talks.
It became active in June after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they broadly agree on terms to work toward a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for lack of progress since then.
"Without any faith in America, there will be no trust in our national security and in such circumstances, we will have no choice but to harm ourselves unilaterally first," Mr Rai said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "fun", saying he is not qualified for the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "fun" and said he was "unfit" to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I don't think a woman can do that, they call it "fun," Pelosi said on Thursday, responding to Kavanaugh's evidence before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he had ever sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes yelling and holding his breath while talking about his family and his school years.
He penalized Democrats on the committee by falsifying the allegations of "disgusting and coordinated character assassination" by liberals who were angry over Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential election defeat.
Pelosi said she feels that Kavanaugh's witnesses have proved that she cannot work in the Supreme Court because it shows that she is adamant against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with those statements as well as the way he went to the clintum and the Democrat," she said.
Pelosi expressed doubt that if Kavanaugh becomes permanent when asked if the Democrats win a majority in the House of Representatives, would she still be guilty of Kavanaugh?
"I would say that -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not fair to the Supreme Court, but being invited can work right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi said as a Democrat she was concerned about the possible rules of Kavanaugh against the act or Roe v. Wade's cost-effective care, as she is known to do conservative justice.
In the sense of his certification, Kavanaugh deferred questions about whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"In the hearing of his confirmation, Kavanaugh deferred questions on whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
And women need to move it.
It's a religious objection, months and years of anger go out and she can't stop herself from crying.
Ms. Stamina told me 45 years later that “When we cry, we get angry.”
"I don't think it's unusual, do you think?"
She continued, "A woman helped me a lot who worked as an officer somewhere, who said that she also cried when she got angry, but she has developed a new technique, which means when she gets angry and she starts crying, the person she was talking to will say, "Maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying."
I'm angry."
And then she spoke.
And I thought it was great."
Tears are allowed to come out as part of anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
An early job, one of my most harrowing memories of a male head office, when I found myself crying in an indescribable rage, found that an old woman was holding my neck from behind – a sharp manager from whom I had always been a little frightened – that dragged me down the stairs.
"Don't cry in front of anyone," he said.
"They don't know how strong you are.
They think you're sad and you'll be happy to meet them."
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, has worked with Gary Hart on the presidential run.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught making a relationship with someone other than marriage in a boat or name called Monkey Business and his name was withdrawn from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, who was extremely disappointed, decided to run for president himself.
“It wasn’t a thought-provoking decision,” she said, laughing at me after 30 years.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called him Snow White and Seven Dwarfs.
Since the campaign was delayed, she didn’t have time to collect the money and so she swore that unless she collected $2 million, she wouldn’t participate in the race.
It was a losing battle.
He found that some of his supporters who gave $1,000 to men would give him only $250.
"Do they think I've got a discount?" she wondered.
When she made her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was unable to control the emotions - thanks to those who supported her, disappointments from the system that made it difficult for her to raise money and anger at even the target voters and sexism rather than representatives - she suffocated.
"You must have thought I'd have a nervous break down," Ms. Schroeder recalled how the press would have reacted to them.
"You must have thought that Clenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember what they would put on my samadhi.
"He was crying."""
How the U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The initial salvo of the trade war between the U.S. and China was about to slow down and while the war is far from over, the rift between countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts said.
US President Donald Trump said the first warning was issued earlier this year by imposing major Chinese export taxes, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant increase this week, with new tariffs affecting items up to $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), is effectively taxed on more than half of all goods coming from China to the US.
Beijing has resisted in its own way every time, most recently five to 10 percent of the $60 billion slapping tariff of U.S. goods.
China has promised to match the US shot-to-shot and the world's second-largest economy is likely to shake up soon.
Getting back to Washington means hollowing out demands, but bowing head to the U.S. publicly would be too embarrassing for <0x58>i Jinping, the Chinese president.
Still, experts say that Beijing can move, with the U.S. trade war positively supporting China over the long term, reducing the inter-dependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would either trigger economic tailspins in the country, which is actually even more dangerous than what the audience has seen before," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the center for the new U.S. security, a think tank.
Syria is 'ready' to return refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help to rebuild a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mulam said the situation in the country is improving.
"The situation on the ground is more stable and secure due to the progress made against terrorism today," he said.
The government continues to resettle in areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now present for voluntary return of refugees to the country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that target their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
The other six million people living in the country are still in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Maualm said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries sponsoring the uprising.

In the morning we put some pressure on Europe.
We have defeated them.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He is a good captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
