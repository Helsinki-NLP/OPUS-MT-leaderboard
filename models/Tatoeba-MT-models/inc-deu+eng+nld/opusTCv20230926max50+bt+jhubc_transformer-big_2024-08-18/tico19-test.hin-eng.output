Rapidly increasing cumulative prevalence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from January 1 to March 15, 2020
The cumulative prevalence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases is showing a similar trend in countries in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom confirming that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly across all countries, at different stages depending on the country.
Based on experience from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for a rapid increase in COVID-19 patients who will need health care, especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, the group of pneumonia cases with unknown diagnosing-science was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, China, reported the novel coronavirus, now referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as a pathogen.
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence to date is that 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild disease, that is, respiratory tract infections with or without pneumonia and most of these recover.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops as a more serious disease requiring hospitalization, while in the remaining 6% cases there is an observation of severe illness requiring serious care.
The fatality rate of hospitalised patients due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we assess the trend of cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 in each country in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare it with Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK to Italy during 31 January - 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 further expanded geographically and the current COVID-19 pandemic activity in the rest of the world moved beyond this country.
On March 11, 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The 5 March 2020 edition of Eurosurveillance reported the first European confirmed COVID-19 cases in accordance with the WHO case definition in Spiteri et al.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were found in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported between 31 December 2019 and that date.
Acquiring the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases and the cumulative prevalence
At the European Center for Disease Control (ECDC), only official sources such as the Ministry of Health of countries, the National and Regional Health Authority and each country in the world receiving COVID-19 cases are updated every day at 8:00 am.
These data were used to assess the trend of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and compare them to the disease in Italy.
As a representative of the spread of active COVID-19 cases, we thus calculated the 14-day short cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 cases taking into account the natural process of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK during the period January 1 - March 15, 2020.
We also displayed the cumulative number of reported cases in each country up to 8:00 am on 15 March 2020 compared to Italy in the period 31 January - 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 Trends in EU/EEA Countries and the UK
The trend of a 14-day brief cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally follows Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and across the UK, the overall cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 began to increase around February 21 and grew rapidly around February 28, 2020.
This was mainly due to a sharp increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but the cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK saw a similar growing trend (subsidized content).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to Italy in the period January 31 - March 15, 2020.
It specifically shows that by March 15 at 8:00 am, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already reported the total number of cases comparable to Italy's cases only 3 weeks ago or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trend seen in the cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic is growing at a comparative pace across all countries.
This is in spite of variations in national public health responses and possibly different case definitions in countries and different protocols for patients to choose from, including those to be caught and tested for COVID-19 to be confirmed.
In early March 2020, physicians in the affected areas of Italy reported a situation in which 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas have already reached their maximum capacity.
The figures for hospitalizations and/or intensive care unit of COVID-19 cases are currently only available at the EU/EEA level for 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (not shown statistics).
They should, however, be collected in a disciplined manner to supplement the current surveillance data that focuses on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
The 2010-11 study looked at a huge difference in the availability of intensive care and mid-care beds in Europe from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal per 100,000 population.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 population in 2010-11).
The prevalence of hospitalised COVID-19 cases related to 90% risk of intensive care bed capacity is provided in the sixth update of the ECDC's Acute Risk Assessment on COVID-19, with estimates for every EU/EEA country and UK.
Since cases so far remain in flocks in EU/EEA countries and some regions of the UK and hospitals and intensive care units serve the generally defined regional public, information about cases and intensive care beds should be provided primarily at the Nomenclature of Territorial Unit for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2) level.
The experience gained from Italy and the current trend in other countries shows that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should thus prepare themselves for the continued community transmission status of SARS-CoV-2 and the increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring health care, especially intensive care, as is happening in the affected areas of Italy.
As pointed out in the recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, with the change of mitigation approach from limiting, there is a need for a fast, proactive and comprehensive approach to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2, because if not implemented in a timely manner, the anticipated rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide enough time for decision-makers and hospitals to understand, accept and respond accordingly.
Acute risk assessment also lists public health measures in addressing the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have very little opportunity to further enhance their control efforts and reduce pressure on health care to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
If this fails, it is very likely that the health care systems of other EU/EEA countries will face a rapid increase in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in a disaster for humans.
Similar to its homogeneous virus SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also have been transmitted by bats and produce similar symptoms by the baggage mechanism.
Although COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, it is much more transmissible and affects older people and men more than young people.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications on emerging diseases, this article attempts to provide topical and comprehensive reviews on the rapidly evolving research topic.
We will cover the basics on epidemiology, prophylactic, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
While there are still a lot of questions to be answered, we hope this review will help in understanding and eliminating the deadly disease.
Due to the outbreak of Novel Viral Disease, the Vasantotsav on January 25, 2020 has become an unexpected and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people, who were requested to stay at home for the entire holiday and several weeks thereafter.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that led to the outbreak of Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, on February 11, 2020, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the related disease was named COVID-19.
The pandemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and around 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, there have been more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with more than 40,000 patients discharged and more than 3,000 deaths due to the virus.
The WHO has warned that COVID-19 is "the public's enemy number 1" and possibly more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months after the first report on January 7, 2020, more than 200 articles have been published on COVID-19, including virology, epidemiology, psychiatry, diagnosis, and treatment, which isolated the sequence of the virus from many patients.
This review attempts to summarize the progress of research on new and rapidly evolving subject areas.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other diseases caused by CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss the prevention and forecasting of the disease as well as some of the rest of the more important questions we have learned so far.
CoVs have traditionally been considered non-threatening pathogens for humans, with the common cold generating about 15% of the common cold 4.
However, in this century we have twice faced highly pathogenic human CoVs, i.e., SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which led to outbreaks in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012 respectively and soon spread to many other countries with terrible uneasiness and mortality.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV outbreak in recorded history of humans.
As shown in Figure 1,1, swarms of pneumonia, whose origin was unknown, were first reported to the Chinese National Health Commission from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later the sequence of CoV was released.
The first fatal case was reported from Wuhan on January 15, 2020.
During this time, the pandemic rapidly spread to nearby cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, infection was reported in health care providers, which indicated that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was locked down with all its public traffic shut down.
The first clinical study on the disease on January 24 reported that only 21 of the 41 patients with confirmed cases had direct contact with Wuhan's seafood market, which was considered the starting point of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health disaster.
By the time of this report, the disease has already spread to the whole of China and about 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2.2).
As the situation is growing rapidly, the final magnitude and severity of the outbreak are yet to be determined.
A multi-centric study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients on 11 February 2020 presented a more up-to-date depiction of the pandemic in the following manner (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-H<0x58><0x5F>rHP<0x58>a1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mainly in the age group of 30-65 years.
Nearly half (47.7%) of infected individuals were over the age of 50, much less than 20 and only 14 infected individuals were under the age of 10.
Males (0.31/100,000) were more infected than women (0.27/100,000) from SARS-CoV-2.
COVID-19 has spread mainly in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from start to diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from start to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The original reproduction number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI:3.51-4.05), and adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased rapidly before 23 January 2020, which corresponds to widespread traffic before the spring festival in China.
The mortality rate of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three major risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of single-stranded large and transmissible viruses of RNA.
They can be divided into four generations, that is, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alpha and beta-CoVs are known to infect humans.
The casing nozzle (S) binds to glycoproteins, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, to its cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzymes 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptides 4 (DPP4) and then merges into the membrane.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cellular fluid; after the replication of the viral genome, the casing forms a genome with glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, which are then merged into the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of beta-CoV with more than 99.98% genetic similarity in the 10 indexed samples collected from Wuhan's Hunan seafood market, the epicentre of the outbreak.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in over-extensive segments of the human airway epithelial.
Human ACE2, along with SARS-CoV-2, was found to be available for SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 connects to human ACE2 with more weakness than SARS-CoV which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2, produces less severe infections in patients than SARS-CoV.
Novel small proteins coded by SARS-CoV-2, orf3b and secreted proteins coded by orf8 can also be made.
Orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogens and block the expression of IFN<0xCE><0xB2>; however, orf8 does not have a known functional domain or motif.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al. reported the cryo-EM structure of human ACE2 with full-length at 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> resolution in the mix with amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They found that the mixture, which contained free and closed compositions, was compiled as a dimer and the ACE2-B0AT1 mixture could combine two S proteins that provide evidence for the identification and infection of CoV.
B0AT1 can be a medical target for drug testing to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Basic and intermediate nutrients
It is known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV both originated from bats and transmitted to humans by civet cat and camel respectively.
By ethnic comparisons with other CoVs of SARS-CoV-2, bats were considered the basic nutrient of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% similar to two SARS-like CoVs called bat-SL-CoVZ<0x58>45 and bat-SL-CoVZ<0x58>21.
However, which intermediate nutrient helped the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans is unknown and the transmission path is still to be clarified.
Ji, et al., proposed the snake as a carrier of the virus from bats to humans that included the same recombination with S proteins.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, indicated that pangolins - often long muzzled, ant-eaten mammals that are used in traditional Chinese medicine - are likely intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic similarity in SARS-CoV-2 and CoV found in pangolins.
However, the prevalence of the difference of 1% across the entire two genomes is still a big difference; therefore, conclusive results are awaited for concrete evidence (Figure 33).
The physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours and less than 20<0xC2><0xB0>C in artificial ambient dry environment and up to 5 days at 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays for 30 minutes at 56<0xC2><0xB0>C; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine disinfectants, parastic acid, chloroform and other fat solvents can effectively neutralize the virus, but not chlorhexidine.
The entire human population generally lacks resistance to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the novel virus.
At present, no detailed study has been reported regarding the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
In general, after the virus enters the host, it is for the first time C-type lactin-equivalent receptors, including toll-equivalent receptors (TLR), NOD-equivalent receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-equivalent receptors (RRs) from the intracellular receptors (PRs).
Through various pathways, the expression of virus delivery factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferon (IFNs) stimulates the spread of the virus and accelerates the macrophages phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus avoid immune responses.
Soon, the optimized immune response becomes involved in fighting the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B> T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies and CD8<0x2B> T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
T assistive cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help protect cells.
However, CoV can block T cell functions by killing T cells.
Triangulation resistance, including supplements and immunosuppressants such as C3a and C5a, is also essential for fighting viral infections.
For example, antibodies isolated from the recovered patient deactivated MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the excessive response of the immune system produces a very large number of locally free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and even multiplicity failure and death in the worst-case scenarios.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by the onset in the herd, is more likely to affect older people and pregnant women.
It is common that people who are exposed to a higher number of viruses or whose immune functions are mixed are more likely to become infected than others.
Based on the first 425 cases study in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases found that the incubation period was on average 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned above, based on the demographics of 8,866 cases, the recent study found that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
Adjusting effective quarantine times based on the most accurate incubation period and thus preventing infected but symptomatic people from transmitting the virus to other people is very important for health authorities.
As a general practice, people exposed to or infected with the virus usually need a 14-day quarantine.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often a major and early symptom of COVID-19 with no symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, nasal discharge, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced shortness of breath and/or hypoxemia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients rapidly increased the development of acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidity, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and pulmonary artery abnormalities should also be screened for early diagnosis of the virus.
The Demographics study at the end of December 2019 found that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for shortness of breath and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed the aid of ventilation.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of herds generated by transmission from family herds and symptomatic person.
Comparatively, a 2012 demographic study found that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%) as the main symptoms.
However, far more than COVID-19 patients, 80% of them require the help of ventilation and this is in line with the more lethality of MERS than COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
SARS patients observed that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), shortness of breath (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%) were the major symptoms and about 14%-20% of patients needed ventilation support.
The COVID-19 death rate was 2% as of February 14, when confirmed cases across the world reached 66,576.
Comparatively, as of November 2002, the mortality rate of SARS was 10% of 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, the fatality rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases based on a June 2012 demographic study.
The earlier study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 6.47 higher with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23 while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only between 2 and 4.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV with respect to symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above figures indicate that SARS-CoV-2's ability to spread is higher than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less lethal than both of the latter.
Therefore, controlling the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The herd usually begins with a single family or a single group of people or vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or residence or contact with infected individuals or patients in Wuhan or other affected areas within the last two weeks from the onset.
However, it has been reported that people can transmit the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and the recovered patients who have been discharged from the hospital can again transmit the virus, which warns of extending the quarantine period.
The number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymph cells) in patients in the early stage is normal or low.
For example, lymphatic cell count 1<0xC3><0x97>109/L including white blood cell count 4<0xC3><0x97>109/L with lymphopenia and enlarged aspartate aminotransferase levels and toxicity were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The blood of some patients increased levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin, and the blood of most patients increased C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation.
In patients with severe cases, a product of fibrin collapse present in the blood, the level of D-dimer, was increased and lymph cell count continued to decline.
Most COVID-19 patients have abnormalities in chest radiography and are characterized by bipolar images or ground glass obscurity in the lungs.
Patients often develop abnormal pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, gas exchange is seriously compromised due to uncontrolled supply, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis.
The duplication of type-I and type-II pneumocytes reduces the hyperactive level and increases surface stress and thus reduces the ability of the lungs to flower and increases the risk of stopping lung work.
Therefore, the worst findings of chest radiography often coincide with the most severe condition of the disease.
The first pathological analysis on COVID-19 on 18th February, 2020 looked at the pulmonary virulence of pneumocytes in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, the formation of haline membranes and porous leakage of lymph cells, and multicellular multi-centre cells that were in line with the pathology and ARDS of viral infections and similar SARS and patients.
Detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcribes polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as a key criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false-negative rate that could accelerate the pandemic, clinical manifestations began to be used to diagnose in China on February 13, 2020 (which was no longer solely dependent on RT-PCR).
The same situation occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of the history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is necessary and imperative for effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, Feng Zheng Group reported a protocol using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technology to detect SARS-CoV-2, which is 20<0xC3><0x97>10-18 mol/L to 200<0xC3><0x97>10-18 mol/L without the need for any detailed equipment, using dipsticks.
If verified in clinical samples, there is hope that the new technology can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience.
Due to the lack of experience with Novel CoV, physicians can provide supportive care primarily to COVID-19 patients with other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases previously used for the treatment of or proposed various therapies (Table 2.2).
These therapies include antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, current and potential treatments with Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Plasma from recovered patients was also proposed for use in treatment.
The drug companies are engaged in a fight to develop vaccines and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 attacks primarily on the lungs at the beginning and possibly even on other organs in the lower range, which express ACE2 such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
Still, respiratory dysfunction and failure remain a major threat to patients and are the leading causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is important to relieve symptoms and save lives and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-intrusive ventilation and intrusive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms have to be assisted by the modified heart-pulmonary subcutaneous technique used in the treatment of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
At the same time, maintaining electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting the function of vital organs is also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is known that cytokine storms occur as a result of excessive response of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
The cytokine storm is a type of systemic progressive response characterized by the release of the series of cytokines, including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These incite immune cells to release a large number of cytokine-free particles that are the leading causes of ARDS and multi-organ failure.
Immunity is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, IL6-resistant monoclonal antibodies, have been used for the treatment of cytokine storms.
Other immune treatments for cytokine storms include changes in the T cell-directed immune response; blockades of IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibitors; blinatumob; suppressive of cytokine signaling 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids as an immune suppressant, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high doses of steroids were not useful in severe lung damage in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects affecting the disease-diagnosis dramatically, especially non-vascular osteoarthritis.
Nevertheless, short-term procedures of corticosteroids at low to medium doses are recommended to be used carefully in critically ill COVID-19 patients.
As of the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, Remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue given to the vein, has been found to be effective in a US patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug initially developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Malburg viruses.
Later, Remdesivir also showed a potential blockage of other unicorn RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these, Gilead has made the compound available to China for conducting two tests on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the results are highly awaited.
Also, baricitinib, interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, ipinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as possible therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combined therapy with iipinavir/ritonavir.
Interactions with other drugs used in these treatments should be carefully monitored.
Plasma and immune production from recovered patients
There has been a long history of aggregation of blood from patients cured from an infectious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from suffering from the disease.
In fact, the blood of recovered patients has a relatively high level of immunity towards the pathogen.
The antibodies produced by B lymph cells to fight pathogens and other external substances are immunoglobulins (Ig) and they identify unique molecules in the pathogen and inactivate them directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours with less inflammatory and viral loads and better oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, until specific therapies are developed, verification and clarification are required to propose the method to be used on a larger scale.
At the same time, despite the therapeutic effects, some of the disadvantages related to plasma should be considered carefully.
For example, antibiotics can over-stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially life-threatening poisoning.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and the demand for plasma is high to treat critically ill patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific immunities so fast as to fight the global pandemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify the genetic code that codes the effective antibodies or examine the effective antibodies to the essential proteins of the virus.
Thus, we can rapidly increase the production of immunodeficiency.
TCM has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend mainly on the combination of different components in a different formula based on the TCM principles of diagnosis of a disease.
Most of the effective components are yet unknown or redundant because it is difficult to remove and verify such components or their optimal combination.
Currently, TCM has become one of the major alternative treatments for mild to moderate symptoms or patients who have recovered from severe stages due to a lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19.
For example, Shu Feng Ji Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
87% of patients using TCM, including Gansu (63.7%), Ninxia (50%), and Hunan (50%) saw the highest recovery rates in the treatment of COVID-19 in many provinces of China, while Hubei province where only about 30% of COVID-19 patients used TCM, the recovery rate was minimal (13%).
However, this is a fairly thick comparison as many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should be included in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Bid Zheng and colleagues published a study to compare only Western Medicine (WM) treatments and the combined treatment of WM and TCM.
They found that the timing of body temperature in the WM<0x2B>TCM group being normal, the need for symptoms to go and hospitalization was significantly lower than that of the WM group alone.
Most impressively, the symptomatic worsening rate of the WM<0x2B>TCM group was significantly lower (lightly severe) than that of the WM group (7.4% versus 46.2%) and the mortality rate was lower in the WM<0x2B>TCM group than only the WM group (8.8% versus 39%).
Still, the effectiveness and safety of TCM are still awaited in large-scale and more centres.
It will also be interesting to identify the system of actions and, if possible, clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations.
Suspected or confirmed patients with COVID-19 experience a lot of fear from the highly contagious and deadly disease and people who are quarantined also experience dullness, loneliness, and anger.
In addition, infection symptoms such as fever, low-oxidity and cough, as well as adverse treatment effects such as insomnia, more restlessness and mental agony caused by corticosteroids can cause.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, several psychological diseases were reported, including constant stress, restlessness, panic attacks, psychosis excitement, mental symptoms, delirium, even suicide.
Finding essential contacts and quarantines as part of the public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak can make people more restless and glamorous about the effects of touch, quarantine and stigma on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected persons and persons who come in contact with them as well as to the general public.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with continuous and accurate updates about SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are essential for disrupting the chain of transmission from animal funds and infected humans to sensitive nutrients and are often complementary to antiviral treatments under the control of the pandemic due to the growing viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines to generate long-term and powerful inactivation of SARS-CoV and/or defensive immunity.
The live-animated vaccines have been evaluated in the animal models of SARS.
However, the vivo efficacy of these vaccines in older people and in deadly challenging variants and their safety against zoonotic virus infection are still to be determined before the start of any clinical study.
This is probably because SARS ended 17 years ago slowly and since then no new cases have been reported.
On the contrary, sporadic cases and swarms of MERS continue to arise in the Middle East and spread to other areas due to the presence of Junotic sources in areas of the pandemic.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed using sub-units of inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant proteins and some have been evaluated in animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for people with non-resistance capability is an essential and critical task for controlling the ongoing pandemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome the difficulty due to the long-term need for vaccine development (on average 18 months) and the dynamic variations of CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has recently begun to reveal its entire clinical process in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover slowly without the symptoms of other diseases.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also related to high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, it is necessary for health-care agencies to make a disease-reporting paradigm to determine the priority of their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on yet-informed clinical studies, the following factors may affect or be related to the disease-diagnosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the disease-diagnosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
In the study of 8,866 cases, COVID-19 occurred mainly in the age group of 30-65 years, of which 47.7% were patients over the age of 50 years, as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have underlying sedatives and complications and who did not have such a requirement were significantly older (at the median age of 51 versus 66), which indicates age as a predictive factor of the outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: More men have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as mentioned above.
Complications and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart damage and arrhythmias.
Heart events were also the main cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also be associated with ACE2-positive cholengiocytes that can cause liver disease in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age and underlying disease have deep correlations and can interfere with each other.
Unusual laboratory findings: C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the blood reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue damage and have been proposed as a possible predictive factor of disease, response to therapy and finally recovery.
The severity of COVID-19 and the correlation of the CRP level with disease diagnosis have also been proposed.
Also, increased lactate hydrogens (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine kinase (CK) can also help in predicting the result.
These enzymes are widely manifested in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Thus, they are traditional indicators of heart or liver diseases.
Major clinical symptoms: The topical progression of chest radiography and clinical symptoms along with other problems should be considered for predicting the consequences and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As mentioned above, steroids are generally immunogenic to use as a concomitant therapy in infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since high doses of corticosteroids were widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors suffered from non-vascular osteoarthritis with a lifetime of disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, the steroid should be used in low doses and in COVID-19 patients for short-term.
Mental stress: As mentioned above, many patients have suffered from extraordinary stress during the outbreak of COVID-19, as they often witnessed the long duration and extreme uncertainty of the quarantine and the death of close family members and fellow patients.
Providing psychological advice and long-term support is essential to help these people get out of stress and get back to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, epidemiological characteristics differ from SARS to COVID-19.
Along with replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory tract and does not cause mild or any symptoms in the early stages of infection, like other CoVs that cause colds.
Therefore, infected patients can generate large amounts of the virus during daily activities in the initial stage or incubation period with very high difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV was thought to have occurred when patients were very ill, while most transmissions did not occur during the early stages.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the outbreak of SARS.
With the hope of disrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, huge efforts are currently underway in China, including lockdowns in Wuhan and nearby cities and the continued quarantine of almost the entire population.
While these steps are dramatically destroying the economy and other areas of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, pointing to the downfall of the pandemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by the end of March and the upswing phase will last 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be far more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., set the pattern to predict the outcome of the pandemic and indicated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
The Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 has been identified in both mid-turbinate and throat swabs of patients who recovered and went to the hospital 2 weeks ago, indicating that the newly identified virus, like influenza, could become a recurring case.
However, there have been promising signs from China based on the decreasing number of new cases, which indicate that current strategies may be working.
It was initially predicted to be one million cases with half a million deaths from Ebola.
However, by strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has finally been brought under control.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakens in infectiousness and eventually ends up becoming a less pathogenic virus that co-exists with humans.
The comparison of the COVID-19 pandemic with SARS and MERS is given below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is also highly transmissible by coughing or sneezing and possibly direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also found in feces, which also generates a new possibility of oral transmission from feces.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases, including 17 patients with pre-existing diseases and 40 health care providers, were likely due to medical infections.
Therefore, great caution must also be taken to protect people or infected people standing next to humans, especially in contact with health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and patients.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is wearing a mask; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series <0x23>1860s) helps to control the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent fluid droplets from potentially infected person from going into the air or sticking to the surface of things from where they can go in others.
However, only N95 (series <0x23>1860s) masks with only 5% of the virus can prevent as little as 10 to 80 nm from inhaling; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and both are about 85 nm.
Since particles can also cross five surgical masks placed on top of one, health care providers with direct contact with patients must wear N95 (series <0x23>1860s) masks, but not surgical masks.
Along with masks, health care providers should wear isolation gowns that fit to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person with eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2, although he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered the body with his inflammatory eyes.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear transparent facial armor or glasses while working with patients.
The general public in affected or potentially affected areas is strongly suggested that everyone wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, try to stay indoors for self-quarantine and possibly limit contact with infected persons.
Three feet is considered a reasonable distance for people to stay away from the patient.
These activities are effective measures to reduce the risk of infection as well as to prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came as a new virus to the human world, as reported on January 7, 2020, due to the excessive resemblance to SARS-CoV, it may have made China highly wary based on the deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, as of 19 January 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control consoled citizens by saying that the novel virus has low human-to-human transmission and limited fertility and has no problems in preventing and limiting the disease.
This message freed the public from a lot of fear, especially when the entire country was preparing for the spring festival and the delicate time to limit the disease to a minimum in Wuhan was gone.
Disease control agencies in China can learn a lot from this and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies must (1) be quite careful when making public announcements because every word matters to citizens and can change their attitude and decision; (2) to be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for formal information from physicians or authorities; (3) to be more restrictive to the early stage of the possible pandemic, rather than to the continuing practice of raising awareness of the public; and (4) to the public about the pandemic.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and around 50 other countries around the world by the time of this writing.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has led to repeated occurrence of SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are necessary to limit the pandemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects men more than older people and women, and the severity and mortality in the elderly are also higher than the young.
The death rate of SARS is higher than COVID-19 (10.91% vs. 1.44%).
While COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when symptomatic, SARS patients often do so when they are critically ill, which causes much more difficulty in limiting the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and with greater prevalence than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, the recovered patients can again be positive for the virus.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Despite such rapid progress in research on COVID-19, many serious cases remain to be resolved, which are as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic similarity was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat SARS-like CoVs, we still cannot come to the conclusion that SARS-CoV-2 came from bats.
The original nutrient, suppose that which was the intermediate species in the transmission of the virus from bat to human?
Without finding the answer to <0x23>1 and <0x23>2, we can’t effectively stop broadcasting and there can be a repeat of the outbreak.
Although molecular simulations and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 connects to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the airway cells and then make pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind ACE2-person cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot get a fast and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the pandemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during transmission to humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, will it end slowly like SARS or will it continue to happen periodically like the flu?
This is necessary, but it may take some time to find answers to the above and many other questions.
However, whatever the price has to be paid, we have no other option but to stop the pandemic as soon as possible and bring our lives back to normalcy.
Animal origin of human coronaviruses
The mutations and adaptations have led to the simultaneous development of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their nutrients (including humans) over a period of thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, there were two human CoVs (HCoVs) that caused mild illnesses such as colds.
The outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) completely reversed the situation, demonstrating the devastating and deadly nature of HCoV infection.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has brought CoVs back to light and shocked us with more infectious capacity but reduced pathogenicity than its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a zoonotic disease and understanding the zoonotic origin of HCoVs will be of our help.
Most HCoVs originate from bats, in which they are non-infectious.
There is also information about some HCoVs’ intermediate coat nutrients.
In the prevention of human diseases, the identification of animal nutrients has direct implications.
Checking the interactions of CoV-nutrients in animals can also provide significant insight into the pathogenicity of CoV in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of the current information about the seven HCoVs with a focus on the history of discovery, as well as on the zoonotic origin and interspecies transmission.
Importantly, we compare and see variations of different HCoVs from the point of view of the gradual development of viruses and gene recombination.
The current COVID-19 pandemic is discussed in this perspective.
At the same time, the implications of the gradual development of the virus on the need to successfully change nutrients and the severity of the disease have also been highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the coronavirus family, which includes groups of inveloped, positive-sensed, single-stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses that sheltered the largest genomes of 26 to 32 kilobases in RNA viruses were named "CoVs" because of crown-like morphology under the electron microscope.
Structurally, CoVs contain non-volume genomes that have the same structure.
About two-thirds of the genome consists of two large overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted into pp1a and pp1b replication polyproteins.
Polyprotein is further processed to produce 16 non-structural proteins called nsp1<0x7E>16.
The rest of the genome contains ORF for structural proteins, including spikes (S), invelopes (E), membranes (M) and nucleoproteins (N).
Many hereditary-specific auxiliary proteins are also coded by different genealogy of CoVs.
Based on variations in protein sequences, CoV is divided into four generations (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV), most of which are HCoVs in the beta-CoV generation and are subdivided into four genera (A, B, C, and D).
Racial evidence has shown that bats and mutes are mostly the gene sources of alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the major cells of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have consistently surpassed species barriers and have emerged as some of the most important human pathogens.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually produce mild symptoms like colds and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, generating severe lower respiratory tract infections in relatively more patients with a greater likelihood of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and hyperphagic manifestations.
The first HCoV-229E breed, B814, was isolated from the nasal flow of cold patients in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more information about HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 has been collected, both of which produce self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, until the outbreak of SARS, the concept was widely accepted that the infection of HCoVs is generally harmless.
The SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003 infecting more than 8,000 people with an untreated case fatality rate of about 10% is one of the most devastating outbreaks in current history.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak caused a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread elsewhere in the world.
2019 Novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), later named SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has led to the death of 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm bell is ringing and the world has to prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The bat of all seven HCoVs is an animal origin derived from rats or domestic animals.
Many evidence supports the gradual development of all HCoVs from bats, including viruses that are well adapted and non-infectious, but show extreme genetic variations.
The COVID-19 pandemic has posed huge medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges for China and the world.
Detecting the zoonotic source of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history, motivational power, and bonding factors of the species.
It can guide or facilitate the discovery of SARS-CoV-2's cosmological, intermediate and amplifying fauna (s) with a significant impact in preventing future spread.
In this review we present an overview of the zoonotic origin, endogenous transmission, and pathogenicity of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss that common topic that the ancestral viruses of HCoVs are non- pathogenic in their natural cell nutrients, but become pathogenic after transgenic transmission into new nutrients.
We will also review the trend of the gradual development of HCoV in which the increase in infectiousness is often accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity.
The outcome of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also discussed in this perspective.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
The first of the HCoV-229E strain, first isolated from the nasal flow of infected common cold patients, was isolated from several infected animals, including turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven HCoVs have been identified in the past decades.
A brief summary of the chronology of the history of the discovery of HCoV (Table 1) will be informative and educational.
The first breed of HCoV-229E was separated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infections in the year 1966, which later adapted to grow in the cellular lines of the WI-38 lung.
In 10<0x7E>20% of cases in patients infected with HCoV-229E, symptoms of fever and cough were observed, including headaches, sneezing, discomfort and sore throat.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was separated from the sequential pathway in the brain of the milk-drinking rat and from organ augmentation.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to the infection caused by HCoV-229E that are symptomatic of infection with other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread around the world and are likely to be transmitted prominently during the winter season with warmer weather.
Usually, the period of gradual development of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by about 2-week illness.
According to a study by human volunteers, mild colds developed in healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E.
Only a few patients with immunocompromised immune function have severe lower respiratory tract infections.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia," was the first well-documented epidemic in human history caused by HCoV and the third factor, discovered, is HCoV, SARS-CoV.
The first case of SARS can be identified in late 2002 in Guangdong province of China.
The SARS epidemic has spread to many countries and continents with 774 deaths, with 8,096 cases reported.
In addition to the most spreaders, it was estimated that with a gradual development period of 4 to 7 days and the maximum viral impact appearing on the 10th day of the disease, nearly two secondary cases could increase due to each case.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially show symptoms such as muscle soreness, headaches, bloating, discomfort and colds, followed by shortness of breath, cough and respiratory distress as later symptoms.
Lymphopenia, eccentric liver function testing and increased creatine kinase are common abnormalities related to the laboratory of SARS.
Transmitted aerodynamic damage, epithelial cell proliferation and increase in macrophages are also seen in patients with SARS.
About 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation later on.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, many organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidneys with cytokine storms, can also become infected in these severe cases, which can be especially deadly for patients with disabilities in the immune system.
The virus was first isolated from the symptomatic patient's relative with an open biopsy of the lungs that traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, a lot of effort has been made in the research of HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was separated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
It was initially found to be spread in young children, the elderly and patients with immunity to respiratory diseases.
It is common to see colds, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
In the second independent study, an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands described separating the same virus from a nasal sample.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it has actually spread all over the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 causes about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases and its peak incidence occurs during early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 belongs to the obstructive larynx, also known as Krupp.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old elderly man who was hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and bronchiolitis from the community, it was also reported to be related to severe asthma outbreaks of HCoV-HKU1.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found all over the world causing mild respiratory diseases.
All four of these community HCoVs have been well adapted in humans and are usually less likely to mutate to produce highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons as in the rare case of a more toxic subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to have caused severe lower respiratory tract infections in China.
Usually, when these HCoVs are able to communicate efficiently and sustain themselves in humans, they also become less toxic or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient in Saudi Arabia in 2012, with acute pneumonia and kidney failure developing.
While most laboratory confirmed cases originate from the Middle East, imported cases with occasional secondary spread in close relatives have been reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
The second secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
Clinical manifestations of MERS, characterized by progressive severe pneumonia, are similar to SARS.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also develop acute renal failure, which has so far been seen only in MERS in diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2500 laboratory confirmed cases were reported with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses known to humans.
From mid-December 2019 to the end, swarms of pneumonia patients related to SARS-CoV-2 infection were found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international concern and also named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide with an unrecovered case fatality rate of 3.4%.
Notably, the case fatality rate in Hubei China is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which appear in the form of cough, cough and respiratory distress.
Diarrhoea is also seen in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can grow as a rapid acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high nucleotide sequence similarity of 82%, they come in different branches of ethnic descent.
SARS-CoV-2 is obviously less pathogenic than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but more transmissible.
The symptomatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and can contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
Very interesting similarities and variations have been observed by comparing SARS-CoV-2 to the other six HCoVs and seeing asymmetry.
First, the morbidity period and the duration of the procedure of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the normal trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 is similar to those of SARS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, the infection of SARS-CoV-2 shows characteristics that are usually observed during the infection of the HCoVs acquired from the community, including non-specific, mild or no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen, as is the case with SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is also characterized by the variants of both community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the prevalence of HCoVs acquired from the community.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether SARS-CoV-2's infectivity decreases after progressing in humans, like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples.
Whether rectal-directed transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role in at least some situations like SARS-CoV remains to be clarified by future studies.
It is also particularly interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 can behave seasonally like cases of HCoVs acquired from the community.
Nevertheless, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including infectiousness, pathogenicity, and persistence after moving into humans, will be effective on the final outcome of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.
The HCoVs acquired from all four communities that produce mild symptoms, have been well adapted in humans.
From another point of view, it may also be correct that humans have become well adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both can survive the ancient HCoV epidemics.
The HCoVs that cause serious illnesses in humans and the humans who develop serious HCoV diseases have been eliminated.
For this to happen, the accumulation of adapted mutations preventing nutrient restriction factors will have to replicate HCoVs in humans in a sufficient range.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people infected, the more likely it is to be fully adapted in humans.
If it is well adapted, its transmission in humans will be difficult to prevent from quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, four community-acquired CoVs have been transmitting to the human population, causing colds in immunocompromised patients.
These viruses do not require animal cells.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been well adapted in humans and their transmission in humans cannot be maintained.
They need to remain and spread in their animalized cells and possibly find a chance to be transmitted to receptive human targets by one or more intermediate and growing nutrients.
The characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are similar to those of both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the HCoVs acquired from the four communities.
At least at the present time it is very contagious like the HCoVs acquired from the community.
However, it is more pathogenic than the community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen if it will be fully adapted in humans and transmitted to humans without any cous or intermediate animal nutrients.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it will be very useful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the gradual development, natural, cell, intermediate and enhancing nutrients of HCoVs.
An animal is a nutrient with a gradual growth of HCoV if it shelters a very close ancestor with a high similarity sharing at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The hereditary virus is usually well-optimized and non-infectious in this nutrient.
In the same way, the hair follicles provide shelter to HCoV continuously and for a long time.
In both situations, the nutrients become naturally infected and are the natural nutrients of HCoV or its parent virus.
On the contrary, if HCoV enters a new intermediate nutrient right before or around entering humans, it is not well adapted to the new nutrient and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate nutrient can act as an animalized source of human infection and can play the role of an enhanced nutrient by temporarily reproducing the virus and then transmitting it to humans to increase the level of infection.
If an HCoV cannot keep its transmission within the intermediate nutrient, it can go into an end-infection.
On the other hand, HCoVs can also adapt to intermediate nutrients and maintain locality for a long time.
In this case, the intermediate nutrient becomes the natural cell nutrient.
Epidemiological data retrospectively showed that the indicator case of SARS had a history of contact with game-playing animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence investigations indicated that animal traders had a greater prevalence of SARS-CoV-resistant IgG than the general public.
Masked palm civets (paguma larvae) and raccoons in living animal markets have been identified as carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses that are largely similar to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no further SARS was reported after all the seaweeds in the markets were killed.
However, it has been reported that most of the masked palm seaweed in the wild or fields, not in contact with the live animal markets, was SARS-CoV negative, which makes it clear that masked sail seaweeds can only be as severe as an enhancer nutrient in the middle and not as a natural coat of SARS-CoV.
Notably, since 80% of the markets in Guangzhou are anti-SARS-CoV-resistant in different animals, there is no denying the possibility that many species of small mammals can also be intermediate-enhancing nutrients of SARS-CoV.
All of these appear to be the final nutrients of SARS-CoV.
The follow-up discovery of the natural animal nutrient of SARS-CoV revealed a very close bat CoV called SARS-related Rhinolophas bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in Chinese horsepower bats.
These bats are positive towards SARS-CoV-resistant antibodies and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other bats share 88-92% nucleotide sequence similarity with CoVs, SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are the nutrients of the emerging human pathogens.
Many SARS such as CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in bats but no one other than WIV1 has been isolated as a living virus.
Human angiotensin converter enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as a receptor of SARS-CoV.
WIV1, extracted from specimens of bat feces, was demonstrated to use bats, seaweed and human ACE2 as receptors for cellular penetration.
Interestingly, the serum of healthy SARS patients was able to inactivate WIV1.
So far, WIV1 is the closest ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats sharing 95% nucleotide sequence similarity.
Despite the greater similarity between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the closest ancestral virus to SARS-CoV and bats are not the closest cosh host to SARS-CoV.
Racial analysis grouped MERS-CoV into a group similar to bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
The bats use the same nutrient receptor, dipeptidyl peptides 4 (DPP4), for the entry of CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV viruses.
MERS-CoV's RNA-based RNA polymerase sequences are racially close to the bat beta-CoV counterparts identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest bat CoV-HKU25 have only 87% nucleotide sequence similarity.
Therefore, bats may not even be the closest shell nutrients to MERS-CoV.
Studies in the Middle East, on the other hand, have found that in many African countries, lumbered camels, like camels of Middle East origin, are seropositive to MERS-CoV-specific inactivation antibodies.
Living MERS-CoV, similar to the virus found in humans, was isolated from the nasal swabs of humming camels, which shows that camels are the authentic corpus of MERS-CoV.
It is also noteworthy that the camels that were experimentally infected with MERS-CoV saw generally mild symptoms but very high virus clearance.
Notably, infected camels extract viruses not only from the respiratory tract but also from the faecal-directed route, which is also the main route for the removal of the virus from bats.
However, questions are still present as there is no history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms of multiple confirmed cases of MERS, possibly due to human-to-human transmission or an unknown transmission pathway that includes species of animals sheltering MERS-CoV.
CoV RaTG13 shares 96.2% nucleotide similarity to SARS-CoV-2 from bats isolated from bats belonging to rhinolophas species.
Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases, the sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is enough to determine the ancestral relationship.
That is, bats cannot be the closest to SARS-CoV-2, unless they get nearly the same bats CoVs in the future.
Possibly, Huanan, the intermediate animal nutritionist of SARS-CoV-2, should be among the wild species sold and killed in the seafood wholesale market with several early cases of COVID-19 being associated with an indicator of human transmission from potential animals.
A number of recent studies based on the metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis Javanica) may also harbour ancestral beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
These new pangolin CoV genomes share 85-92% nucleotide sequence similarity with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13 with a similarity of about 90% at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
They are in two sub-elements of SARS-CoV-2-equivalent viruses in the genitourinary lineage, one of which shares a more similar receptive binding area (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2 with 97.4% amino acid sequence similarity.
In contrast, RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are very diverse despite the genetically more sequence similarities.
An earlier study of ailing pangolins also reported the discovery of a group of viral hypertensive DNA from lung samples, which was similar to SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted several different blended methods and manual curation to generate a partial genome sequence with a full-length viral genome of 86.3%.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal nutrients of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence in support of the direct pangolin origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to sequence diversity between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
Also, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is less than that of SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
The path of gradual development of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals is yet to be established.
While the highest sequence similarity has been found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest genome-wide sequence similarity.
It is a very hypothetical idea that the highly similarity between the pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 is due to selectively intermediary convergence gradual development.
An alternative proposal is in favor of recombination between pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As the driving force of gradual development, recombination is widely present in beta-CoVs.
The closest zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Ethnic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E bats may have originated from CoVs, while ancestral viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in the mute.
It has been reported that the bat CoV called ARCoV.2 (Applachen Ridge CoV) found in North American three-color bats was closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, another bat named HCoV-229E Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008 was genetically related to CoV, which was found in Ghana, although camelids are also its suspected intermediate nutrients.
For clarity, a summary of the current information on the animal origin of known HCoVs is given in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Ethnic analysis has provided evidence of interethnic transmission events of HCoVs in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from domestic animals around 1890, an epidemic of respiratory infections was observed.
The history of interethnic transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Alfa-CoVs have been found very close to HCoV-229E.
There is an alpha-CoV between them.
Many evidence supports transmission from virus bats directly to humans.
Previously, humans, not Alpaca, had contact with bats in shared ecological habitats.
Instead, humans have a close relationship with alpaca.
Second, HCoV-229E-related bats are diverse and non-infectious in alpha-CoV bats, while alpaca alpha-CoV caused respiratory disease outbreaks in infected animals.
Alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that Alpaca HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoVs are derived from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are direct sources of human pathogenic viruses containing rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, where bats are the gene pools of alpha-CoVs HCoV-229E, alpacas and hunched camels can be intermediate nutrients that transmit viruses to humans, just like in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interethnic transmission from bats to hunched camels and hunched camels to humans.
The gradual development of MERS-CoV from bats is known to be its primary identification and further strengthened by subsequent findings.
It is clear that bats provide a rich pool of virus species for interethnic exchange of genetic fractions and interspecies transmission.
Long ages, dense settlements, close social interaction and extreme ability to fly are favorable conditions for all bats to be the ideal "virus broadcasters."
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has entered hunched camels for several decades.
It has been well adapted to these camels that have been transformed from intermediate nutrients to stable and natural coat nutrients.
MERS-CoV produces a very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
It is a sporadic transmission accident in humans and humans remain the last host of MERS-CoV because its transmission cannot be maintained.
Unlike the role of camels in transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins in transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if any, is different.
Specifically, pangolin beta-CoVs are much more pathogenic in pangolin.
They can be the last nutrient of SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs like sewage in the case of SARS-CoV.
Many possibilities of interracial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans are to be accepted or denied in future studies.
First, bats can be almost identical to SARS-CoV-2-related virus's coat of nutrients.
Humans can share ecological habitats with bats by hitting or mining coal.
Second, pangolins may be one of the intermediate-increasing nutrients in which the SARS-CoV-2-related virus was newly entered.
Humans are infected with the virus by killing and consuming game meats.
It is possible that many mammals, including pets, may be receptive to SARS-CoV-2.
Surveys of immunodeficiency in domestic and wild animals are required.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still being investigated.
In addition to the variety of animal nutrients, three key factors in relation to viral are also important in easily overcoming the species barriers of CoV.
First, they have a relatively higher mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-celled RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of CoV with an average replacement rate of <0x7E>10-4 replacement per site per year can be considered "moderate" to "high" depending on the stage of CoV adaptation in the new nutrient.
CoVs contain proof-reading exoribonuclease, the elimination of which can also lead to excessive variability and debility or loss of life capacity.
Interestingly, nucleotide analog remdesivir, is thought to suppress the replication of CoV by this exoribonuclease and RNA-based RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
Nevertheless, the mutation rate of CoVs is one million times higher than that of their nutrients.
At the same time, the mutation rate is often higher when CoVs are not well adapted to the nutrient.
Compared to SARS-CoV with higher mutation rates, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is clearly low, which indicates higher levels of adaptation in humans.
Perhaps, it has already adapted to another nutrient closer to humans.
Along with SARS-CoV-2, it also applies to MERS-CoV which has been well adapted to hump camels.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic flux will rapidly neutralize vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.
Second, the larger RNA genome in CoV puts additional plasticity on the genome change for mutation and recombination, which increases the likelihood of intergenerational co-chronological development, which is beneficial for the emergence of Novel CoVs when conditions are appropriate.
It is supported by the abundant unique open reading frame and the coded protein functions at the 3rd end of the genome.
Third, CoVs randomly change the pattern repeatedly during RNA replication by a unique “copy-choice” procedure.
In a nutrient that acts as a mixture character, the fiber change often occurs during CoV RNA transcription.
Extremely similar full-length and subgenomic RNAs can recombine and produce new CoVs.
Racial evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as animal coVs such as bats SL-CoV and bats CoV-HKU9.
The interaction of the virus-protein with respect to transmission.
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the viral interaction with the nutrient receptor is another important factor affecting inter-caste transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is seen as a common example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interethnic transmission events.
Based on a comparative analysis of the dividers between humans and seaweed SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoV is thought to be rapidly adapting to various nutrients, especially with mutations on the RBD of S proteins.
Usually, RBD in a CoV's S protein interacts with the cellular receptor and is chosen by a nutrient immune response with intensity.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is in the 318th to 510th amino acids on the S1 segment that connects with human ACE2 as well as its co-customers for viral penetration.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is able to recognize ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bats, seaweeds, rats, and raccoons, leading to intracellular transmission of viruses.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed in RBD separately from human and sewage viral separations and 4 of them are located in receptor-binding parentheses for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The RBD of Seaweed SARS-CoV contains K479N and S487T mutations that can increase the attraction of the interaction of spike proteins with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acid replacements can be important in the adaptation of viral in humans.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
The 30% variation between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein indicates that the bond similarity of its S protein with human ACE2 may have changed.
In fact, the cryo-EM study indicates 10 to 20 times more attraction of this pair than the addition between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It will also be interesting to determine if another co-applicant will be required for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also connects to ACE2, but from a different part of S.
Many other HCoV receptors exist, such as aminoeptides N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated silic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of CoVs in humans after interethnic transmission from their animal tissues.
The result of interethnic transmission of HCoVs is controlled by cellular receptors, in addition to other nutrient dependence and restriction factors.
The variation of these nutrient proteins between humans and HCoVs' natural coat nutrients, such as bats, hump-flavored camels, and mosquitoes, can hinder interethnic transmission.
The successful interethnic transmission of HCoVs involves grabbing the nutrient dependence factors and reversing the nutrient restriction factors.
In this regard, molecular determinants are yet to be identified and described in this important area of virus-prone interaction.
A non-partisan genome-wide investigation of the nutrient dependence and restriction factors of SARS-CoV-2 using the latest technology of CRISPR can be fruitful.
The emergence of Novel HCoVs: Return to Basics
The variety of bat CoVs provides ample opportunity for the emergence of Novel HCoVs.
In this sense, bats act as the gene cache of CoVs, HCoVs.
At the same time, rapid mutations and genetic recombination also lead to the development of HCoV and serve two important stages in the process.
For example, the novel protein-coding gene has the potential to change the viral symmetry of acquisition or loss too much.
In SARS-CoV auxiliary proteins, ORF8 has been considered important in adaptation in humans, since SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated, but they were found to code diverse ORF8 proteins.
The feature of the 29-nucleotide deletion of SARS-CoVs has been found in breeds isolated at the beginning of the human pandemic.
This deletion breaks ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered an adaptation mutation that promotes cell replacement.
Additionally, SARS-CoV has a potential recombination history with alpha- and gamma-CoVs genealogy, identifying a very large number of small recombination areas in RNA-based RNA polymerase.
Recombination locations were also identified in parts of nsp9, mostly nsp10, and nsp14.
In the same way, it has been observed that the epidemic MERS-CoV experienced recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in humming camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs, with HCoVs recombining with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial elections can cause unintended changes in the viral genome, possibly due to election-free viruses, such as by the nutrient immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype breed due to two-nucleotide deletion.
While ORF4 can be observed in bats and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, Alpaca alpha-CoV shows a single nucleotide entry, leading to a frameshift.
Finally but not less important, the gradual development of Novel HCoVs also stems from the pressure of choice in their blood vessels.
symptomatic or only mild symptoms were identified when bats were infected with CoVs which indicates mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It seemed that bats were structurally and physically well adapted to CoVs.
For example, defects in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathogenicity generated by CoVs.
In addition, the deterrent of natural malignant cell activity in bats is suppressed due to regulation of natural malignant cell protease NKG2/CD94 and low expression levels of key tissue conformation complex Category I molecules.
In addition, a higher level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by more metabolic activity of bats can suppress the replication of CoV and affect the proof reading by exorbitant molecules, thus providing the selection pressure for the production of highly pathogenic virus breeds upon entering the new nutrient.
More pathogenic CoV breeds may also develop by recombination, which may lead to new protein or protein features for nutrient adaptation.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that three novel HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-infectious or cause mild symptoms in cellulite nutrients such as bats and camels.
Without showing a strong nutrient-resistant reaction, they form a strong replica.
There is a secret to why symptomatic carriers are seen and what are the causes of serious cases in human infections.
Severe symptoms, mainly due to the immune response and hyperactivity of the cytokine storm, in which the higher the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in symptomatic carriers, the immune response is separated from the CoV replica.
The same strategy to isolate the immune response can have beneficial effects in SARS-CoV-2-anti-medicine.
The interferon reaction is particularly sharp in bats.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon in humans should be beneficial at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Also, the NLRP3 inflammation in bats is defective.
With this logic, the blocking of NLRP3 influenzae along with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The spread of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same common theme that led to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While bat beta-CoV has seen 95% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV, bat-CoV also has 96% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV-2.
While the markets have seen seaweed and other animals sheltering viruses similar to SARS-CoV, the closest intermediate nutrients to SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Surprisingly similar pangolin beta-CoVs have been found from SARS-CoV-2, which indicates that pangolin may be one of the intermediate nutrients or that pangolin beta-CoVs may contribute to gene fractions in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although the question persists, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is intentionally made or accidentally man-made.
CoVs have come under the spotlight due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has changed our understanding of the animal corpus of HCoVs in animal origin and standard transmission.
Extensive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are the basic bats and the transmission in humans is through intermediate nutrients.
Given that the SARS-CoV infection is caused by contact between humans and seaweed in markets, closing the wet markets and killing the seaweed there should have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, pangolin should be removed from the wet market to prevent animal transmission due to the discovery of many hereditary strains of pangolin beta-CoVs close to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted by pangolins and other mammals to humans and how it is to be clarified in future tests.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has entered hunched camels for several decades.
These camels are an important means of transport for locals as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool products.
They are widely spread in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to abandon all camels to control MERS as was done in China's wild animal markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
A comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels in combination with other infection control measures to prevent repeated outbreaks of MERS.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new gene forms may emerge to generate outbreaks.
Various animal-derived COVs are circulating in wild animals.
In particular, bats CoVs with zoological potential are very diverse.
It is very likely that there will be functional growth and recombination of these zoonotic CoVs, so that new CoVs emerge which will be more infectious and/or fatal in humans in the future.
To reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, the culture of eating wild animals in some areas of China must be abandoned.
With the tough test of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparation and response planning should be done.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural cells until there is no chance of spreading.
Although bats have many characteristics that help in the spread of viruses, if people are educated about how to stay away from bats, the possibility of humans contacting them and other wild species can be minimized.
For a better understanding of the ecology of CoVs and their natural nutrients, constant monitoring of mammals is essential, which will be useful in preventing human transmission from animals and future outbreaks.
Finally, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonotic disease is to stay away from the ecological habitats of the natural cells of man-animal viruses.
Many parts of the puzzle of the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit the ancestral virus of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it will be interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins can share the same ecological habitat.
Second, if bats play a direct role in human transmission, it should be determined how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal acts as an actual intermediate nutrient, it should be made clear how it interacts with various species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be receptive to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infections should be performed.
Whether it is bats, pangolins or any other mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or their ancestral viruses, which are almost identical, will be identified in their natural hosts in the future.
The ongoing investigation in this area will clarify the gradual development pathways of SARS-CoV-2 in animals with significant effects in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the clinical criteria of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our team published quick consultation guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, and this guideline provides our experience and appropriate context to fight this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the findings of ongoing research and experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also being constantly updated.
In this letter, we answered a comment on our guidelines and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" in accordance with the latest diagnosis and treatment guidelines (seventh edition) of COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, there has been a outbreak of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which has now been officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus has been named the Extreme Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO has identified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed quick consultation guidelines and has been published online in military medical research on February 06, 2020.
It has attracted a lot of attention since its publication.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and information is gradually increasing based on the findings of ongoing research and experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also being constantly updated.
For example, a total of seven editions have been released by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020 with fundamental changes in some contexts in the guidelines (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.
Now that a comment has been made by Zhou et al. on our guideline, he has introduced a simple marking proposition based on his clinical experience.
His work added new evidence to our guidelines and also made valuable references to the pandemic worldwide.
We support their important work and express our gratitude.
However, their work needs to be updated according to the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (the seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), any single item of epidemiological history needs to be combined with two items of clinical manifestations to carry out a comprehensive analysis to confirm the suspected case, or three items of clinical manifestations need to be completed if the pandemic is without a clear history:
Epidemiological history: (1) the history of travel or residence in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) the history of contact with small groups of infected cases such as SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid testing in the first 14 days); (3) the history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where symptoms were reported within the past 14 days;
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with reflective features of COVID-19 infection; (3) the total number of white blood cells showing normal, reduced or low lymphocytes at an early stage.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on a suspected case containing a single item of pathogenic or serological evidence which are as follows: (1) the real-time PCR test is positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the proportional stage of SARS-CoV-2; (2) the viral complete genome sequence is showing a high symmetry from the known novel coronaviruses or IgM antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2; (3) serum testing
We can see that the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in respiratory systems or blood samples was added to the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) versions.
The pathogenic identification of the blood sample was added to the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020) editions; and then serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These revisions were based on the ongoing work of researchers who discovered an optimal nucleic acid identification kit for quick diagnosis, as well as samples from the respiratory system, including blood samples, which increased the availability of various samples, and supported bringing specific immune-positive results to confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is a lot of evidence that reminds us to be careful with imperceptible symptomatic and symptomatic patients.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou et al. should be updated, as they have classified a person with no clinical symptoms as a "low risk."
The points system needs to be verified in further clinical practice and studies.
As a conclusion, we hope that more direct evidence will come out and invite readers to provide their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases," we suggest locating and following the latest guidelines from their home countries.
Our team will also update its guidelines from time to time to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new COVID-19 deaths, highest single-day tally so far
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five more deaths from COVID-19 in a single day.
This is the highest single-day death toll from the virus so far.
As of yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported a record number of 114 active cases and 33 people who had recovered from the disease while at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded so far.
In an online news briefing, Dr Mirzadi Sabrina Flora, director of the IEDCR, reported that four men and one woman had died.
According to Dr Mirzadi, two patients were aged over 60, two between 51 and 60 and one between 41 and 50 years.
He also said that two of the dead were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on March 11.
The deceased was Jalal Saifur Rahman, a director of the Anti-Corruption Commission of Bengal and was being cared for at Kuwait Maitri Hospital, a hospital official told Anadolu Agency.
In an online video announcement on Saturday, Bangladesh Road Transport and Bridges Minister Ubaidul Qader said that road transport will be closed for a longer time than previously planned by Saturday.
The public transport ban began on March 26 and was to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of essential commodities such as medical goods, fuel and food was not stopped.
The initial cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded in two people who returned from Italy on March 8 and the wife of one of them.
On March 19, all three of them were cured.
SARS-CoV-2 cases across the world cross one million
Data from Johns Hopkins University showed that on Thursday, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide exceeded one million.

On the same day, the same day, the first coronavirus infection was reported in Malawi and the first death from coronavirus in Zambia.
North Korea claimed that as of Thursday, it was among the few countries that have so far been free of coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 10,51,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases reported in the 24 hours prior to 10 a.m. (8800 UTC) on April 4.
The US has recorded more than 2,44 thousand coronavirus cases, with at least 5,900 deaths.
According to data from Johns Hopkins University, more than 1,000 deaths have been reported in the United States due to the novel coronavirus on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced more stringent measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin on Thursday extended the city's lockdown until May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russians would continue to receive salaries without going to work until April 30.

Stores in Australia reduce the number of toilet paper that can be bought at a time
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles reduced the number of toilet paper that can be purchased at a time in all their stores nationally to two and one package, respectively.
The ALDI had also imposed a one-pack limit on Monday.
These limits were posted as messages on checkout sites and on the series' Facebook pages.
The buyers are said to have been shopping together for a situation where they need to set themselves apart most because of the fear of COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the limit of buying toilet paper for home delivery to one pack per order.
Prior to these changes, Woolworths and Coles had imposed a ban on buying a maximum of four packs at a time on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles said in a March 8 press release that despite the four-pack ban being implemented, "the stock is still being exhausted within an hour of delivery in many stores," and termed the demand unprecedented, while ALDI called it "unexpected" in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
According to a Woolworths spokesperson, there was a "serious jump" in sales last week.
Costco's store in Canberra also limited the volume to two packs last week.
To further reduce the shortfall, Coles placed orders for more large packages to suppliers and also increased the frequency of delivery. Woolworths placed additional stock orders, while ALDI raised the stock to make available early on the pre-planned Wednesday special.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailer Association, said retailers should try to increase stock, but it is difficult to do so because of the restrictions imposed by the local council at the time of truck delivery.
In such a situation when the supplier is trying to meet the demand and the number of specials has already been reduced, Russell is expected to increase production costs.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the stock was released prematurely, some stores could not operate Wednesday specials.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at the Queensland University of Technology, said that stores fill up stocks every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a heavy item, so it cannot be stocked in large numbers, and then, when the whole stock is sold, large shelves are left empty behind, which makes the feeling of shortage more rigid.
According to ABC News, Russell Zimmerman said, “It is the idea of Coles and Woolworths [that] if there were enough stuff on the shelf, and products such as toilet paper and sanitizers could [buy] and be present in large quantities, the disturbance could possibly have been reduced.”
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper, Who Gives A Crap, said on Wednesday that his stock had run out.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, the company that manufactures clean-toilet tissues, and sorbent, Solaris Paper, said they were working 24/7 to maintain supply.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that in Melbourne, where fewer auctions are already being held due to buyers celebrating the long weekend of Labor Day, some property sellers are offering free toilet paper to first bidders at the auction.
A daily published in Darwin, NT News' Thursday edition contained an eight-page insert that was cut and put into use as toilet paper.
According to a March 3 report by ABC Australia, the stores were initially unwilling to impose a ban; in this report they said they had no plans to ban purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that there is also a huge demand for other products, including masks, sanitizers, dry things, handwashes and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, the online British supermarket Okado on Sunday evening also imposed a limit of two 12-roll packs on the purchase of Andres toilet paper.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic.
The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, a disease caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, a global pandemic.
While the term "global epidemic" only means how far a disease spreads, not how dangerous its specific cases are, the WHO discussed the need to motivate governments to take action.
"All countries can change the course of this global pandemic right now.
If the country detects the disease in its response, treat the patients, keep them most isolated, place their clues and unite them," said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
“We are deeply concerned about both the alarming levels of spread and severity and the alarming levels of inaction.”
According to Dr. Tom Friedan, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this global pandemic is "unprecedented."
In comments published by CNN in February, he had said, “No respiratory virus, except influenza, has been detected in the continuous global spread.”
Gebraysis also expressed a similar view when he said, "We have not seen a global pandemic from any coronavirus to date."
"And we haven't seen a global pandemic that can be controlled at the same time," he added.
This new title of the global pandemic, given in January, follows the WHO's decision to declare the outbreak a worrying public health emergency internationally.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak, “One thing a hundred things, it’s going to get worse.”
The Associated Press reported that as of Thursday, there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide and more than 4,600 deaths as a result.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Its outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, which was declared a public health emergency internationally on 30 January 2020 and was declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, about 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in about 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered so far.
The case fatality rate in China has been assessed at 4%, while globally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications can include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to the virus to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can also be two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include: hand washing, covering your mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from others and monitoring and self-isolation for those who are suspected to be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls and convenience closures.
The pandemic has generated serious global socio-economic turmoil, prompted the postponement or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events, and a massive drop in supplies from panic buying by people.
Schools and universities in 193 countries are closed on a nationwide or local basis, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, East and Southeast Asian origin and others with form-colored, and others from regions with more virus cases.
Low travel and heavy industry closures have led to reductions in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in China's Wuhan (the capital of Hubei province) reported mass cases of pneumonia occurring for unknown reasons on 31 December 2019 and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were linked to the bulk market of Hunan seafood and therefore the virus is considered to be a zoonotic origin.
The outbreak spreading virus is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus with close association with bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. Later on 1 December 2019, the first known person with symptoms was detected to fall ill, and the following person did not have any contact with a group of meat marketers.
Two-thirds of the initial group of cases reported in December 2019 were found to have links with the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report by the South China Morning Post reported that a case was of a 55-year-old man from Hubei province on 17 November 2019, which may be the first case. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that with a decrease in new cases in China, there has been a sudden increase in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had for the first time exceeded the number of new cases within China.
Very little information of cases may have been recorded especially in people with mild symptoms.
By February 26, relatively few cases were reported among the youth, of whom 19 years of age and under were 2.4% of cases worldwide. Patrick Wallace, the chief scientific adviser to the United Kingdom, estimated that 60% of the British population would need to be infected before the effective group received immunity.
Cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and according to the official protocol whose tests have been confirmed positive.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland had official policies not to test only people with mild symptoms.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, as of January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections were not detected, and that these unexplained infections were the source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infected people in Italy was significantly higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimate of the original reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most of the people infected with COVID-19 have recovered.
Among those who do not recover, the time from the development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, COVID-19 had caused about 97,000 deaths.
In China, as of February 5, about 80% of the deaths were in people over 60, and 75% of the cases were pre-existing health conditions, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The official count of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refers to those found to be positive for COVID, according to official protocols.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 can be very high, as it may not include people who die without testing such as at home, in a nursing home, etc.
Italy's partial statistics found that the additional death toll during the pandemic was 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death toll.
A spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged "we know that [the so-called death number] has been put in place", a statement supported by descriptive information of the low count in the U.S. Such neutrons are often in epidemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred on February 14 in France.
As of February 28, outside mainland China, Iran, South Korea and Italy each recorded more than a dozen deaths.
As of March 13, deaths were reported in more than forty countries and regions on every continent except Antarctica. A number of measures are commonly used to determine the amount of mortality.
These numbers vary by region and time, and are influenced by the amount of testing, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, time and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health since the initial outbreak. The death-case ratio shows the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a certain time interval.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the global death-case ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
This number varies according to the area.
In China, the death-case ratio has declined from 17.3% (for those with symptoms starting from 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms starting after 1 February 2020). Other measures include the Case Fatality Rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed with a disease, and the percentage of people diagnosed with a death-infected disease (IFR).
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection to case recovery.
Many academics have attempted to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The University of Oxford's Center for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the infection mortality rate for a pandemic as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper estimate of this range is consistent with the results of a statistical study analyzing the impact of testing on the first randomized trial of COVID-19 and CFR projections in Germany.
The WHO claims that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak is uncertain and may vary according to location.
"When left uncontrolled, infectious outbreaks generally stabilize and begin to decline when there are no available nutrients for the disease," said McKees Bonnie of Penn State University.
It's almost impossible to predict when it will happen."
Zhong Nanshan, a senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, argued that "it could end by June" if all countries followed the WHO's advice on measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kuchersky of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 is "probably going to be circulating for a year or two."
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be needed “until a vaccine becomes available (possibly 18 months or more)”.
"I don't think it's likely that this coronavirus will end completely, because it's very easily transmitted," said William Shefner of Vanderbilt University, and it could "turn into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year."
The severity of the return will depend on the group immunity and the range of mutations.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and infected people can be symptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include: fatigue, respiratory mucus production (cough), reduced sense of smell, shortness of breath, pain in the muscles and joints, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, blood clots, diarrhea or blue eyes. According to the WHO, about one in six people become seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms as difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden twitching, difficulty waking up, and blueness of the face or lips; immediate medical care is advised when these symptoms are present. More development of this disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, death.
Some of the infected people may be symptomatic, with no clinical symptoms, but the test results confirm the infection, so the researchers have issued advice that people with close contact with confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and checked so that the infection is eliminated.
The Chinese estimate of the eccentric ratio ranges from some to 44%.
The general morbidity period (the time between infection and the onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is most commonly five days. An example of uncertainty, the estimate of the fraction of people with COVID-19, who had lost their sense of smell, was initially 30% and later reduced to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still being determined.
The disease is believed to be spread mainly by small droplets generated during close contact and coughing, sneezing or talking; when close contact is within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that drops can go from 4.5 m (15 ft) to 8.2 m (27 ft) without a coughing mouth.
Some people have suggested that the virus can also be transmitted by small drops that occur while speaking that stay in the air for longer periods of time. Breathing drops can also occur while exhaling, including when talking, although the virus is not normally airborne.
Drops can go into the mouth or nose of people who are nearby or possibly through inhalation in the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as tuberculin penetration and heart pulmonary therapy (CPR) may cause respiration and thus airborne spread.
It can also spread when a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there are also concerns that it can be spread by feces, its risk is considered low.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of faecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although communication may be possible before the symptoms appear and at the later stages of the disease.
Tests for people's disease have come positive for three days before the onset of symptoms, which suggests that transmission is possible before significant symptoms develop.
Only a few reports of symptomatic cases confirmed in the laboratory are present, but agnostic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact tracing investigations.
According to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, a person usually infects two to three other individuals. The virus survives on surfaces for hours to days.
In particular, the virus was found detectable for three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, up to a day on cardboard, and up to four hours on copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature. Tests for pets and other animals have come positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that the virus can be transmitted from animals to humans, although British authorities recommend washing their hands after exposure to animals, such as after exposure to other surfaces touched by an infected person.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with the group of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All the features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the corresponding coronaviruses present in nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies from household soap, which decompresses its protective cover. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to be a virus of animal origin.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus is genetically related to two bat-derived breeds of the genus Betacoronavirus, group of subgenres Serbecovirus (Venus B).
It is 96% similar to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13) at the entire genome level.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid difference in some parts of the genome sequences between viruses from pangolins and viruses from humans.
Yet in comparison to the entire genome, the normal genetic content between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be a maximum of 92%, which is insufficient for pangolins to validate intermediate nutrients.
The infection can be detected temporarily by the virus on the basis of symptoms, although the confirmation is ultimately from reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or CT images of the infected secretion.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although many of its image features are less specific with it being similar to other pneumoniaes and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology has recommended that "CT should not be used as a primary test to check for or diagnose COVID-19."
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first version of which has been released on January 17.
This test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR).
This test can be done on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours to days.
In general, this test is performed on the nasopharynx, but a sore throat can also be used. Many laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect the immune system.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these have been proven to be accurate enough to be widely approved for use.
A serological test developed by Celex in the US has only been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories.
Characteristic image characteristics on radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of symptomatic people include asymmetric peripheral ground glass opacity and absent pulmonary secretion.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of imagery findings for confirmed cases.
Due to similarities with other infections such as adenovirus, without confirmation by PCR, there is a limited specificity of imagery in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and demonstrated that although imagery is less specific to infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its idea as a screening tool in epidemiological areas.
Artificial knowledge-based winding neural networks have been developed to detect the imaging characteristics of the virus with both radiographs and CT.
To prevent transmission of the disease, strategies include maintaining overall good personal hygiene, avoiding hand washing, touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing in a tissue and putting that tissue directly into the trash bin.
People who may already have the infection are advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Many governments have banned or advised all non-essential travel to countries and regions affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some members of the community do not know where and how they got infected. Care providers caring for an infected person are recommended to take standard precautions, take contact precautions and protect the eyes. Contact tracing is an important way for health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent further transmission.
The use of location data of mobile phones by governments for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, for which Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement for the limitations on such surveillance.
Various mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to log a user's proximity to other cellphones.
Users then receive a message if they are in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions about ways to prevent infection are spreading; for example, rubbing the nose and garnishing with a mouthwash are not effective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine available, although many organizations are working to develop a vaccine.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent transmission of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands appear dirty; before eating; and after sneezing, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soaps, which burst its protective bubbles.
Additionally, the CDC recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not readily available.
WHO advises people to avoid touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected by multiple solutions, including 62–71% ethanol, 50–100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5% povidone-iodine (within a minute of contact with disinfectant for a stainless steel surface).
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and crohexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that all areas such as offices, toilets, public places, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by sick persons should be disinfected if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed on a facility such as an office or day care.
Health organizations recommend that people bend their mouth and nose elbows or cover with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and then dispose of any tissue immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for people who may be infected, as wearing masks may limit the amount of inhaled droplets and the distance to be covered when speaking, sneezing and coughing.
The WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “Masks can reduce people’s tendency to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene.” Masks are also recommended to be used by people who are taking care of a person with the disease.
The WHO recommends wearing masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those who are caring for a person with COVID-19, although they also acknowledge that wearing a mask can help people avoid touching their face.
Many countries have begun to encourage the use of face masks by ordinary individuals.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends wearing a non-medical face mask made of cloth. China particularly recommends the use of disposable medical masks by normal healthy people, especially when they come in close contact with other people (1 meter (3 feet) or less.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask when using public transport or staying in crowded places.
Thailand's health authorities are encouraging people to make cloth face masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from wearing masks or going out in public without covering their noses and mouths.
On March 16, Vietnam requested everyone to wear a face mask when they go to public areas to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory for all people entering the grocery store to wear face masks.
Israel has asked all citizens to wear face masks when they go to the public sector.
Since mid-March, Taiwan, which produces ten million masks per day, has made it mandatory for passengers to wear face masks on April 1 in trains and intercity buses.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a face mask while going out, while it is also recommended to make a homemade face mask for those who cannot afford to buy a face mask.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also called physical distancing) involves infection control functions, which aim to slow the spread of the disease by reducing close contact between individuals.
Its methods include quarantine; travel restrictions; and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping centers.
Individuals can apply methods of social distancing by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using greeting without contact, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments are now making social distancing mandatory or recommended in areas affected by the outbreak.
Rapid reductions in the maximum population recommended by U.S. government bodies and health organizations ranged from 250 people (if there was no known COVID-19 transmission in an area) to 50 people, and later to up to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Making contact with older adults and individuals with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and immunocompromised immune system makes the risk of serious diseases and complications higher. So making contact with the contact is the "sustainable risk of serious diseases and complications". It is recommended by the CDC to start using the term "other bodies of health" and stay at home as much distance as possible, in areas with the end of March 2020.
The use of the term “social distancing” generated implications that, instead of encouraging people to stay in touch with others through alternative means, they should adopt complete social segregation. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.
These include recommendations for having sex with only the person living with you, who does not have symptoms of the virus or the virus.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for people diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who are suspected to be infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Several governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for the entire population living in the affected areas.
The strictest self-quarantine instructions have been issued in high-risk groups.
Individuals who may have come in contact with a person infected with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region with widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of the last potential risk.
The strategies of control of an outbreak are prevention or suppression, and mitigation.
Prevention is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and is aimed at detecting infected people as well as implementing other measures and vaccinations to control the infection so as to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it is not possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts go to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and reduce its effects on the health system and society.
The combination of both prevention and mitigation measures can be done at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures, so that the epidemic can be reversed by reducing the original breeding number to 1. Part of managing an outbreak of infectious disease is trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as reducing the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of health services cracking and gives more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-Medical interventions that can manage outbreaks include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks and self-quarantine; stricter community measures intended to create physical distancing, such as closeting schools and canceling mass gathering programs. The interventions were aimed at ensuring greater community participation; as well as environmental measures.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea launched large-scale investigations and localized quarantines, and issued warnings on the movement of infected individuals.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed huge fines on those who failed to do so.
Taiwan increased the production of face masks and penalized hoarding of medical supplies. Simulations for Great Britain and the US show that there are major challenges in mitigation (slowing the spread of the pandemic but not stopping) and suppression (reversing the development of the pandemic).
Optimum mitigation policies can reduce the demand for extreme health care by 2/3 and death by half, but even then hundreds of people die and health systems collapse.
Suppression can be prioritized, but it needs to be maintained until the virus is spreading to the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if it is the first), otherwise the transmission from laxity in measures returns faster.
The long-term intervention for the suppression of the pandemic generates social and economic costs.
No specific antiviral drugs are approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing of existing drugs.
Taking cold-drinking medications without prescription, drinking fluids and relaxing can help ease symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory support may be required.
The results may be worse with the use of steroids.
Many compounds that are already approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being tested for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
According to the WHO, some "traditional and home remedies" may relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Enhancing capacity and adapting health care to the needs of COVID-19 patients, described by the WHO as a fundamental outbreak response measure.
ECDC and the WHO’s European Regional Office have issued guidelines for the transfer of resources to hospitals and primary health care services at multiple levels, including: focusing on laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, cancelling selective procedures whenever possible, isolating and isolating COVID-19 infected patients, and increasing intensive care capabilities by personnel training and increasing available ventilators and beds.
There are many opinions about where the first case (so-called patient zero) might have originated.
The first known case of novel coronavirus was identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China on December 1, 2019.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei increased gradually.
These were mostly associated with the wholesale market of Hunan sea-food, which also sold to living animals, and one opinion is that the virus came from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, it is of zoonotic origin. The unknown-caused pneumonia group was observed on 26 December and which was reported to JiaanDhu, who was treated by the physician Zhang Jixian at the Hubei Provincial Hospital, on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital alerted their colleagues about the "SARS-like coronavirus."
Police warned eight doctors, including Lee Wenliang, on charges of spreading false rumours, and another doctor, I Feyn, was reprimanded by his superiors.
The Wuhan City Health Commission later issued a public notice on December 31 and informed the WHO.
Health authorities in Wuhan were informed of a number of cases of unknown pneumonia, resulting in an investigation launched in early January. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases nearly doubled every seven and a half days.
In early January 2020 and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces due to the Chinese New Year being the transportation center and major rail exchange.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases a day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later official statistics show that as of 20 January 2020, 6,174 people had already developed symptoms. As of 26 March, the US has overtaken China and Italy with the highest confirmed cases in the world. As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 people have recovered.
There is at least one case in about 200 countries and territories.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen region have banned free movement and established border controls.
The national responses include preventive measures such as quarantine (domestic stay orders, shelter orders at their place, or lockdowns) and curfews. As of April 2, about 300 million people in the U.S. or about 90% of the population are in some form of lockdown, more than 50 million people in the Philippines are in lockdown, about 59 million people in South Africa are in lockdown, and 1.3 million in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of lockdown, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later - about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 has been detected on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report shows that the first case occurred on 17 November.
The doctor, Zhang Jiaxian, saw a group of pneumonia cases for unknown reasons on December 26, after which his hospital informed the Wuhan Jiangnan CDC on December 27.
Early genetic testing of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
A public notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31.
Who was informed on the same day.
Following these reports, doctors in Wuhan were warned by police to "spread rumors" about the outbreak.
The Chinese National Health Commission initially claimed there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a furious campaign to stop the spread of the virus, which was called "people's war" by <0x58>i Jinping, the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party.
Described as "the largest quarantine in human history," a siege zone was announced in Wuhan on January 23 to prevent movement, which was extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a total of 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles was banned in the city.
The Chinese New Year (January 25) celebrations were canceled in many places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Hosseinson Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Later another hospital, Leishenson Hospital, was built, to handle additional patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China also converted 14 other facilities such as conference centers and stadiums in Wuhan into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government set up additional measures to prevent the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health declarations for travelers and extending the spring festival holiday.
Schools and universities across the country were also closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macau established a number of measures, especially in relation to schools and universities.
Measures to work remotely were established in many Chinese regions.
Travel restrictions were imposed inside and outside Hubei.
Public transport was modified, and museums across China were temporarily closed.
People's movement was controlled in many cities, and it is estimated that about 760 million people (over half the population) suffered some form of external ban. After the outbreak came to its global stage in March, Chinese authorities took strict steps to prevent the virus from "coming" from other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travelers entering the city. On March 23, only one case was transmitted domestically over the last five days in mainland China, in this example through a passenger returning from Istanbul to Guangzhou.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang informed that the spread of domestically transmitted cases has been basically stopped and the outbreak in China has been controlled.
In addition to Wuhan, travel restrictions were relaxed on the same day two months after the lockdown was imposed. The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on 26 March 2020 that entry for visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from 28 March, as well as no specific details on when this policy will end.
Those who want to enter China will have to apply for a visa at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen on March 30 and provided economic stimulus packages for businesses. The State Council declared a day of mourning on April 4, beginning with a three-minute national silence, which was at the time of the Qingming festival, although the central government asked families to pay tribute online, following physical distancing to avoid the new COVID-19 outbreak.
On January 20, 2020, the spread of COVID-19 from China to South Korea was confirmed.
The nation's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely related to the gathering in Diego of a new religious movement known as the Shinchiyoji Church of Jesus.
The Shinchiyoji devotees coming from Wuhan were suspicious of the origins of the outbreak.
As of 22 February, 1,261 or about 13% of the church’s 9,336 followers reported symptoms. South Korea declared the highest level of alert on 23 February 2020.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, which increased to 3,150 on February 29.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after tests confirmed that three soldiers were positive for the virus.
The airline programs were also affected and so were changed. The program that South Korea introduced was considered the largest and best organized program in the world to check the population for the virus and isolate any infected people as well as to detect and quarantine those who contacted them.
The screening methods included mandatory self-information of symptoms by new international arrivals through mobile applications, quick testing for the virus with results available the next day, and increased testing capacity to test 20,000 people per day.
South Korea’s program is considered a success in controlling the outbreak despite not quarantined entire cities. South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans either signed petitions calling for Moon's impeachment, claiming mismanagement of the outbreak by the government, or praised his response.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest one-day cases in four weeks.
On March 29, it was informed that from April 1, all new foreign arrivals will be quarantined for two weeks.
According to media reports on April 1, South Korea has received requests for virus testing assistance from 121 different countries.
Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Kom on February 19, where two people died later that day, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education.
Early measures announced by the government included closing of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events, and Friday prayers, and universities, higher education institutions, and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion riyals to combat the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on February 26, 2020 that there was no plan to quarantine areas affected by the outbreak and only individuals would be quarantined.
The plan to limit travel between cities was announced in March, although heavy traffic continued between cities before the Persian New Year Navroz.
As of 16 March 2020, Shia shrines in Kom were open to pilgrims. During February, Iran became the hub of virus transmission after China.
Amid claims of concealing the extent of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries found their cases to be linked to Iran as of February 28, indicating that by that day the amount of the outbreak could be more severe than 388 cases reported by the Iranian government.
The Iranian parliament was closed when 23 of its 290 members tested positive for the virus on March 3.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch also urged Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful protest and temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
It said that closed institutions such as containment centres are at greater risk of spreading the virus, which also lacks adequate medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, the highest number recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
By March 17, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died of the disease.
By March 23, Iran was reporting 50 new cases every hour and a new death every ten minutes due to the coronavirus.
According to a WHO official, there could be five times more cases than the number of cases being reported in Iran.
It has also been suggested that U.S. sanctions on Iran may have affected the country's financial ability to respond to the viral outbreak.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded that economic sanctions be eased for countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy on January 31, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to grow rapidly, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
Starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February, an unrelated group of COVID-19 cases was detected. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a new judicial-law to contain the outbreak, which quarantined more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "In populated areas, entry and exit will not be provided.
Work activities and sports programs in those areas have already been ordered to be postponed. “On March 4, the Italian government ordered the complete closure of all schools and universities across the country, as 100 deaths occurred in Italy.
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, were to be held without witnesses until April, but on March 9, all games were completely postponed for at least a month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered to stop almost all business activities except supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anaesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations regarding protocols for employable, severe patients sorting.

As of April 5, with most cases occurring in the Lombardy region, Italy had 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths, and 21,815 recoveries.
A CNN report indicated that a combination of Italy's large elderly population and the inability to test people who had the virus by that time may have contributed to higher mortality.
The United Kingdom's response to the virus initially emerged as the most relaxed of the affected countries, and as of March 18, 2020, the British government had not imposed any form of social distancing or large-scale quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism for the alleged lack of speed and intensity in response to concerns faced by the public. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson advised to stop all non-essential travel and social contact, suggesting people to work from home wherever possible and avoid places like pubs, restaurants, and theaters.
On March 20, the government announced that all entertainment establishments such as pubs and gyms should be shut down as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of the wages of workers to the extent of <0xC2><0xA3>2,500 per month to prevent unemployment in crisis. On March 23, the Prime Minister announced strict social distancing measures, including restricting travel and outdoor activity to more than two people.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were enforced by the police through fines imposed and sporadic crowding.
Most businesses were ordered to close except for businesses considered "essential", which include supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, petrol stations and garages.

On 28 January 2020, the Centers for Disease Control – the U.S. government’s premier public health institution – announced that they had developed their test kit.
Despite doing so, the U.S. made a slow start in testing, which at the time made it difficult to understand the actual extent of the outbreak.
The trial was interrupted by defective test kits manufactured by the federal government in February, the lack of federal government approval for non-government testing kits (by academics, companies and hospitals) by the end of February, and restrictive criteria for people to qualify for a trial by the beginning of March (after which a doctor's order was required).
As of February 27, The Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the US.
By March 13, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted.
On 22 March, The Associated Press reported: “Many people who have symptoms and have a doctor’s order, waited for hours or days for a trial.” Following the first death reported in Washington state on 29 February, Governor J Inslee declared a state of emergency, an action that was soon followed by other states.

On the other hand, Chinese aid has been well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On April 2, the World Bank launched emergency aid campaigns for developing countries.
WHO has lauded the efforts of Chinese authorities in managing and containing the pandemic.
The WHO noted the difference between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, where Chinese authorities were accused of secrecy that hampered the prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis where the central government provided "regular updates to avoid fear before the Lunar New Year holidays."
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to impose a transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galia commented that while “definitely the WHO did not recommend the first WHO after the outbreak” it was “a very important sign of the WHO’s commitment to prevent the epidemic in the WHO’s first time since the 2009 outbreak of the WHO’s “health care at the place where it’s most concentrated” – and called it “unpreced out 30 January in human health history”.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that PHEIC was the cause of "the risk of global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries without strong health systems."
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros said "there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade" and that "WHO does not recommend limiting trade and movement."
On February 5, the WHO appealed to the global community to contribute $675 million to strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the need to help countries that do not have "systems set up to detect people infected with the virus, even if it was about to emerge."
Tedros further announced in statements, that “we are only as strong as our weakest link” and urged the international community to “invest today or pay more later.” On February 11, the WHO established the name of the COVID-19 disease in a press conference.
On the same day, Tedros said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to provide "the power of the entire UN system in response."
As a result, a crisis management team from the United Nations was activated, which coordinated the response of the entire United Nations, which according to the WHO would enable them to “focus on health response, while other agencies could use their expertise to bear the broader social, economic and developmental implications of the outbreak.”
On 14 February, a joint mission team led by WHO with China, to assist in domestic management and to host meetings with workshops and major national-level institutions should be prepared to say that the WHO should be "prepared to be a pandemic" but to be "prepared to be at the top of the WHO's efforts to be a pandemic", and to "provide that WHO experts at the provincial and county levels including urban and rural arrangements" to visit the region, China.
In response to a developing outbreak in Iran, the WHO sent a joint mission team to assess the situation. On February 28, WHO authorities said that the threat of coronavirus will be assessed globally from "high" to "very high", which is the highest level of vigilance and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO’s health emergency program, warned in a statement that “this is a reality check for every government on earth: it’s time to wake up.”
This virus may be coming your way and you need to be prepared," urging that measures of the right response can help the world avoid "its worst."
Ryan added that current statistics have not convinced public health authorities to declare a global pandemic, adding that such a declaration would mean "we are essentially accepting that every human on earth will come into contact with that virus."
On March 11, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The DG said the WHO was "deeply concerned by both the alarming levels of spread and severity and the dangerous levels of inaction". The WHO has faced major criticism as inadequate management of the pandemic, including delays in declaring a public health emergency and categorizing the virus as an epidemic.
The rebuttal, signed by 733,000 people as of April 6, included a petition for the resignation of WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts emphasized respecting the rights of every person during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group said everyone is entitled to life-saving interventions and it is the responsibility of the government.
The group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should never be used as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
Experts stressed that everyone, including people with disabilities, minority groups, elderly people, internally displaced people, people living in homeless, extreme poverty, people living in detention, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government assistance, has the right to health.
International government organizations are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has launched a platform to provide perspectives and advice on policy responses in a timely and comprehensive manner in countries around the world.
From strengthening policies to health systems and addressing the effects of travel and restrictions, the digital hub includes a country policy tracker, and aims to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government's U.S., UK minister for cabinet office Michael Gove, and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's son Eduardo Bolsonaro have criticised the U.S. government's handling of the pandemic that began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were dismissed for dealing with quarantine efforts in central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the political body's response to the outbreak in those areas.
Some commentators believe the move was aimed at protecting <0x58>i Jinping, the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, rejected a pre-acceptance of the coronavirus outbreak that started in Wuhan, which was in favor of conspiracies about COVID-19 originating from the US or Italy.
Donald Trump's U.S. administration has referred to the coronavirus as a "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus," saying China's "control system has now turned a virus into a global pandemic", which some critics have called racism and "disgusting from their administration's failure to stop the disease."
The Daily Beast received a U.S. government wire that underlines communication moratorium with clear origins in the National Security Council, quoting as a strategy that "everything is about China."
We are being asked to try to send this message in any way, including press conferences and television appearances. “Outlets like Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that China’s attempt to send aid to virus-hit countries is part of the propaganda to increase global influence.”
European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that it has "a geopolitical component that includes the struggle for influence through reshuffle and the politics of 'liberty'."
Borrell also said that “China is aggressively advancing the message that, unlike the US, it is a responsible and reliable partner.”
China has also called on the United States to lift sanctions from Syria, Venezuela and Iran, allegedly sending aid to the latter two countries.
Jack Ma's 100,000 masks donation to Cuba was blocked by U.S. sanctions on April 3.
U.S. authorities have also been accused of converting intended aid to other nations to their own country.
And mask-related disputes have surfaced between Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and other countries, such as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has seized hundreds of ventilators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of EU solidarity with the coronavirus-hit Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the European Union, said that "only China responded bilaterally."
Certainly, this is not a good sign of European solidarity.”
On March 22, following a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged for the Russian military to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment.
Italy's La Stampa newspaper cited an unnamed "high-level political source" saying that 80 percent of Russia's aid was "useless or very little of Italy's use."
The source accused Russia of "geo-political and diplomatic" flattering.
Lombardi President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio refuted media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia sent medical aid materials to the US from a cargo plane.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that “while offering assistance to American allies [Putin] believes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials increase production, they will also be able to repay returns if necessary.”
The largest NATO war exercise, NATO "Defender 2020", will be held at a low level after the end of the Cold War in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states.
Secretary-General of Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: “In the current public-health crisis, it is endangering not only the lives of the soldiers of the United States and many European countries but also the residents of the countries participating in it where they are working.” The Iranian government has been greatly affected by the virus, with about two dozen members of parliament infected as well as fifteen other current political ones.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders seeking help on 14 March 2020, stating that his country, as a result of U.S. sanctions against Iran, is struggling to fight the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets. This outbreak has driven the U.S. from universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and other wealthier countries, including high-level funding for public health.
Political analysts speculated that this could negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations deteriorated due to the pandemic between Japan and South Korea.
Japan's "clear and passive quarantine efforts" were criticized by South Korea when Japan announced that anyone arriving from South Korea would be placed in quarantine for two weeks at sites designated by the government.
South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans either signed petitions calling for Moon’s impeachment, claiming mismanagement of the outbreak by the government, or praised its response. This pandemic has prompted countries to pass emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it could help governments strengthen their hold on power.
In Hungary, its parliament voted to allow Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, to rule indefinitely, suspending elections to parliament as well as punishing those who were found to be dealing with the virus and crisis and spreading false information about the government.
The outbreak of the coronavirus has been blamed for several instances of supply shortages, arising from the use of tools to fight the outbreak globally, fear-induced purchases, and disruptions in factory and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning about a shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to rising consumer demand and supplier disruptions.
Many areas also saw panic-induced shopping conditions, which led to a shortage of groceries essentials such as food, toilet paper, and bottled water from the shelves, leading to a shortage of supplies.
The technology industry in particular has been warned about delays in transportation of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand has led to a twenty-fold increase in the normal price and also a delay in supply of medical items for four to six months.
This has led to a lack of personal protective equipment worldwide, prompting the WHO to warn that it would put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic gave Dyego shoppers a new opportunity to sell Australian products in China.
This activity created a shortage of infant formula in some supermarkets and was later banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the high demand for food products in the Wuhan region, both regions have survived the extreme shortage of food.
Measures taken by China and Italy against the hoarding and illegal trade of important products have been successful, preventing the excessive shortage of food that was projected in Europe as well as North America.
Northern Italy has not seen a major decline in its significant agricultural output, but prices may rise, according to industry representatives.
Empty food shelves were only temporarily seen in the city of Wuhan, when Chinese government officials issued shoe-meat reserves to ensure adequate nutrition of the population.
Similar laws in Italy make it mandatory for food producers to keep reserves for such emergencies.
The global economy in China has suffered losses: According to a media report on March 16, government measures to contain the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell 20.5%, causing a deep injury to the economy in China in the first two months of 2020.
Since mainland China is a major economy and manufacturing hub, the outbreak of the virus has been considered to be a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agatha Demaris of the Economist Intelligence Unit has predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clear image emerges on the possible consequences.
In January 2020, some analysts speculated that the economic impact of the pandemic on global growth could exceed the SARS outbreak of 2002-2004.
An estimate from an expert at the University of Washington in St. Louis reported an impact of $300<0x2B> billion on the world's supply chain that could last for two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) allegedly "bought" after a sharp fall in oil prices due to lower demand from China.
The global stock market fell on February 24 due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
Due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak on February 27, various U.S. stock indices, including the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 Index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, reported the sharpest decline since 2008, with Dow dropping 1,191 points, the biggest one-day drop since the 2007–08 financial crisis.
All three indices fell more than 10% that week.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's omnipotent creditworthiness fixation, but maintained a negative expectation.
Stocks fell again on the basis of coronavirus fears, the biggest decline occurred on March 16.
Many people believe that there is a possibility of economic slowdown.
Economist Mohammed al-Arian praised the timely emergency measures of central banks and states.
Central banks are reacting more quickly than the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the worst-hit areas due to the advice of governments to ban travel, close public places, including tourist attractions, stop any travel around the world.
As a result, several airlines, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Quants, have cancelled flights due to low demand, while British regional airline Flybe has collapsed.
Its impact on the cruise line industry was by far the most seen.
Several train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The timing of this pandemic also coincides with the timing of the major travel session, Chunyun, associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
A large number of events, including annual New Year celebrations, were canceled by national and regional governments, as well as private companies independently closing their shops and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Several lunar New Year celebrations and tourist attractions have been closed in Beijing to prevent mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities, and territories, authorities extended New Year's holiday until February 10, directing most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These sectors represented 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong raised its infectious disease response level to the highest and declared an emergency, with schools shut down by March and canceled their New Year celebrations. The retail sector has been hit globally, with store hours falling or temporarily closed.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America have fallen by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a 50-60% drop.
In March, pedestrians to shopping centres declined by 33-43% compared to February.
Shopping mall operators around the world took additional measures, such as increasing sanitation, setting up thermal scanners to check shoppers’ temperature, and canceling ceremonies. According to a UN Economic Commission for Latin America estimate, the pandemic-induced recession could leave 14 and 22 million people in Latin America in extreme poverty who would not be in that situation without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the pandemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China’s nearly 300 million rural migrant workers are stuck at home in inland provinces or stranded in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The coronavirus outbreak could cut 47 million jobs in the U.S. and the unemployment rate could fall by as much as 32%, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Several million migrant workers in India have become unemployed (who are paid through daily wages in Spain). The Angus Reed Institute survey found that 44% of Canada’s households experienced some kind of unemployment in March after the lockdown.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers had applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers had applied for a universal loan scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany have sent their workers on government-funded short-term working plans called Kurjarbet.
The German short-term work compensation plan has been adopted by France and Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been greatly affected by the pandemic, which has affected the operations of organizations globally as well as individuals working and working independently.
Organizations in the arts and culture sector strive to provide the community with access to cultural heritage, maintain the safety of its employees and the public and, where possible, to support artists in their (primarily public-funded) mission.
As of March 2020, museums, libraries, exhibition venues, and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely, with their exhibitions, ceremonies, and exhibitions being cancelled or postponed.
In response, intense efforts were made to provide alternative services through the digital platform. Recently another rapidly growing result of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as concerts and technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry has also experienced disruption. The Vatican announced that the observation of the Holy Week in Rome, which takes place during the last week of Lent’s Christian mourning session, has been canceled.
Many bishops-areas have recommended older Christians stay at home rather than attend mass on Sunday; some churches have provided church services via radio, online live streaming, or television, while others are offering drive-in worship.
Rome's Roman Catholic bishops-area, along with closing their churches and prayer halls and evacuating Christian pilgrims from St. Peter's Square, other religious bodies have also cancelled services in churches, mosques, Jewish synagogues, temples and gurdwaras and restricted public gatherings.
Iran's health ministry announced the cancellation of Friday's prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and later closed the shrines, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as citizens to holy places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant disruption in the sports calendar worldwide since World War II.
Most major sporting events, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019–20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season, and the 2019-20 NHL season, have been canceled or postponed.
The outbreak disrupted the plan for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which was originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but not beyond the summer of 2021". The casino and other gaming venues around the world have been closed and live poker tournaments have been postponed or cancelled.
Due to this many gamblers are adopting online methods, with many online gambling sites reporting a significant increase in new sign-up rates. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups suspending or canceling concerts.
Many big theaters, such as Broadway, also suspended all performances.
Some artists have discovered ways to continue and share work on the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performance, such as making live streaming of concerts or web-based "sessions" to promote artists' performance, distribution, and their work.
Online, many coronavirus-themed internet memes have spread in the form of humor and distraction amid uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, increasing bias towards people of Chinese and East Asian origin, and people with hotspots in Europe, the US, and other countries, xenophobia and racism have been noted.
Many countries, especially Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region, have seen incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility.
In information from February (when most cases were still limited to China), racist sentiments of Chinese people deserve to get the virus in different groups around the world or receive justifiable punishment, have been documented.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their regional origins.
Online and offline help is available for Chinese people and for people in virus-stricken areas.
Following the progress of the outbreak in new hotspot countries, people in Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe outbreak of COVID-19, may also experience suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed petitions to prevent Chinese people from entering their countries in an effort to prevent the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag <0x23>ChineseDontComeToJapan was trending on Twitter.
Chinese people as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the U.S. have reported increased levels of racist abuse as well as attacks.
US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as a "Chinese virus," which has been considered racist and anti-Chinese by critics.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign electors from Wuhan to Novi Sanjari.
Students coming from northeastern India, bordering China, who study in major Indian cities, have reportedly experienced harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, president of the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "so God has avenged them."
The Chinese Consulate in Kolkata later condemned the comment, calling it "wrong". In China, xenophobia and racism towards non-Chinese residents were fueled by the pandemic, describing foreigners as targeted for "foreign waste" and "disposal."
Many newspapers with paywalls removed them for some or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Several scientific publishers provided scientific papers related to outbreaks with open access.
Some scientists chose to quickly share their results on preprint servers like BioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 viruses include methods for detecting the presence of the virus and for detecting antibodies produced as a response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by the RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is designed only to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm recent or active infections.
Immunosuppressive detection (rhythmology) can be used for both diagnosis and monitoring of people.
Immunization tests show how many people have had the disease, including those who were too mild to indicate symptoms or who were symptomatic.
The results of this investigation can determine the exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity in people.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country had reliable data on the spread of the virus in people.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population and there are considerable disparities over how many tests have been done in different countries.
This disparity is also likely to significantly affect the reported case fatality rate, which is likely to be significantly higher in some countries.
Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including samples of nasopharyngeal faeces or mucus can be checked.
Results are usually available in a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test done with throat swabs is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
The virus may later disappear from the throat, while it continues to grow in the lungs.
For infected people tested in the second week, alternatively the sample material can then be taken from the airway through the suction catheter or used in coughing.
One of the earliest PCR tests using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was developed in January 2020 in Berlin in Charit<0xC3><0xA9>, and became the basis for the distribution of 250,000 kits by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed the test kit until 23 January 2020. The South Korean company Kogan Biotech developed a clinical category, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test kit (PowerCheck coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
It explores the "E" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses and the RdRp gene specifically found in SARS-CoV-2 by the RESTL-CoV-2 laboratory. In China, the BGI group is conducting the National Medical Products Administration of China's National Medical Products Administration (PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 testing kits) from the United States, one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval of the COVID-19 vaccine.
In one of the older versions of the test kit, one of the three genetic reagents caused unexplained results, and caused problems with the testing on the CDC in Atlanta; this led to an average of less than 100 samples a day of successfully processed samples throughout February 2020.
The tests using two components were not considered reliable till 28th February 2020 and till then state and local laboratories were not allowed to start testing.
The testing was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authority. Professional labs in the US began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced availability across the country of COVID-19 testing based on RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 testing available across the country till 9 March 2020.
No quantity limits were announced; the aggregation and processing of samples should be done in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, COVID-19 testing was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, this check was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic received information to develop checks to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020 Rosh Diagnostics received approval from the FDA for high-volume checks that could be done within 3.5 hours, as a result of about 4,12 checks in a 24-hour period from a machine.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations to Holistic, Labcorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Sheffield received the EUA for a test from the FDA that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test in which isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology is used instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of variable temperature cycles, this method can give positive results in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 such machines in the U.S. and Abbott wants to increase manufacturing for 50,000 tests per day. A testing kit is being developed in Taiwan that uses monoclonal immunoglobulin that connects specifically to the nucleocarcassidy protein (N protein) of Novel Coronavirus. With the hope that this intense influenza could result in 15 minutes of testing.
A literature review in March 2020 concluded that “the early stage of chest radiographs has less clinical significance, while CT [computerized tomography] findings may be available even before the onset of symptoms.”
The specific features of CT include bilateral multilobber ground-glass opacity with peripheral, asymmetric and post-distribution.
As the disease progresses, the effects of subpolar, crazie paving and consolidation develop.
A study comparing PCR to CT at the source point of the current pandemic, Wuhan, has suggested that it is remarkably more sensitive than PCR, despite being less specific, with many portrayal characteristics similar to other pneumonia and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that “CT should not be used as a check or first-line check for a diagnosis of COVID-19.” As of March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for a primary check.
Part of the immune response to infection involves the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
They can be used to determine the resistance that starts in individuals 7 days after the onset of symptoms and to detect the infection for people to monitor. Tests can be done in central laboratories (CLT) or through point-of-care testing (PoCT).
Automatic systems with high flow potential in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
A single sample of peripheral blood is commonly used for CLT, although a series of samples can be used to look at the immune response.
A single sample of blood for PoCT is usually obtained from the skin puncture.
The first withdrawal step is not required for testing other than PCR methods. On 26 March 2020, the FDA designated 29 units that provided information to the agency when required and thus are now able to distribute their immunization tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under the Emergency Use Authority. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmune Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received Europe approval for its testing kits that could detect IgG and IgA antibodies to the virus in blood samples.
It has the ability to test hundreds of samples within a few hours and is therefore much faster than the traditional PCR test of viral RNA.
Immunizations can usually be detected 14 days after the onset of the infection. In early April, the UK found that none of the immune check kits they purchased was not good enough for use.
Hong Kong planned in which suspected patients can stay at home, "the emergency department will provide the sample tube to the patient", they will spit into it and will get the result of the investigation in no time. British NHS announced that they are launching a plan to investigate suspected cases at home in COVID-19, taking into account the health of the patient - the patient's risk of infecting others if he goes to the hospital or used an ambulance.
Drive-through testing centers have helped South Korea conduct the fastest, most comprehensive checks from any country. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that they had the ability to do about 12,000 tests per day in an ambulance setting and 10,700 tests in the past week.
When the order of checks is given by the doctor, the cost is borne by health insurance.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
By March 19, the drive-through checks were offered in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests conducted in Germany was not known, as only positive results were reported.
The first laboratory survey saw that by week 12/2020, a total of 483,295 samples were tested, including week 12/2020, and a total of 33,491 (6.9%) samples were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the samples of the samples of the "Turkey-CoV-2" samples, which were tested in the month of February 2020.
With the supervision of the construction by BGI founder Wang Jian and taking 5 days, the model has seen that if it was not introduced the ability to check, the number of cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the corresponding cost of dealing with the quarantine would have doubled.
Wuhan Laboratory's Huo-Yen labs have been promptly followed by Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
As of March 4, 2020, the total daily flow capacity was 50,000 tests per day. Multiplexed open source frameworks have been released by Origami Essay which can check up to samples of as many as 1122 COVID-19 patients using 93 tests. These balanced frameworks can be run in small laboratories without the need for robotic liquid handlers.
Prior to March, reagents' deficiencies and inadequate quantities caused problems in large-scale checks in the EU, the UK and the US.
This prompted some authors to explore sampling protocols that included heating samples at 98 <0xC2><0xB0>C (208 <0xC2><0xB0>F) for 5 minutes to free up the RNA genome for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now testing at a higher level of population than any other country, raising the level of the virus to a higher level of population per capita.
This was due to a combination of drive-through testing ability and purchasing a population-scale mass-throughput laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their “Huo-Yan” emergency testing labs in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is able to conduct thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory in the world to operate on such a large scale outside of China.
Various testing methods targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted and sent Germany's method of producing kits to develop low-income countries with a lack of resources themselves.
Germany’s method was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the Centers for Disease Control of the United States was not available until 28 January, delaying the availability of checks in the U.S. At the beginning of the outbreak, there were problems on the reliability of the check kit between China and the United States and these were inadequate in supplying enough kits to meet the demands and recommendations of the investigation by the country and Australia health experts.
On the contrary, experts point out that the widespread availability of testing in South Korea helped reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The testing capacity, especially in private sector laboratories, was developed over the years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization said that increasing testing programs is the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus led to a pile of thousands of pending tests in private U.S. laboratories and the supply of shovels and chemical reagents became strained.
In March 2020, China reported accuracy problems in its testing kits.
In the United States, the check kits developed by the CDC were “low”; the government then removed bureaucratic barriers that were preventing private checks. Spain bought check kits from Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioengineering Biotechnology Co. Ltd., but found that the results were not accurate.
The firm said the wrong results could be due to the failure to collect samples or use the kits correctly.
Spain’s ministry said it would remove the inaccurate test kits and replace them with a second test kit offered by Shenzhen BioG. 80% of the test kits purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave wrong results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China, which were not found to be accurate.
Prime Minister Matovi<0xC4><0x8D> suggested that they should be put in the dennube. Ate<0xC5><0x9F> Kara of Turkey’s Ministry of Health said that the check kits purchased by Turkey from China had a “high error rate” and that they “didn’t use them.” The UK which purchased 3.5 million test kits from China in early April 2020, announced that they were not usable.
After testing, the people who tested positive were quarantined and those who came in contact with the positive SARS-CoV-2 tested positive.
Instead of the first COVID-19 death in Italy, researchers working in the town of V<0xC3><0xB2> in Italy examined the entire population of about 3,400 people twice over a ten-day interval.
About half of the people with positive results had no symptoms, and those with all discovered cases were quarantined.
The travel ban at the incoming place completely eliminated the new infections.
The 2020 coronavirus pandemic has grown significantly slower than other developed countries in Singapore without aggressively detecting contact, checking, and quarantine, but without imposing extreme restrictions such as forcefully closing restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events have been canceled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay at home from March 28, but the school reopened on March 23 after a holiday.
Many other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also aggressively managed the pandemic by contact tracing, checking, and quarantine, but by less aggressive lockdowns.
Statistical studies have shown that the case fatality rate is much lower in countries that have had more tests than the number of deaths, possibly because these countries are more able to detect people with mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have the ability to test and have limited experience in national laboratories on COVID-19 send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the WHO's 16 reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference labs, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the chart below, the "% of positives in tests" column is influenced by the country's check policy.
Among other things, in a country where only hospitalised people are screened, the percentage of positive tests will be higher than in a country where all citizens are screened, regardless of whether they show symptoms or not.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of washing your hands with the purpose of removing kerosene, oil, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Regular handwashing with soap at any “necessary moments” during a day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhea and haze, which are transmitted through the faecal-directed route.
People may also be infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or common colds, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
Five important moments during the day where it is important to wash hands with soap are: before and after defecation, after cleaning the baby’s buttocks or changing the lung, before feeding the baby, before eating and preparing food or consuming raw meat, fish or poultry before and after.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands at the following times:
Before, during and after preparing food.
Before and after taking care of the sick person.
After cleaning the child who is changing the diaper or using the toilet.
After sneezing, sneezing or sneezing your nose.
After touching animal, animal feed, or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before providing medication or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main therapeutic purpose of hand washing is to clean the pathogens (bacterium, virus, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or diseases by hand.
This is especially important for those who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important action for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including: reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; prevention of infectious causes of diarrhea; reduction of respiratory infections;
And to reduce the infant mortality rate in cases of delivery at home.
A 2013 study showed that well-hand washing exercises in children under five may slightly improve their length.
In developing countries, simple behavioral changes, such as starting hand washing with soap, can reduce infant mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrheal diseases.
This simple act can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by about 50%.
Hand washing measures can reduce diarrhea cases by about a third, and this is similar to providing clean water in low-income areas.
A reduction of 48% in diarrhea cases can be associated with hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infection (ARI) as a self-motivated behavior in homes, schools, and communities worldwide.
A major ARI, pneumonia is the leading cause of death in children under the age of five, with an estimated 18 million children dying each year.
About 35 lakh children die every year due to diarrhea and pneumonia.
According to UNICEF, making a strong habit of washing hands with soap before eating and after using the toilet can save more lives than any single vaccine or therapeutic measure, which can reduce the number of deaths from diarrhea by about half and the number of deaths from acute respiratory infections by one-fourth.
Hand washing is usually integrated with other cleaning system measures as part of water, sanitation and sanitation (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo which is spread through direct physical contact.
A small harmful effect of hand washing is that repeated hand washing can cause damage to the skin due to drying of the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can cause itchy, flaky skin conditions known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among health workers.
Hand washing too often is also seen as a symptom of psychosis-obsessed disorder (OCD).
There are five important times during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce transmission from the fecal-directed route of the disease: after using the toilet ( urine immersion, stool-removal), after cleaning the baby’s buttocks (after changing the lump), before feeding the child, before eating and preparing food or from raw meat, fish, or poultry consumption.
Other occasions when proper hand washing techniques should be practiced to prevent transmission of the disease are: before and after the treatment of a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing or spraying your nose; after touching the animal waste or handling the animals; and after touching the waste.
In many countries, the rate of hand washing with soap is low.
A 2015 study of hand washing in 54 countries found that on average 38.7% of households adopted the practice of hand washing with soap. A 2014 study showed that the development in Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97%; this rate of hand washing was moderate in the United States by a certain percentage of time; and this rate was the lowest in children’s handwashing practices now available in China with 23 percent. Many hand washing behaviors with soap at critical times.
The "essential health care program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of mass action to promote children's health and education.
The core of this national programme includes cleaning teeth daily from fluoride as well as washing hands daily with soap, taking anti-wrinkle treatment twice a year.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
It is better to remove microorganisms from the skin by mixing soap or detergent in water.
The main action of soap and detergent is to reduce the obstacles in the solution, and increase the solubility.
Water alone is an inefficient skin purifier because fat and protein, which are organic soil components, do not dissolve easily in water.
However, sufficient flow of water in the cleaning is obtained.
Because of repeated use, solid soaps can contain bacteria left over from previous uses.
Some studies looking at the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soaps have concluded that the transfer is unlikely due to the bacteria being washed with foam.
However, according to the CDC, "Soaps with liquid soap drops on palms without touching hands are better".
The emphasis on antibacterial soaps has been promoted for the health conscious public.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants produces antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, with a comprehensive list of resistant breeds of organisms.
Therefore, even if antibiotic resistant breeds are not produced by antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are propagated to be effective.
In addition to humidifiers and skin-protecting agents, the refined formulations contain effective biopsy of acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as the pH regulator, microorganisms containing antimicrobially active benzoic acid and other skin adapters (Aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts) can be analysed. The University of Oregon Public School of
Comfortable warm water for hand washing is not warm enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow very fast at body temperature (37<0xC2><0xB0>C).
However, hot, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water to remove soil and bacterial-containing natural oils.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing the amount of microorganisms on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand disinfectant is a hand sanitizing agent with a water-free base.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, the heavily taxed alcohol water-free hand hygiene agent (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, disinfectant hand rubs or hand sanitizers) had begun to gain popularity.
Most of these isopropyl alcohols are based on alcohol or ethanol, which are synthesized with glycerin in a gel such as carbumer (polymer of acrylic acid), or a humidifier such as a liquid or foam, for ease of use and to reduce the effect of drying of alcohol.
Combining tanu hydrogen-peroxide further increases antimicrobial activism. Hand sanitizers with 60 to 95% alcohols are efficient disinfectants.
Alcohol rubber sanitizers destroy bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol rubber sanitizers that contain 70% alcohol destroy 99.97% of bacteria after 30 seconds of applying (3.5 log reduction, similar to 35 decibels reduction) and 1 minute after applying 99.99% to 99.999% of bacteria are destroyed. Hand sanitizers are the most effective (less than 4 to 5 log reductions) per bacteria. Some are the most effective.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective towards the norovirus (or norwalk) type of virus that is the most common cause of infectious gastrointestinal sore throats. Enough hand disinfectants or alcohol rubber should be used to completely wet or cover both hands.
The front and back part of both hands and the pores of all fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds, until the liquid, foam or gel is dried.
Finger pores should also be thoroughly washed by rubbing both palms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing instead of hand sanitizer rubbers, especially when the hands appear dirty.
The increased use of these agents is based on their ease of use and quick destructive activism towards microorganisms; however, they should not be used as a replacement for proper hand washing unless soap and water are unavailable.
Repeated use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless lubricants and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
Glycerin and/or other lubricants combined into the formula can reduce or eliminate the effect of drying alcohol.
In clinical trials, skin irritation and dryness were significantly reduced compared to soaps or antimicrobials from lubricated alcohol-based hand sanitizers.
Rarely allergic to additives present in alcohol or alcohol hand rubs are contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity.
The low tendency to induce irritating contact dermatitis compared to washing hands with soap and water became an attraction.
Despite their effectiveness, unwatered agents do not clean organic substances by hand, but simply disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of pathogens, as pathogens still remain on hand.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is heavily dependent on materials and formulations, and historically their performance has been significantly lower than alcohol and alcohol rubbers.
Recently, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to reduce efficacy after repeated use due to potentially progressive adverse skin reactions, has been shown to have sustained and cumulative antimicrobial activation after applying formulations that use benzalconium chloride.
Many people in low-income communities cannot buy soap and use ash or soil instead.
Ash or clay may be more effective than water alone, but may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms it can increase the spread of the disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent because in contact with water it forms an alkaline solution.
The WHO has recommended ash or sand as an alternative to soap, if soap is not available.
The correct handwashing technique recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the prevention of transmission of the disease includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Flowing water is recommended because the basins with stable water can be contaminated, although the temperature of the water does not matter.
Make the appropriate amount of soap on the hands, including the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap instead of water alone.
Rinse for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing causes friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and more germs are removed by rubbing for a longer period of time.
Wash well under running water.
Washing the hands in the basin can contaminate the hands again.
Allow to dry with a clean towel or dry in the air.
Wet and damp hands are more easily re-contaminated. The most missed areas are under the thumb, wrist, area between the fingers and the nails.
Artificial nails and chippy nail polish can shelter microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended to protect the hands from drying; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of transmission of infection.
In developing countries where tap water and/or soap are not available, various low-cost options can be created to facilitate hand washing, for example by pouring water from a hanging martaban or clover with suitable pores and/or ash. There are limited water supply (such as in developing countries) in conditions of low water supply (such as schools or rural areas).
Tippi-tap is a simple technique in which a lever, operated by a rope, is used to pour a small amount of water on the hands and the soap ticks.
Effectively drying hands is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some controversy over the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
Research conducted in large quantities suggests that paper towels provide more cleanliness than electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, sponsored by the paper towel industry The European Tissue Symposium, aimed at comparing the level of hygiene provided by paper towels, hot-air hand dryers and state-of-the-art jet-air hand dryers.
The total number of bacteria after hand washing and drying from hot air dryers increased by 194% on average fingernails and 254% on palms.
Drying with a jet-air dryer increased the total number of bacteria on average by 42% on the fingers and 15% on the palms.
After hand washing and drying from paper towels, the total number of bacteria decreased by 76% on average on the mattresses of the fingers and by up to 77% on the palms. Scientists also tested to establish whether each type of drying method resulted in the ability to cross-contamination of other toilet users and the toilet environment.
The jet-air dryer, which emits air from the unit at an estimated speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to blow microorganisms from the hands and the unit and possibly contaminate other toilet users and toilet environments up to 2 meters away.
The use of a hot-air hand dryer spread microbes from the dryer to 0.25 meters.
Paper towels showed no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by T<0xC3><0x9C>V Produkt und Umwelt, various hand drying methods were evaluated.
The following changes were observed in the calculation of bacteria after drying hands:
Many different hand dryer manufacturers exist, and hand dryers have been compared with drying paper towels.
Washing hands using hand bleaching wipes is an option in the absence of soap and water during travel.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Long after the discovery of its effectiveness in disease prevention in the hospital environment by Hungarian physician Ignaz Semelweis (in 1846), it became mandatory to wash the medical hand.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff about washing their hands when they forget.
In one study, their use has shown a reduction in infection rates.
The hands are medically washed for a minimum of 15 seconds, using soap and water or a proper amount of gel to make the foam and rub each part of the hands.
The fingers of both hands should be rubbed together.
If there are debris under the nails, a hard-haired brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can remain in the water on hands, it is important to wash well and dry thoroughly with a clean towel.
After drying, paper towels should be used to close the water (and any exit doors should be opened if necessary).
This prevents the re-contamination of the hands from these surfaces.
Hand washing in the health care system is aimed at eliminating pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and preventing them from being transmitted.
According to a report in The New England Journal of Medicine, hand washing remains at unacceptable levels in most medical environments, with a large number of physicians and nurses forgetting to wash their hands regularly before touching patients, leading to the transmission of microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures could reduce the rate of blood flow infection related to catheter by up to 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a leaflet demonstrating standard hand-washing and hand-washing in health-care areas.
The document guidance on hand hygiene available by this organization can also be found on its website for public comments.
A relevant review was made by Whitby and others.
Commercial equipment can measure and certify hand hygiene if performance of regulatory compliance is necessary.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has set out "five opportunities" for hand washing:
After coming into contact with blood/body fluid
Before the germ-destructive function, and
After patient care. Combining disinfectant chemicals in soaps ("Medical" or "Antimicrobial" soaps) provides the ability to kill the hand washing agent.
Such striking ability may be desired before surgery or in a system in which antibiotic resistant organisms are highly widespread. For surgical sneezing-swimming to ‘stretch’ your hands down, having a tap that is necessary for cleaning the nails, to be turned on and off without touching the hands and to dry the hands after washing, some chlorhexidine or iodine wash.
All the ornaments should be removed.
This procedure usually requires washing the wrists to the hands and elbows for 2-6 minutes.
There is no need to rub for a long time (10 minutes).
When washing, water on the wrists should be prevented from coming back to the hands.
After the hand wash is completed, the hands are dryed with a disinfected cloth and a surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash hands before and after the care of a sick person or use a hand disinfectant.
For control of Staphylococcus infection in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit from hand cleaning came from the first 20% of washing, and when the frequency of hand cleaning had increased by more than 35%, very little additional benefit was achieved.
Washing hands with plain soap, the rate of transmission of bacterial infectious disease is more than tripled compared to washing with antibacterial soap. Alcohol-based slurry leads to hand rubbing in more than 26 percent less than bacterium-based slurry. Handwashing with antibacterial soap goes more than hand-washing for a 30-minute interval with hand-washing soap. It was revealed that alcohol
But the H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium diffusion by hand are more effective than soap and water alcohol-based hand rubs to reduce spores. Measures to improve hand hygiene in health care systems include handwashing to employees, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand rubs, and hand sanitizers to employees.
More research is needed on which of these measures are most effective in various health care systems.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is considered an economical, necessary means to achieve good health, and even good nutrition.
However, achieving universal hand washing behavior is a challenge in people's homes, in schools and in the workplace due to a lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities.
For example, in most rural Africa, every private or public toilet has very few hand washing faucets, even though cheap options exist to make hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates may also be due to the habits put in place instead of being caused by soap or water shortages.
The encouragement and support of hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing and change the long-term behavior of the population.
In order for it to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation is necessary.
A systemic review of 70 studies found that community-based methods are effective at increasing hand washing in LMICs, while social promotional campaigns are less effective. An example for the promotion of hand washing in schools is the “three-star method” by the UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive steps to ensure that hand washings, as well as other hygiene requirements, from student soaps.
When the minimum standards are achieved, schools can go from one to three stars, respectively.
Making hand washing stations can be a part of hand washing campaigns that are done to reduce diseases and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness raising campaign that aims to try to bring about a change in behaviour. As a result of the coronavirus pandemic of 2019-20, UNICEF promoted the adoption of an emoji of handwashing.
Some studies have considered the overall cost effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries with regard to the prevention of DALYs.
However, a review shows that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation measures.
The importance of hand washing for human health - especially people with sensitive conditions, such as mothers who have given birth to a child or in wounded soldiers in hospitals - was first identified by two promoters of hand hygiene in the mid-19th century: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semelweiss who worked in Vienna, Austria and Florence Nightingale, English who is the "founder of modern nursing".
Most people at that time believed that the infection was caused by a smell called miasmus.
In the 1980s, food-borne outbreaks and health-related infections prompted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively increase hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 raised awareness of the importance of handwashing with soap to protect yourself from such infectious diseases in many countries.
For example, posters with "right hand washing techniques" were hung near hand washing sinks in public toilets and office buildings and airport toilets in Germany.
The phrase “washing your hands” from something means declaring your reluctance to take responsibility for that thing or to accept complicity in it.
It stems from the Matthew chapter of the Bible where Pontius Pilate separated himself from the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it became a phrase with very widespread use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clean up a hypothetical stain that shows her guilty conscience about the crimes committed by her and her husband's motivation to commit the crime.
It has also been found that people wash their hands more often than others, after they remember or contemplate unethical actions, and give more importance to hand washing equipment.
In addition, people who are allowed to wash their hands after such contemplation are less likely to engage in compensatory tasks such as volunteering.
Religions recommend hand washing for both sanitary and symbolic purposes. The symbolic hand washing with soapy water without washing hands are a part of the ritual hand washing described in many religions including Bah<0xC3><0xA1>’<0xC3><0xAD> religion, Hinduism, T<0xC3><0xA1>vila and Netilat Ayyyam in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wazu in Islam. Also provide advice for hand washing, especially after some works.
In Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash hands after using the toilet.
And, in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash hands before and after every meal.
Control of the risks of spreading COVID-19 infection at the workplace
Control of the risks of spreading COVID-19 infection at the workplace, for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), are applications of occupational safety and health practices for the control of hazards.
Proper control of the risk of disease spreading at the workplace depends on the work place and the work to be done, based on the risk assessment of sources of contact, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of individual personnel who are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low contact-risk tasks have minimal business contact with people and other co-workers, for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including: washing hands, encouraging personnel to stay home if they are sick, following respiratory etiquette, and regular cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Moderate contact-risk tasks are those that require frequent or close contact with people who do not know or are suspected to have COVID-19 infection, but who may have been infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes employees who have contact with the general public such as schools, high population-density work environments, and some high-volume sales arrangements.
In addition to basic infection prevention measures, the control measures of hazards for this group include: adhering to high-efficiency air filters, using sneez guards, and maintaining personal protective equipment available for that situation if a COVID-19 infected person is exposed to.
OSHA considers those health workers and mortuary-house personnel to be at high contact risk, exposed to a COVID-19 infected or suspected person, and this risk increases to a higher contact risk if employees perform procedures that produce aerosols on a COVID-19 infected or suspected person, or collect or handle samples from them.
Controls of hazards suitable for these personnel include negative pressure ventilation chambers such as engineering control and personal protective equipment suitable for work.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have many effects within the workplace.
Employees may be absent from work for fear of being sick, needing to care for others, or possible contact.
What goods are demanded, and the means of obtaining these goods (such as at low demand times or shopping through delivery or moving services), can change the nature of the business in relation to both.
Finally, the movement of goods from geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be affected. Preparation and response plan for an infectious disease can be used to direct protective functions.
Plans address levels of risk associated with various workplaces and job functions, including risk factors arising from sources of risk, home and community arrangements, and risk factors for individual personnel such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also outline the controls necessary to address the risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of an outbreak.
Preparedness and response plans for infectious disease may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
Targets for response to an outbreak include: reducing transmission among employees, protecting people at high risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other units in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease in a community with a place of business affects the responses to be adopted.
The sequence of hazard controls is a structure that is widely used to form a group of hazard controls according to the effectiveness in occupational safety and health.
Where COVID-19 threats cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering control, followed by administrative control, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls include separating employees from work-related hazards without relying on employee behavior, and may be the most economical solution in implementing it.
Administrative controls are changes to the work policy or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent some contacts.
All kinds of PPE to be selected on the basis of danger to personnel, to be properly fitted (e.g., respirators), to be worn continuously and properly, to be inspected regularly, to be maintained and changed as required, and to be properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low contact risk tasks have minimal business contact with people and other co-workers.
The basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include: frequent and well-hand washing, encouraging personnel to stay at home if they are sick, providing respiratory etiquettes covering cough and sneezing. Regularizing the use of tools, tissues and waste, and preparing remote or transition shift shift shift shifts, preparing the equipment to others, if necessary.
Early identification and segregation of potential infectious individuals at the workplace is an important step in protecting personnel, customers, visitors and others.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute carcinogen disease stay at home until they are free of fever, fever signs, or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without fever-reducing or other symptom-modifying drugs.
According to OSHA, moderate contact-risk tasks include tasks that require frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 meters) with people who are not known or suspected to be infected with COVID-19, but may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community transmission around a business location, or because the person has recently traveled to an international location with extensive COVID-19 transmission.
These include personnel who have contact with the general public by performing procedures such as schooling, staffing procedures on high population-density work environments, and staffing procedures on the operating conditions of the workplaces, staffing procedures on the procedures of the procedures of the procedures and procedures of the procedures of the procedures, including the installation of high-efficiency air filters in the management of these and the high-risk groups, setting up of physical barriers, and the drive-through windows for customer service.
Workers in this risk group rarely need the use of respirators.
If a person gets sick on an airplane, appropriate controls for the safety of personnel and other passengers include: removing the sick person up to 6 feet away from others, naming a crew member to serve the sick person and giving the sick person a face mask or asking the sick person to cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.
The crew should wear usable medical gloves when caring for the sick passenger or touching the body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and should potentially wear additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other usable items should be disposed of in a biohazard bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected later on. For commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, the hazards are to postpone travel when sick under the control and self-isolation and notify the medical center immediately on board the ship if other symptoms develop while boarding the ship or if the person is sick.
Ideally, medical follow-up should be carried out in the room of the isolated person. For schools and child care facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closure for cleaning or disinfecting if an infected person has been living in a school building absolute of community transmission.
When there is minimal to medium community transmission, social distancing strategies can be applied, such as field visits, gatherings and other large gatherings such as cancelling meals in physical education or singing classes or restaurants, increasing the distance between desks, shifting arrival and vacation times, limiting unnecessary visitors, and separating the office space for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is enough transmission in the local community, extended school holidays can be considered in addition to social distancing strategies. For law enforcement personnel who carry out daily law activities, the immediate health risk is considered by the CDC as follows.
Law enforcement officers who have to contact confirmed or suspected persons of COVID-19 are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If there is close contact during the capture, personnel should clean and disinfect their duty belt and equipment before reusing, using household cleaning sprays or wipes, and follow standard operating procedures for the prevention and disposal of used PPE and for the prevention and disposal of clothing.
OSHA considers some health care and mortuary personnel to be in high or very high categories of contact risk.
High contact-risk tasks include providing health care, assisting, laboratory and medical transport personnel who come into contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
These become very high contact risk if employees perform procedures that produce aerosols on known or suspected COVID-19 patients, collecting or handling samples from them.
Processes that produce aerosols include duct penetration, cuff induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or collecting samples from rip-offs.
High contact risk morgue-house tasks include people who prepare the body of individuals with known or suspected cases of COVID-19 at the time of their death; these become very high contact risk if they conduct autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups, including during the course of performing procedures that produce aerosols, include separation chambers for known or suspected patients.
Specific negative pressure aeration may be appropriate in some health care and mortuary-home arrangements.
The samples should be handled with biosafety level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients, depending on whether they are a suspected COVID-19 case, be isolated in different waiting areas. In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends respirators for individuals who work within 6 feet of known or suspected patients who are infected with SARS-CoV-2, and those who produce aerosols.
In the U.S., N95 filtering facepieces approved by NIOSH or better should be used in terms of a comprehensive, written respiratory safety program that includes fit-testing, training, and medical examination.
Other types of respirators can provide more protection and improve employee comfort. WHO does not recommend coveralls, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than being transmitted through bodily fluids.
WHO recommends only one surgical mask for screening personnel at the entry point.
For those who are caring for or transporting respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients without any aerosol-producing procedures, the WHO recommends a surgical mask, goggles facial shield, chong and gloves.
If an aerosol-producing procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given that the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, only allowing people involved in direct care to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, only needing to use the PPE required for specific work, using the same respirator without removing multiple patients with the same diagnosis, inspecting and coordinating the PPE supply chain.

Remittance Date/Time: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC
Licensing: CC0: No rights reserved
This month we have extraordinary circumstances around us.
The COVID-19 pandemic has made clear to all human beings around the world the responsibilities we have towards each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented for us, but we do know that our best response depends on global empathy, mutual cooperation, and community enhancement, which is at the heart of this organization.
The kind of camaraderie we’ve seen between all our colleagues on email, calls and chats proves exceptionally well how many extraordinary human beings we’ve had the privilege of working with.
I am so grateful and proud to have you all as co-workers that I cannot express in words.
Last week, a man shared his appreciation of our work with me.
He reminded me of how meaningful it is to turn the world towards Wikipedia at this time, and how powerful it is to remain available online and for all of this very important resource.
Your work makes it possible, whether you keep the sites running or the source of our co-workers’ salaries or keep our communities safe.
The world needs information from Wikipedia, and now it needs it the most.
This is a moment in which our work, and our way of doing it, will both have a meaningful impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission, and your role in it, we are going to make some significant changes in the way we work with you this coming week.
Changes in our work and time-savings
As Robin pointed out earlier, the C-Team met last night to discuss our methodology and prepare a schedule for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we considered the appropriate response to the situation before us, and the best way to sustain the organization during this time.
We were overwhelmed and we wanted to relieve the tension and support our mission for a long time.
If you have to reduce your work, there is nothing wrong with that.
For all staff, contractors, and contract personnel:
Our daily work expectations will be around 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week until the next notification.
We're not declaring a holiday - if you're able to work more than normal hours, the mission needs your help.
However, the world is unpredictable at this time, and whether you need to take care of your loved ones, bring groceries, or go to a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We are not counting your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
We don’t have to say it, but we are saying it.
No sick leave or PTO is required - just tell your manager and help your team revise the calendar and schedule to ensure that no one sees the main areas of work.
(If you have been confirmed to have COVID-19, please inform Brian of T&C Ops so that T&Amp;C can help you and ensure that appropriate attention is paid to your situation on behalf of the management.)
Full pay will be given to hourly employees.
We have already said that, and we are once again reaffirming our commitment to fulfilling our promises to our contractors and hourly staff colleagues.
Everyone will be paid based on his normal working hours during normal circumstances.
Even if you are sick and cannot work, you will get paid.
If you want to work, we are with you.
Many people use their work as a way to get rid of the stress associated with the world around them.
What we can do can be extremely satisfying, especially at such a time.
Once again, taking care of yourself is the most important thing.
We ask that you speak to your manager, so that we know what to expect, and then we can change accordingly.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are some things we can’t stop.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust and Security, and Grant Assembling Teams (and others) perform such over-the-top tasks that may require additional collaboration.
We will initiate a process with all departments, to assess the existing objectives and to focus our attention on supporting essential things for our mission
We all have a lot to do, we’ll all just focus on the most essential projects.
By reducing the speed now, we will avoid injury later.
There is no plan to "double our time for reimbursement" after the global pandemic has passed.
You will no longer be required to work extra hours to meet the deadlines beyond reality.
We believe that circumstances have changed, and we will work towards setting new goals and deadlines where appropriate.
What will happen to the annual plan (APP)?
In order to adjust to our new reality and daily working hours expectations, we want to revise the timeline to meet our 2020-2021 annual plan.
We intend to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that gives us more time to budget, so that employees can prioritize their over-important work, self-care, and care for loved ones, and accommodate those who need or want to work on a reduced timetable over the next few weeks.
This extension of time frame will bring down our current planning workload and pressure across the organization.
We will place our proposal before the Board of Directors next week and as soon as we get confirmation, we will inform the representatives and teams about the further steps.
Thank you to the AP team for your leadership in this.
Office position, contact, and cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our SF-based colleagues has probably been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, with utmost care, we deployed antiviral cleaning personnel to disinfect all the surfaces of the San Francisco office.
She disinfected every surface, lobby, and elevator bank from the anti-viral solution of the hospital-grade to our floor.
The building is implementing its own care-duty protocol using products that support the safety of its residents.
We are confident that the office will be fully ready when we return.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork that has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all staff members based in DC.
Last week, our DC office had adopted a completely remote system in line with the guidance shared with San Francisco.
As some of our NYC-based colleagues know, there is also talk of leasing a location in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing but may be delayed.
Some of our co-workers are working from home/away for the first time.
Our co-workers who have been working from home for a long time know that it will require adjustments, and they want to give you some advice:
Limit the time of meetings to a maximum of one or two hour increments.
If longer sessions are necessary, consider sharing them over several days.
Define meetings clearly, keep the agenda ready, and send reading materials in advance.
Make the video your default option with the help of tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate live collaboration and combination.
Take the initiative to facilitate every meeting, monitor a person chat for questions and keep track of the speaker list, and help one person take notes (or take notes with mutual support)
If you need a comfortable headset, send an email to Tech Support.
Make use of your health insurance to pay for health care.
Join the <0x23>remoties channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team is investigating the webinar-based workforce guidance to support the growth in distributed work across the entire foundation.
Last week, we asked all community grant recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as editathons, etc. until the WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We told them that we understand that our request for cancellation and other restrictions may make it impossible to complete their mutually agreed grant activities, and that no one will be penalized for being forced to delay or modify those goals.
This coming week we will follow up with additional guidance regarding Wikimania and other regional and related community conferences.
This constraint has caused a sense of sadness to the entire global community, but they also have a sense of relief from the clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, on Wikimedia and otherwise.
Moving forward, CRT is working to organize a page on Met-Wiki with an aim to monitor the impact and provide a place for the community to follow our communications with them.
Maintaining contact with COVID-19 related issues
We will send an invitation to your calendars next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will use this time to provide additional updates, answer your questions, and spend a little time connecting with each other.
We are together in these situations and are there to help as much as possible.
In the meantime, you can continue to find information from this email on Office Wiki, and all other necessary COVID-19 related information.
CRT will keep these pages up-to-date and keep all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with employees living in remarkably affected countries at this time.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a major worksheet, or coverage challenge, or you need help with anything else, please contact CRT and work with it.
We are here to provide assistance and help establish relationships as needed.
If your case is confidential or sensitive, please send an email to Brian Judden, Director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as abandonment of our functions and responsibilities.
Rather, they recognize that at this time, our actions and obligations are likely to need to be adapted in a way that we have never done in the past.
We believe that these steps are necessary to help each other, so that we can continue to act, provide our activities with the support they need, and continue to serve the service the world depends on.
When the time comes, our planned work will be waiting for us.
At the moment, it's time to help each other, and make space for important work to come in the coming weeks and possibly the coming months.
We need you all to make this possible, and so we want you all to take care of yourself and your families, so that you can be at your best when needed.
Now, please wash your hands and don’t touch your face!
Catherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doren D, Gregory V, Jamie V, Joel L, Linnet L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jamie V, Janey U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme associated with the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 balances the activation of the corresponding angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing the angiotensin (1-7), making it a promising drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 also acts as an entry point in cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metloenzyme located on the surface of the intestine and other cells.
The ACE2 protein consists of N-terminal peptides M2 domain and C-terminal receptor amino acid carrier domains.
ACE2 is a once-crossing type I membrane protein with unreleased enzymatically active domains on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The external cellular domain of ACE2 is decomposed from the permeable domain by another enzyme called sheds, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is mainly associated with lung type II atmospheric cells, small gut enterocytes, arterial and vein interlayer cells, and the cell membrane of the arterial soft muscle cells in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral vulkut, striatum, hypothalamus and brain column.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as the talent of ACE.
ACE disrupts the angiotensin I hormone in the vasculature angiotensin II.
ACE2 then disintegrates carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and renders it carrier-expansive angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Hol-Hol-Phe)
ACE2 [des-Arg9]- can also disintegrate several other peptides, including breducine, apeline, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and graylin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of indifferent amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and its role is reported in Hartnap disease.
As a parsley protein, ACE2 acts as the main entry point in cells for certain coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SARS-producing virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19-generating virus).
More specifically, joining the enzyme domain of ACE2 on the surface of cells of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the endocytosis and endomem located within the cells is a transfer of both viruses and enzymes.
This entry process also requires the inducing of S proteins by the nutrient serine protease TMPRSS2, which is under current investigation as a potential therapy. This has led some to hypothesize that lowering ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, many professional entities and regulatory bodies have recommended the continuation of standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that “the use of ACE inhibitors compared to controls was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia by 34%.”
At the same time, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors, who were at higher risk of pneumonia, especially in people with trauma and heart failure."
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a decrease in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less dominant than the overall risk of pneumonia.”
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered the new therapy for acute lung damage, and appeared to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with lipolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the beginning of the action is 30 minutes with a 24-hour impact process (period).
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for people with intolerance to excellent renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or diseases in which circulating angiotensin II increases. Acute respiratory distress is evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of the syndrome.
The COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications designed to help contact tracing in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e., the process of identifying individuals ("contacts") who may have been in contact with an infected person.
Several applications were developed or proposed with official government assistance in some areas and jurisdictional areas.
Several frameworks have been developed for the creation of contact tracing applications.
Privacy concerns have been raised, especially about systems that are based on tracking the geographical location of app users.
The less intrusive option involves the use of Bluetooth signals to log a user's proximity to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate functionality directly into their Android and iOS operating systems to support such Bluetooth-based apps.
In China, the Chinese government has employed an app in conjunction with Alipay, allowing citizens to check if they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It is being used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was developed by the local IT community, which was released as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based app “StopKorona!” to detect contact with potentially infected individuals and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval by the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government said the contact tracing app was in an advanced stage of development, and would be available for planning within weeks. A similar app ("StopCovid") has also been employed in Ireland and France.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore’s TraceTogether app and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia wants to introduce a geofencing app for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure they don’t get out of the house.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, listed a number of potential practical problems with app-based systems, including false positive cases and a potential lack of effectiveness if the app's use is limited to only a small fraction of the population.
Addressing concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple limited only to "official" or otherwise reputable organizations, determining what types of organizations can include coronavirus-related apps in its App Store.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy campaigners have expressed their concern about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, especially about whether the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be destroyed after the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement for the limitations on such surveillance.
The organizations have declared eight conditions on government projects:
The monitoring must be "legal, necessary and proportional";
There should be an exhaustive section for the expansion of supervision and supervision;
The use of data should be limited to COVID-19 purposes;
Data security and anonymity must be protected and represented protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should be avoided to promote discrimination and authoritarianism;
Any sharing of data with third parties must be defined in law;
measures to protect the rights of citizens to respond to abuse and to abuse;
“Relevant participation” will be required by all “relevant stakeholders”, including public health experts and authoritative groups. The German Caucasian Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter Onh Grengen) (RSF) have also issued checklists.
The purpose of the proposed Google/Apple plan, when not required, is to address the problem of constant monitoring by removing the tracing mechanism from their device operating system.
Some countries used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download apps and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to unrefined location data have significant potential privacy problems.
However, not all systems with central servers require access to personal location data; many privacy-protection systems have been created that only use central servers for interoperability (see section below).
A non-app-based system was used to conduct contact tracing in South Korea.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combined these to generate notifications through text messages to potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has made location information publicly available due to far-reaching changes in information privacy laws following the outbreak of MERS in that country.
This information is available to the public through many applications and websites. Many countries, including Germany, considered using centralized and privacy-protection systems.
As of April 6, 2020, these details had not yet been released.
Tracing privacy-protection contact with a large body of research literature from at least 2013 is a well-established concept. As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to log a user’s proximity to other cellphones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinating effort involving both centralized and decentralized methods, and it is not a single protocol. The decentralized protocol includes decentralized privacy-protection proximity tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, formerly contact event number for CEN), privacy sensitive contact protocols and mobile tracing.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never goes out of the device, and all are on the matching device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform to use privacy-protection technologies when collecting and using location or path-breaking data for tracking the spread of COVID-19.
This is based on the research of the white paper "Apps Gon Rogue: Maintenance Personal Privacy in the Epidemic" released in March 2020. A similar effort is SafeTrace by Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technology, which was originally established in the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies, allowing users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities without compromising the privacy of that data.
On April 5, 2020, the Global TCN Coalition was founded by groups that had essentially organized in terms of similar approaches and large-scale similar protocols aimed at reducing fragmentation, and enabling the global interoperability of tracing and warning apps, which was an important aspect of achieving comprehensive adaptation.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it has opened-sourced the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and companies controlling Apple, Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracing, which they claimed would protect privacy based on a combination of Bluetooth low-energy technology and privacy-protective cryptography.
He also published the specifications of the main techniques used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, this system is intended to be made available in three phases:
Providing tools to enable governments to create official privacy-protection coronavirus tracing apps
This functionality is directly integrated into iOS and Android.
Drug re-establishment (also known as drug re-purpose, re-profiling, re-appointment or remedial change), for which it was originally developed, is a re-purpose of an approved drug for the treatment of a different disease or medical condition.
It is a system of scientific research that is currently being adopted to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research instructions include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and plasma transfusion related to health benefits. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 target proteins, each of which has several ligand binding sites.
The analysis of those binding sites provides the proper project to develop an effective antiviral drug to protect against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphate.
Hussain and others studied a number of candidate compounds, which then adapted and analyzed for their latitude similarity with most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of an effective SARS-CoV-2-infected drug in a pre-clinical study to be recommended in a clinical study structure.
Chloroquine is an anti-malaria drug that is also used to protect against some self-immune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine, Solidarity will be among the four drugs to be studied as part of a clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine of the state of New York would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA’s process of clinical trials and is authorized only under the EUA as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients who are hospitalized but are not able to receive treatment in clinical trials.
The CDC has stated that "the use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" is not yet established.
Doctors have said they are using the drug when "there is no other option."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is doing a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Larger studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a test on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to show Favipiravir "clearly effective."
35 patients in Shenzhen tested negative on an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted on 240 patients with pneumonia in Wuhan, half of the patients received Favipiravir and half received Omifenovir.
The Italian pharmaceutical agency reminded the public that the current evidence in support of the drug is very low and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced it would buy the drug from Japan for its reserves, and the military would use it to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has sent a proposal to the Trump administration about buying the drug. This drug may be less effective in severe cases of the disease, where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for use by pregnant women or women trying to conceive.
A study of a combination of antiviral Lopinavir and Ritonavir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir (blacktra), concluded that "no benefit was observed".
The drugs were designed to prevent HIV from replicating by binding to the protease.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that will bind to the protease of SARS-CoV-2. There have been criticisms within the scientific community about directing resources for the re-purpose of drugs developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO has included Lopinavir/Ritonavir in the international Solidarity Test.
Remdesivir was developed and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that Remdesivir had artificial ambient antiviral activations to protect against several filo-, pneumo-, paramoxo- and corona-viruses.
A problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious disease and transmission.
Some preliminary pre-test studies suggest that Remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are ongoing, including two tests conducted by Cleveland University Hospital; one for people with moderate illness and the other for people with more severe illness.
There are three ongoing clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C for people hospitalized with COVID-19 and critically ill; two controlled placebos (in China, Canada) and one without any control (in Italy).
New York State began testing for antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM), for the treatment of patients with pre-existing conditions from showing symptoms of Novel Coronavirus, is planning a clinical trial for an endocrine corticosteroid for asthma, Tigens alvesco (Sixlesodine).
A Phase II trial of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is underway in Denmark, Germany, and Austria with 200 patients admitted from severe, hospitalised cases to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchisin in reducing inflammatory and pulmonary complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is recruiting 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and who are experiencing mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who are not using an effective contraceptive method are not eligible.
A number of anti-scratch tests are being conducted in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is being widely used to treat patients, due to which the Italian drug agency has published guidelines on its use.
A multi-disciplinary study on 300 patients researching the use of anoxoparain sodium at therapeutic and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, considerable scientific attention has been focused on the re-purpose of approved anti-viral drugs, which were developed for previous outbreaks such as MERS, SARS and West Nile viruses.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for COVID-19 treatment as per Chinese 7th edition guidelines
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for COVID-19 treatment as per Chinese 7th edition guidelines
Some antibiotics that have been identified as potentially reusable as COVID-19 treatments include:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved by China.
Testing also in Italy and China. And see Tocilizumab<0x23>COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine for protection from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although none of the vaccines have completed clinical trials, several efforts are being made to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was not expected to be available in less than 18 months of a vaccine to protect against SARS-CoV-2, the disease-causing virus.
Five vaccine candidates were in the first phase of security studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, leading to considerable investment and research activity to develop the vaccine.
Many organizations are using published genomes to develop potential vaccines for protection from SARS-CoV-2.
As reported in April, the essentials of the CEPI initiative for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale planning and global learning.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during the start of 2020 to create an effective vaccine for protection from COVID-19.
Advanced major platform goals in Phase I security studies include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I Developer and Vaccine Candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral Vector (Phase I Developer and Vaccine Candidate: CanSino Biologics, Adenovirus Type 5 Vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, 115 total vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, of which 78 have been confirmed as active projects (79 according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others are declared, but less public information is available (designed or envisaged in planning).
Initial safety and immunity tests are carried out in a phase I-II trial, it is usually performed at random, placebo-controlled and multiple sites while determining a more accurate, effective dose.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group monitoring adverse effects on optimal doses, and testing the effectiveness of the vaccine for disease prevention.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were still not in human evaluation (still in "precautionary" research).
Around 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine, which would genetically modify viral proteins to induce an immune response.
Around 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced the launch of work on a vaccine aimed at starting human trials in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
Around January 29, 2020, the Yansen Pharmaceutical Company, led by Haneke Schuttemaker, announced that it had begun work on developing a vaccine.
Yansen is developing an oral vaccine with its biotechnology partner Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced a manufacturing partnership to develop a vaccine with Vaxart.
On February 8, 2020, Oncogen, a laboratory in Romania, published a paper on the design of a vaccine similar to the technology used for cancer neoantigen immunization therapy.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that he had finalized the synthesis of the vaccine and was starting trials.
On 27 February 2020, a generics subsidiary, Nugenrex Immuno-Oncology, announced that they are launching a vaccine project to create a li-ki peptide vaccine to protect against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested in humans "within 90 days."
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On 5 March 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Material Command in Fort Detroit and Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, Western Maryland, both announced they were working on a vaccine.
Around 10 March 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it was in the development and manufacture of the vaccine.
Novavax will work closely with Inc.
The partners announced plans for a pre-clinical trial and a Phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, India's health ministry announced that they were working with 11 dissidents, and that it would take at least one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine even on an early track.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of a coronavirus-like particle under partial funding from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is in laboratory research, which is planned for human trials for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered Curvaceux "a large sum of money for special learning of the COVID-19 vaccine" against which the German government opposed.
On 17 March 2020, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to develop a mRNA-based vaccine.
The mRNA-based vaccine candidate, BNT162, is currently in pre-clinical testing, whose clinical trials are expected to begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, an Italian biotechnology company, Takis Biotech announced that they would have prenatal test results in April 2020 and that their final vaccine candidate could start testing until fall.
On 19 March 2020 in France, The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced to invest US$4.9 million in the COVID-19 vaccine research association, which includes Institute Pasteur, Themis Biosciences (Viana, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, which makes a total investment of US$29 million in COVID-19 vaccine development.
CEPI's other investment partners for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curovac, Innova, Novavax, University of Hong Kong, University of Oxford and University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists have started animal testing of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-improved RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced C$275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical measures to protect against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates from Canadian companies and universities, such as the University of Saskatchewan.
Around the same time, the Canadian government announced a national "vaccine bank" of several new vaccines that could be used when there were other coronavirus outbreaks, with plans to set up a C$192 million specifically to develop a COVID-19 vaccine.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on the testing of PittCoVacc, a potential COVID-19 vaccine in mice, stating that "MNA-provided SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines had spurred antigen-specific antibody responses [in mice], which would begin to appear 2 weeks after vaccination."
On April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy in Canada announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to replicate inside human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies to protect against SARS-CoV-2 viruses.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three universities, in conjunction with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, accumulated resources for learning from IBM to supercomputers.
Some vaccines have asymptomatic effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have additional benefits from the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia is asking 4,170 health workers to be recruited.
It is possible that vaccines will not be safe or effective in development.
Initial research assessing vaccine efficacy using COVID-19-specific animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, indicate the need for bio-safety level 3 containment measures to combat the living virus and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines have been tested for protection from SARS and MERS in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no treatment or protective vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no certified vaccine for protection from MERS.
When MERS became widespread, it was assumed that existing SARS research could provide a useful blueprint for developing vaccines and treatments for protection from MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was a (DNA-based) MERS vaccine that completed phase I clinical trials in humans, and three others are in progress, all of which are viral-vectored vaccines, two are adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one is MVA-V.
Social media posts have fueled a conspiracy, claiming that the virus responsible for COVID-19 was aware of and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents cited by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus such as SARS.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to the virus to the onset of symptoms is usually around five days, but it can also range from two to fourteen days.
Although symptoms are mild in most cases, in some cases viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure develop.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus mainly spreads among people during close contact, often through small drops caused by coughing, sneezing, or talking.
Although these droplets arise when exhaling, they generally fall on the ground or on surfaces rather than being infectious over long distances.
People can also be infected by touching a dirty surface and later touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
This is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although transmission may be possible before the symptoms appear and in the later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal fah.
It is recommended to use masks for those who suspect they are infected with the virus and also for their caregivers.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the general public vary, some authorities recommend not to use them, some recommend their use, and others make their use necessary.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in all six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus can be symptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and breathlessness.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty in breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty waking up, and blueness of the face or lips; it is advisable to seek immediate medical care when these symptoms are present.
Less commonly, symptoms of the upper respiratory tract such as sneezing, sneezing, or sore throat can be seen.
Symptoms of gastroenteritis such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed in different percentages.
In some cases in China, initially only chest tightness and sharp heartbeat were seen.
In some cases, the disease can extend to pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and death.
This is called the period of incubation.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but it can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of individuals who develop symptoms develop symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. The notifications show that symptoms do not develop in all concomitant individuals.
The role of these asynchronous carriers in transmission is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not show symptoms is currently unknown and are being studied, which the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) has reported that 20% of all confirmed cases were asymptomatic during their stay in the hospital.
China’s National Health Commission began incorporating symptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1; 130 (78%) of the 166 infections that day were symptomatic at the time of testing.
Both mucus and saliva can contain large amounts of viral.
Talking in a loud voice produces more drops than talking in a normal voice.
A study in Singapore found that drops that go up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) without a covered cough could arise.
Although the virus is not airborne in general, the National Academy of Sciences has reported that bioaerosol transmission may be possible and samples from air collectors in corridors outside people's rooms came positive for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as duct entry and heart pulmonary therapy (CPR) can cause respiratory secretions to become aerosols and thus cause airborne transmission.
Although there are concerns that it can spread through feces, this risk is considered low. This virus is most contagious when people are symptomatic; although the spread is possible before symptoms emerge, its risk is low.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person usually infects two to three other individuals. The virus survives on surfaces for hours to days.
In particular, the virus was found detectable for up to three days on cardboard, plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
Even then, it varies depending on humidity and temperature.
If used correctly, soaps and detergents are also effective; soap products deactivate them by dissolving the fatty protective layer of viruses, as well as freeing them from skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a study of Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral volume, and the sixth patient showed the highest amount of viral on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with the group of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
All the features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the respective coronaviruses in nature.
Outside of the human body, the virus is destroyed with household soap, which breaks its protective cover. SARS-CoV-2 is related to the closeness to the original SARS-CoV.
Lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because viruses reach the nutrient cells through enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the most abundant of lung type II aerodynamic cells.
The virus uses a special superficial glycoprotein called "peplomer" to connect to ACE2 and enter the nutrient cell.
Acute heart damage was found in 12% of infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China and is more common in severe disease.
Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high due to somatic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the progression of the disease, but acute myocardial damage may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly manifested in the heart and are involved in the function of the heart.
Patients with COVID-19 infections have been found to have a high prevalence of thromboembolism (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%), which may be related to poor disease diagnosis. The autopsy of people who died from COVID-19 have been found to have diuretic airborne damage (DAD) and lymphocyte-containing external substances within the lungs.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has a follow-up to the ACE2-stimulating epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of somatic hyperplasia.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-residue T-cells were shown to be correlated with the selection of inflammatory IL-6-residue monoocytes in COVID-19 patients and severe lung disease.
Lymphocytic external substances have also been reported in the autopsy.
WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard method of testing is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharynx; however, a nasal swab or mucus sample may also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but these require two blood samples to be taken over a two-week interval and the immediate value of the results is reduced.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and publish the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which can detect the active infection and whether a person was previously infected) were in development, but have not yet been widely used.
Chinese experience with the test has shown that purity is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the U.S. approved the first care-in-place test on March 21, 2020 for use at the end of that month. The clinical guidelines issued by the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University showed ways to detect the infection based on clinical facilities and epidemiological risk.
Bi-polar ground-glass ambiguities are common with a peripheral, asymmetric and rear distribution in the initial infection.
Subpleural dominence, crazie pawing (thickness of the walls that are palpable with variable atmospheric fillers), and densification may appear when the disease progresses.
Fewer statistics about the microscopic lesions and disease body function of COVID-19 are available.
The main pathological findings obtained from the autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pulmonary spasms, pericarditis, condensation of the lungs and pulmonary suffocation
Four types of viral pneumonia can be seen:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary rashes, pneumocytosis overgrowth, large immature pneumocytes, intracellular inflammation with lymphocytic intravenous incontinence and multi-centerial giant cell formation
Severe Pneumonia: Dehydrated Atmospheric Damage (DAD) with Dehydrated Atmospheric Leakage.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe short-oxygenemia.
Treating Pneumonia: Management of leakages and pulmonary intracranial fibrillation in the atmospheric cavity
Blood: Transmitted Interval Scandinavia (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently and with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, maintaining good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommend using the inside of the elbow if the tissue is not available.
Proper hand hygiene is encouraged after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC has recommended the use of cloth face coverings in public settings to limit transmission by partially symptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce exposure to infected individuals with large groups, by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and canceling large public gatherings.
The guidelines also include keeping people at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away.
There is no drug known to be effective in preventing COVID-19. Since the vaccine is not expected until at least 2021, an important part of the management of COVID-19 is to try to reduce the peak of the pandemic, which is called "reduce the curve."
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands appear dirty, before eating and after spraying, coughing or sneezing their noses.
Additionally, it recommends using alcohol-based hand bleachers with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available. Areas where professional hand bleachers are not readily available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, the antimicrobial action arises from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is "not an active substance for hand sepsis".
Glycerol is mixed as a humidifier.
People are managed with supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and providing support to other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people who are suspected of being infected with the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve immunity.
Assistive treatments may be useful in people with mild symptoms in the early stages of the infection. The WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for taking care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intecivists and pulmonologists in the US have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies into a free source, IBCC.
As of April 2020, no specific treatment for COVID-19 is available.
For symptoms, some medical personnel recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for primary use.
Precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health care systems, when procedures that produce aerosols such as duct penetration or hand sanitization are performed.
For healthcare workers caring for individuals infected with COVID-19, the CDC recommends keeping the person in an Airborne Infection Separation Room (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and airborne precautions. The CDC outlines guidelines for use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Recommended equipment is: PPE, respirator or face mask, eye protection equipment, and medical gloves. When available, respirators (instead of face masks) are preferred.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial systems, but the FDA has authorized masks for use under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against dust-like airborne particles, but the effectiveness of a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for non-approved experiments.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so severe that they require mechanical ventilation or other options, but in a few percent of cases they are required.
The type of respiratory aid for individuals with COVID-19 related respiratory failure is being actively studied for those hospitalized, with some evidence that high-flow nasal entrainment or duct penetration with a two-tier positive airway pressure can be avoided.
Whether one of these two offers similar benefits to critically ill people is not known.
Some physicians prefer to use intravenous mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high-flow nasal entrails. Severe cases are most common in older adults (those over 60 years of age and especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, which limits a health system's ability to handle a sudden increase in the number of severe COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical support for parenthood, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are eventually admitted to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as COVID-19 develops acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and it becomes increasingly difficult to provide oxygen.
Ventilators require pressure control systems and ventilators capable of high PEEP to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of lung damage and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilators.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020, and many antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may develop by 2021, many of the drugs that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in progressive testing.
Antiviral medication may be attempted in people with severe disease.
WHO recommends volunteers to participate in trials of the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has temporarily allowed health-enhancing plasma as a experimental treatment in cases where the person’s life is in serious or immediate danger.
Clinical studies have not been done on this to show that it is safe and effective for this disease.
China launched a mobile app in February 2020 to combat the outbreak of the disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
This app is able to detect the potential risk of infection by detecting 'near contact' using surveillance data.
Each user can also view the status of three other users.
If the potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but it also alerts local health authorities. Large data analyses for cellphone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and those they contacted in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled security agencies to track mobile phone data of people suspected of coronavirus.
The measure was taken to implement quarantine and protect those who came in contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared phone location data with the Robert Koch Institute, the German federal government agency for preventing the spread of the virus and research.
Russia employed facial recognition technology to detect those who violated the quarantine.
Italian regional health commissioner Julio Gallera said he had been informed by mobile phone operators that "40% of people are doing movement in some way."
The German government organized a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, called for a global call for creative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
People may experience distress from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection themselves.
“Augmented social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and an economic downturn is an ideal storm damaging people’s mental health and well-being,” the BBC quoted Rory O’Connor as saying.
The disease may have a mild procedure with or without some symptoms that resemble common colds such as other common upper respiratory tract diseases.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while cases with severe or severe diseases may take three to six weeks to recover.
Based on statistics from other similar viruses like SARS and MERS, pregnant women may have a higher risk of severe infection with COVID-19, but there is a lack of statistics for COVID-19. In some people, COVID-19 can cause pneumonia by affecting the lungs.
In the most severely affected people, COVID-19 can develop rapidly into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to respiratory failure, pulmonary trauma, or multi-organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal scrotum, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Scandinavian abnormalities, especially an increase in prothrombin time, have been reported in 6% of people hospitalized with COVID-19, while 4% of this group have abnormal kidney function.
About 20-30% of people infected with COVID-19 exhibit an increase in the liver enzymes.
According to the same information, the average time between the onset of symptoms and the death was ten days, with five days spent in hospital.
However, patients transferred to the ICU had an average time of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In one study of early cases, the average time from showing early symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), the mortality rate was 2.8% in men, while the mortality rate was 1.7% in women.
The tissue pathology tests of the lung samples of the autopsy show diffraction of aerosol damage with cell fibromyalgia leaks in both lungs.
In Pneumocytosis, viral cell pathological changes were observed.
The lung image looked similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Of the 11.8% deaths reported by China’s National Health Commission, heart damage was noted by high levels of troponin or heart rate stopping.
According to U.S. March statistics, 89% of people hospitalized had preexisting conditions. The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic status of an area can also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality from the situation vary due to those regional differences and also due to system related difficulties.
The mortality rate may be higher due to low count of mild cases.
However, the fact that the death is the result of the cases that have taken place earlier may mean that the present mortality rate has been underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 than non-smokers and nearly 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die. Concerns have been expressed about the long-term pathological symptoms of this disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20% to 30% drop in lung capacity in some people recovering from the disease, and lung scans showed organ damage.
It can also cause post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether the previous infection provided effective and long-term immunity in people recovering from the disease.
Immunizations are seen as possible based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases of positive testing for coronavirus have been reported at a later date after recovering from COVID-19.
These cases are considered to be worse of a non-cured infection rather than a re-infection.
The virus is believed to be of an animal origin that spreads from natural and animal to human through infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely by human-to-human transmission.
In a study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, the first date for the onset of symptoms was reported on December 1, 2019.
WHO official publications reported the earliest onset of symptoms on December 8, 2019.
A number of measures are commonly used to determine the mortality rate.
These numbers vary by region and time and are influenced by the amount of testing, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, past outbreaks, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, the WHO prescribed the emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 for deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by the laboratory and the number of deaths from COVID-19 diagnosed clinically or pandemicly without SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by the laboratory showed the number of deaths diagnosed U07.2. The death-case ratio is determined by the number of deaths diagnosed within a certain time interval.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the global death-case ratio as of 17 April 2020 is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
The number varies by region. Other measures include the Case Fatality Rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of individuals diagnosed with a disease, and the Infection Mortality Rate (IFR) which reflects the percentage of infected individuals who die from a disease (diagnosis and not diagnosed).
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection to case recovery.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about how many people have been infected.
In the center of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglion D'Eda, in a small village of 4600 people, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
The disease was spread by carnival festivals and in young people, reducing the relatively fatality rate, and not all COVID-19 deaths may have been formally classified.
In addition, the German health system has not cracked.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of blood donors can be immunocompromised, according to evaluations.
The death toll from COVID-19 has been confirmed to be 69 (0.004% of the population).
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate varies for men and women.
Studies conducted in China and Italy have higher mortality rates in men.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, and the gap between men and women decreases only at the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact causes of this gender-interference are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors can be a cause.
Gender-based immunological differences, lower prevalence of smoking in women and developing co-morbid conditions in men such as high blood pressure at a younger age than women may contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government is not tracking gender-related statistics of COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases like Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A high percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19."
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that CO means corona, VI means virus, D means disease, and 19 means the year when the outbreak was first identified i.e. December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (such as China), species of animals or a group of people that are in line with international recommendations for naming for the purpose of preventing insulting. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO additionally uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus."
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV as interim names for the acute respiratory disease virus and disease, which comply with 2015 guidelines for not using places in the disease and virus names.
The formal names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing parts of health materials such as Nasica Fah and ventilators.
In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a ventilator valve, and the supplier was unable to provide the required time-frame, a local startup printed the required 100 valves overnight by reverse-engineering.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy, misinformation and misleading information about the origin, level, prevention, treatment and other sides of the disease emerged and spread rapidly online.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
No medication or vaccine is approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs in COVID-19 is being carried out by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a "solidity trial" to assess the treatment effects of four existing antiviral compounds most likely to be effective.
There is no vaccine available at this time, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used as both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being tested.
First, the researchers aim to create an entire virus vaccine.
The goal of the use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is to generate a quick immune response of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19.
Another strategy, the subunit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain sub-parts of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on S-Kantak proteins that help the virus penetrate into the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, a new technique of vaccine-making).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies will have to be tested for safety and efficacy. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from a disease-causing virus. Antibody-dependent growth has been described as a potential challenge to vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2, but it is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are being conducted.
Seven trials were evaluating already approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Scheduled to be notified by the end of April, with nine phase III trials on Remdesivir in many countries, most Chinese research is working on repurposed antiviral drugs.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development was underway for COVID-19 vaccines and drug candidates. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including Remdesivir, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Interferon beta combined with Lopinavir/Ritanovavir and Interferon beta.
As of March 2020, experimental evidence is available for the efficacy of Remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with non-approved use of Remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine, already used for the treatment of malaria, was studied in February 2020 with initial results in China.
However, calls have been made for equivalence review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, recommending a daily dose of one gram, noted that twice as many doses are extremely dangerous and can be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use permit for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating people with COVID-19. Guidelines for the Chinese 7th edition also include Interferon, Ribavirin or Umifenovir for use for protection from COVID-19.
Initial data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary for the suppression of artificial ambient SARS-CoV-2.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further study in organisms after showing low concentrations of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that early incontinence protein priming by transambrane protease serin 2 (TMPRSS2) is necessary for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 by intravenously with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further study. Osaltamivir does not treat artificial ambient SARS-CoV-2 and has no known role in its COVID-19 treatment.
Increasing the amount of cytokine in the later stages of severe COVID-19 can be a complication.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have properties that prevent cytokine levels from increasing. Tokilizumab has been included in the treatment guidelines by China’s National Health Commission after a short study was completed.
It is undergoing phase 2 non-verbal testing at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with serum ferritin blood tests to identify an increase in the amount of cytokine, it aims to combat such angina, which is believed to cause death in some affected people.
Interleukin-6 receptor inhibitors were approved by the FDA in 2017, for a different reason, based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine refractory syndrome induced by CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transferring pure and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of people recovering from COVID-19 to those who need them is being tested as a non-vaccinated method of inactivated vaccination.
This strategy was used for SARS with inconclusive results.
Viral indifference is the expected mechanism by which passive antibody therapy can mediate protection from SARS-CoV-2.
However other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example using built-in monoclonal antibodies, are in development.
The production of health beneficial serum, which contains a liquid part of the blood of the recovered patients and is specific to this virus, can be increased for faster planning.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Lee Wenliang, a physician at the central hospital in Wuhan, became infected with COVID-19 and died after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
