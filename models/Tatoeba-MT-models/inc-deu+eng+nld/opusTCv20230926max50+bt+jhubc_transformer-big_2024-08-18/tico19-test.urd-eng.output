How long have these symptoms persisted?
All types of pain should be treated in the same way, especially at your age.
And with the heat.
You also need to check your blood pressure.
Are you still having a fever?
Do you have a pain in the neck now?

The overall spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK increased sharply from January 1 to March 15, 2020.
Similar trends are being expressed in the overall spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK, while the COVID-19 pandemic in all countries is accelerating at different stages depending on the country.
Based on Italy's experience, many countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparedness thanks to the rapid increase in COVID-19 patients as they will need intensive care in particular.
On December 31, 2019, a large number of cases of pneumonia of unknown origin were reported in Wuhan, China's Hubei province.
On January 9, 2020, China's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causal agent is novel coronavirus, now known as severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
However, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date has shown that 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild disease, with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
COVID-19 is a more serious illness in 14% of cases, requiring hospitalization, while those experiencing severe illness in 66% of cases require extreme care.
The mortality rate of patients admitted to the hospital due to COVID-19 is ca 4%.
In this study, we will assess trends in the overall spread of COVID-19 in each country in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the UK (UK) and compare them to that of Hubei province of China.
We also compare the recent number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK with Italy during January 31 to March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, there was a further geographical spread of COVID-19, and the dynamic state of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world is currently consistent with the same country.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
In the 5 March 2020 issue of the Eurosurveillance, Sparti et al reported the first European confirmed COVID-19 cases as defined by the WHO.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA, reported on January 24, 2020 by three French nationals returning from Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the UK, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported during today's date from 31 December 2019, of which 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths were in Italy alone.
Collecting the total number of COVID-19 cases and the total spread.
The European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) receives data from government sources in every country around the world, from only governmental sources, the Ministry of Health of the countries, national and regional health authorities and the World Health Organization's daily updates at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK and compare them with Italy.
As the spread of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the 14-day focused overall spread of COVID-19 taking into account the natural course of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the UK during the period January 1 to March 15, 2020.
We compared with Italy during the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020 and presented the total number of reported cases of each country as of 8:00 a.m. on 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 Trends in the EU/EEA Countries and the UK
In general, the 14-day focused total spread of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the UK is in line with the province of Hubei (China).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the overall spread of COVID-19 began to increase on February 21, and then accelerated on February 28, 2020.
This was largely due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but the overall spread of COVID-19 in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK has shown similar increasing trends(materials).
In Figure 2, the total number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK, in comparison with Italy during the period January 31 to March 15, 2020 has been shown.
It was highlighted that, as of March 15 at 8:00 a.m., just 3 weeks before or less, the total number of cases in 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK were previously reported, compared to Italy.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Trends observed in the overall spread of COVID-19 indicate that the global epidemic is growing at a comparative pace in all countries.
Despite the fact that countries are at different stages, variations in national public health response and different definitions of possible cases in countries and different protocols for patients' choice that must be tested for COVID-19, including catch-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors from the affected areas of Italy reported a situation in which 10% of COVID-19 patients needed extreme care and media reported that hospital and intensive care units in these areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, there are data on COVID-19 cases admissions to any hospital and/or intensive care unit for the EU/EEA level of 6% and %1 cases respectively (the figures are not shown).
However, recent surveillance data, including the completion of reported cases and the number of deaths, should be collected in a systematic manner.
A 2010-11 study showed that there has been a major shift in the availability of intensive care and mid-care beds to 4.2 beds per 100,000 population in Germany and Portugal in Europe.
This means that these countries will have resources such as low-income Italy (in 2010-11, there are 12.5 intensive care and mid-care beds for every 100,000 population).
Modelling scenarios relating to increased health care capacity, estimates of COVID-19 cases admitted to hospitals in each EU/EEA country and the UK that are <0x3E>90% more likely to exceed the scope of intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC's rapid assessment of COVID-19.
Since so far there are clusters of cases in EU/EEA countries and specific areas of the UK, and generally hospital and intensive care units define the region's population, priority data on cases and intensive care beds facilitate the availability of available numbers of regional units of 2 (NUTS-2).
The current trends from Italy and other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals, and intensive care units must prepare themselves for a permanent community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and the surge in COVID-19 patients, like in Italy, requires health care, especially intensive care.
As the latest ECDC Rapid Concern Assessment, a fast, active and comprehensive approach has been described as essential to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, which should be accompanied by a change in mitigation approach, if not implemented ahead of time.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to reduce the impact of the global pandemic.
Here is a small opportunity during which countries are likely to increase their control efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on health care providers.
By failing to do so, it is likely that health care providers in the EU/EEA countries will face a need for extreme care due to an increase in patients in the coming days or weeks.
The spread of SARS-CoV-2, the most severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), caused by the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has so far affected more than 3,000 deaths and more than 80,000 people anywhere in China and the world, resulting in devastating to humans.
Like its homologous virus SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also be spread by bats and causes similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
However, the severity and mortality of COVID-19 are lower than that of SARS, but it affects older people and women more than young people.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications about emerging disease, this article attempts to offer a timely and comprehensive review of a rapidly developing research article.
We will cover the basics of pandemics, virology, epidemics, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and disease prevention.
While many questions still need answers, we hope that this review will be helpful in understanding and eliminating this dangerous disease.
The 25 January 2020 Spring Festival became an unprecedented and unforgettable memorial for all Chinese residents due to the outbreak of the novel viral disease, urging all holidays and several weeks of stay at home.
The virus is highly homologous with coronavirus (CoV), which caused severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) to spread in 2003. Thus, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and its associated disease is known as COVID-19.
The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread to nearly 50 other countries across the country and around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported, with 40,000 patients recovering and 3,000 deaths as a result of the virus.
The WHO has warned that COVID-19 is "the people's No. 1 enemy" and is more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19 in less than two months, including its virology, epidemics, causes, treatment and diagnosis after the first report of January 7, 2020, which has been scheduled to isolate multiple patients.
This review attempts to summarize the creative advances in the new and rapidly evolving subject area.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with the disease caused by SARS and another CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS that spread in 2012).
We will also talk about what we have learned so far about the diagnosis and prevention of the disease, as well as some of the important questions that remain.
For humans, CoV has traditionally been considered non-hazardous pathogens, mainly leading to about 15% of the common flu.
However, in this century we have had two very deadly CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused the outbreak in China and Saudi Arabia in 2003 and in 2012 respectively, and soon the terrible disease spread to many other countries with its mortality rate.
COVID-19 is the third pandemic in human history.
As shown in the form, Figure.1, in Figure 1, of the pneumonia cluster whose sources are unknown, was first reported to the China National Health Commission from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the CoV order was issued.
The first case was reported in Wuhan on January 15, 2020.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, an infection was reported in health care providers, meaning it was possible to transmit it from person to person.
On January 23, all public transport in the city of Wuhan was shut down.
The first medical study on the disease reported on January 24 that, out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which is considered the site of the outbreak by an unknown means of animals.
On January 30, the WHO declared the pandemic a global health emergency.
By the time of the arrival of this report, the disease had already spread to about 50 countries across China and around the world (severely.2).
As the situation is evolving rapidly, the final scope and severity of the epidemic remains to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, were described in a multi-dimensional study as one of the freshest explanations of the outbreak (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-H<0x58><0x5F>rHP<0x58>a1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 affects people of all ages, but especially those aged 65-30 years.
About half (47.7) of those affected were over 50 years of age, much less than 20 years of age, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 has affected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has mainly spread to Hobby and surrounding areas.
The average COVID-19 diagnosis was 5 (9-2) days from the start.
The average duration of growth was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from start to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
According to the time of mass transportation ahead of the Spring Fair in China, the number of infected people increased rapidly before June 23, 2020.
The mortality rate of patients with confirmed cases was %1.44 (%95 Cl:1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate of all patients was %3.06 (%95 Cl:2.02-4.59%).
The three major risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of a large and malignant viruses, which are part of the synthesis of the RNA of the sense.
They are divided into four genera, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alpha and beta-CoVs are known to affect humans.
Malfoy Spike (S) glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the peptide peptides 4 (DPP4), respectively, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and then fusion of the membrane.
Viral genes are released into the cytoplasma, then, following a copy of the viral gene, the genomes form a version of the molecule with RNA, consisting of the molecule glycolytic lymphocytes, and the New Clio cassidorin, which then fuses to release the virus with the plasma membrane.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
In Wuhan, 10 samples collected from the original location of the Wuhan seafood market, respectively, more than 99.98% of SARS-CoV-2 was found to have a new type of BTA genetic identification.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more common than SARS-CoV.
Thanks to the transfer of electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been found on the very thin part of the human respiratory tract's application.
Human ACE2 has been found not only as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 but also for SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2's more vulnerable approach to SARS-CoV is linked to A human ACE2, which agrees with the fact that SARS-CoV causes fewer infections than SARS-CoV-2.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form secretive lymph nodes and orf8 encoded by orf3b.
SARS-CoV-2's orf3b can play a role in viral pathogenicity and express itself in IFNB, although there is no known active domain or form of orf8.
On 18 February 2020, Zhao et al., reported a complex resolution in the structure of EM in the full length of human ACE2 to 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> islands with amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complexity, in which open and closed changes were gathered as a dimer, and the ACE2-B0AT1 complexity could bind to two S-proteins, which constitute the identification and proof of COV.
B0AT1 can be a treatment for screening of drugs in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The original and Damanian representative
It is well known that, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, starting from both bats, have been transmitted to humans through citrus cats and camels.
By comparing SARS-CoV-2 with other COVs, bats are considered to be the local representative of SARS-CoV-2, because the new virus is similar to the two SARS-like SARS-CoVs of bats, such as the Beta-SL-CoVZ<0x58>45 and the Beta-SL-CoVZ<0x58>21.
However, it is not yet known what mediators have helped cross barriers to affect humans, and the route of transmission is yet to be explained.
G, et al., had suggested snakes as virus disease repellents from bats to humans, including homologous replication within the S protein.
According to a study in Guangzhou, China, researchers have suggested that 99% of the genetically engineered compounds found in long-snout pangolins, ant-eating memels, pigolins, and SARS-CoV-2, which are often used in traditional Chinese medicine, may be a potential intermediate representative of SARS-CoV-2.
However, the %1 difference of spread between the two genomes is still a huge difference, similarly, the final results of the comprehensive evidence are awaited (slightly.(slightly.33).
Most physiological properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive up to 48 hours in dry environments and less than 20<0xC2><0xB0>C and up to 40%-50% in moisture for 5 days.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may be sensitive to bactericidal ions, and by a heat of 56<0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes, or 75% of ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, parasitic acid, chlorophyll, and other fatty germs.
In general, the entire human population lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and therefore they are vulnerable to the novel virus.
Currently, no detailed study has been reported on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
In this way, we can refer to previous studies about other CoVs especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV(severe.(severe.4).
Usually when a representative is attacked by a virus, the immune system of this representative is through the first type of receptors (PRRs), which have C-type lactonal receptors, TLRs, NAD-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-repellent receptors (RRs).
Through a variety of methods, the virus inflammatory factors, the maturity of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of the number I type of interferon (IFNs), which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate its viral antigens, micro-fungal phagocytosis.
However, the N lymphatic system of SARS-CoV can help prevent the virus from immune response.
Soon, the adaptive immune response becomes involved in the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including <0x2B>CD4 and <0x2B>CD8, play an important role in the defense of cells.
To develop specific antibodies to the virus, T cells of <0x2B>CD4 stimulate B cells and T cells of <0x2B>CD8 directly kill virus-infected cells.
T assistive cells develop pro-inflammatory cytokines to help protect the immune cells.
However, CoV to T can inhibit the functions of T cells by inducing apoptosis.
Hormonal immunity, including C3a and C5a and antibody supplements, are essential to combat viral infections.
For example, MERS-CoV is neutralized by the antibodies isolated from the recovered patient.
On the other hand, excesses in the immune system cause many free radicals locally that can damage the lungs and other organs, and, the worst case scenario is to stop many organs from functioning and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection is noticeable from the onset of clustering, and is more likely to affect older and pregnant women.
It is common in people who have two to four of a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are weak, and are more likely to be infected than others.
Based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan, the growth duration of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated at an average of 14-1 days, mostly 7-3 days.
However, according to a study conducted on 1,099 cases, the average duration of growth is 3 days and 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned above, a recent study shows that the duration of growth based on 8,866 cases was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
It is very important for health authorities to determine the effective time of quarantine based on the most appropriate period of growth to protect people from transmission of the virus from people who are infected but have not shown symptoms.
In general, people who are infected or infected with the virus need to quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
Often the main and early symptom of COVID-19 is fever, with no other symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, knee, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experience shortness of breath and/or shocks a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients with severe respiratory syndrome, septic shocks, metabolic acidity, and freezing improve immediately.
Fever and/or respiratory symptoms and severe fever, even with normal pulmonary imaging, should be checked for early diagnosis of patients.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 found that 98% of patients with fever, 76% of dry cough, 55% of those with respiratory problems and 33% of those with diarrhea needed ventilation support.
In two recent studies, similar results have been found about the cause of a stroke through a transfer from a householder and a non-symptomatic person.
In comparison, a 2012 study showed that patients with MERS-CoV also had basic symptoms of fever (98), dry cough (47), and shortness of breath (55).
However, 80% of them needed ventilation support, much more than COVID-19 patients, and MERS is more deadly than COVID-19.
Patients with MERS also saw diarrhea (%26) and throat inflammation(%21).
It has been proven that in SARS patients, fever (100-99%), dry cough (75-29%), shortness of breath (42-40%), diarrhea (25-20%) and throat inflammation (25-13%) are important symptoms, and about 20-14% of the patients needed the help of vaccination.
As of February 14, when the number of confirmed cases reached 66,576 globally, the COVID-19 mortality rate was 2%.
In comparison, as of November 2002, the death rate in confirmed cases of SARS was 8,096 percent.
Based on a demographic study in June 2012, the mortality rate in 2,494 confirmed cases of MERS was 37%.
A previous study showed that the R0 fertility rate of SARS-CoV-2 was higher to 6.47 with a confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23 percent, while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
This module 1.1 presents a comparison of SARS-CoV-2's symptoms, mortality and reproductive numbers with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
The above data suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher spread potential than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less deadly than both later viruses.
Therefore, it is more difficult to control the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 than the outbreak of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Often the start of a storm, with the same household, or with the same gathering or ride-like ships.
Often patients have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas, or contact with infected people or patients in recent two weeks prior to the onset.
However, it has been reported that people can keep the virus inside for two weeks without showing symptoms, and patients who have recovered from the hospital can again be infected by the virus, which rings the bell to extend the quarantine period.
In these patients, white blood cells were found to be low or equal at the initial level (especially lymphocytes).
For example, the number of white blood cells <0x3C> 4<0xC3><0x97>109/L in lymphocytes including the number of lymphocytes <0x3C> 1<0xC3><0x97>109/L, and the level and vermia of sprite amenotransferases were found in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
In some patients' liver and muscles, the level of myoglobin in the liver and blood increased, and in most patients' blood levels of C-inactivated lymphoma and etherocytosis increased.
In patients with severe cases, the D-diamer in the blood, lack of pharyngitis, was increased, so the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
The usual features against the chest radiography of COVID-19 patients show blurring on two-way complex shadows or ground glass in the lungs.
In most patients, common pneumonia, acute lung pain, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Inhalation syndrome, uncontrolled inflammation, a collection of fluids and increasing fibrosis are largely compromised in the exchange of gas.
The inactivation of the pneumococcals of type I and type II lowers the surface of the head fectant and increases the surface tension, thus reducing the risk of lung spread and their failure.
Therefore, the worst radiographic results of the chest are parallel to the extreme extent of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, SARS and MERS patients like and according to the pathology of ARDS and viral infections, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 resulted in the formation of pneumococytosis, hyalene membrane formation, and infiltration of the middle lymphocytes, and multicellular cyanoids in the lungs of the patient who died from the disease.
The use of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 was an important criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
In China, on February 13, 2020, due to the high rate of negative lie, which can exacerbate the epidemic, medical data use for diagnosis was started (which is no longer entirely dependent on RT-PCR).
The same thing happened with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, for an effective diagnosis, in the history of the disease, medical specifications, laboratory tests, and radiological results must be of all.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang Group described a protocol for the use of the CRISPR-based sherlock technique to detect SARS-CoV-2 without the need for artificial SARS-CoV-2 to use RNA pieces of 20x10-18 microliter/liter 200x10-18 microliters.
Hopefully, if confirmed in medical samples, the new technique will dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience.
Due to the lack of experience with Novel CoV, primarily therapists can provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while also trying different treatment regimens that were previously suggested or used to treat other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (table 2).
These methods of treatment include current and potential antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of recovered patients, Chinese medicine, and psychotherapy.
Even plasma of recovered patients was suggested to be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are in the race to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
Initially, SARS-CoV-2 attacks mainly on the lungs, and perhaps a small amount of ACE2 expression other organs such as the stomach and kidneys.
However, respiratory disorders and lung failure are the biggest risk and cause of death for the patient.
Therefore, to help relieve symptoms and save lives, include general oxygen, rapid flow of oxygen, uninterrupted ventilation, and mechanical interference ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe pain in the respiratory system have to be helped by the use of the modified cardio pulmonary bypass technique to treat a life-threatening heart attack or respiratory failure, through the respirator corticosteroid oxygen membrane (ECMO).
Additionally, for the maintenance of electrolyte, the treatment and prevention of secondary infection and septic shock are necessary to protect vital organ functions in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is said that the excess of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS results in cytokine syndrome.
Cytokine is a type of systematic inflammatory response produced by a series of cytokines including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokine contain immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of severe pain syndrome and failure of various organs in the respiratory system.
Immunosuppression is essential for treatment of cytokine syndrome, especially in severely ill patients.
Corticosteroid Insects and Toxyzomobe have been used as an anti-IL6 molecular antibody for the treatment of cytokine syndrome.
In the treatment of suppressing other immune systems of the cytokine stream; inhibiting IFN-y,IL-1 and TNF; inhibiting JAK; suppressing nerve cell 4; and inhibiting HADC, directed modification of the T cell of the immune response.
The steroid was widely used as a treatment for reducing the severity of inflammation loss in SARS.
However, heavy doses of steroids were not beneficial in lung disease in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, it can cause severe side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis affects the diagnosis in a dramatic way.
Despite this, acutely ill patients with COVID-19 have been advised to use short courses of corticosteroids with caution.
So far, no effective anti-viral treatment has been confirmed.
However, in a U.S. patient with COVID-19, with a vaccine remittance, the nucleoside analog was found to be effective.
Remetsauer is a novel antiviral drug, originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, remittances were made possible to prevent other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
Based on this, Gilead provided a combination of this to China for a couple of trials on people affected by SARS-CoV-2, with results much higher than expected.
In addition, barbiturates, interferon-a, lupinavir/retonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested for possible treatment for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
In the case of treatment combined with lupinavir/retonavir, diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur.
The combination of this treatment with other medications used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from Recovered Patients and Antibody Generation
There is a long history of collecting blood from patients recovering from this infectious disease to treat other patients with this disease or to protect healthy people from this disease.
In fact, most recovered patients have relatively high levels of antibodies against pathogens in their blood.
Antibody is an immunoglobulin(Ig) that helps fight pathogens and other external objects through B lymphocytes and identify unique molecules on pathogens and directly neutralize them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and admitted to 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms such as inflammation and viral load and lack of oxygen in the blood improve in 24 hours.
However, the specific treatment has not yet been developed, so it is important to confirm and explain before suggesting its widespread use.
In addition, along with seeing the effects of the treatment, some of the disadvantages associated with plasma should also be considered.
For example, the antibody increases the immune response, and can cause cytokine's release syndrome, which is potentially life-threatening poisoning.
In general, the number of antibodies in the blood is low, and the demand for plasma is high for the treatment of severely ill patients.
It is difficult to develop specific antibodies so quickly to fight the global pandemic.
Separating B cells from recovered patients and screening an effective antibody against the essential immunity of the virus to identify genetic code is a delicate and difficult process.
In this way, we can speed up the process of antibody preparation.
Traditional Chinese medicine has been used in China for thousands of years to treat various diseases.
However, its effects largely depend on the combination of several ingredients in a formula, which depends on the diagnosis of a disease based on the theories of traditional Chinese medicine.
Many effective ingredients are unknown or vague because it is difficult to extract and verify such ingredients or their best combinations.
Currently, traditional Chinese medicine has become an important alternative treatment for mild to moderate symptoms or patients who have recovered from severe stage, due to a lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19.
For example, Zhou Feng G Lu capsules and Li Huang Cheng van capsules have been proven to be effective in treating COVID-19.
In several provinces of China, including Gansu (63.7%), Nanjia (50%) and Hanan (50%), saw a higher rate of improvement in the treatment of patients using traditional Chinese medicine in 87% of their patients, while Hobby Province, which used traditional Chinese medicine at a lower rate of 13% of its COVID-19 patients, used only 30% of those (or all of them).
However, this is a fairly strict comparison, as the effects of this analysis should include many other factors such as the number and severity of patients.
On February 18, 2020, Biel Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing the treatment of Western Medicine and Western Medicine (WM) with traditional Chinese medicine.
They found that only Western medicine <0x2B> traditional Chinese medicine group had physical temperature recovery, symptoms reduction, and hospital stay periods, significantly lower than the time required.
Extremely impressive, the symbolically increasing symptom (light to severe) was significantly lower in the WM group alone than the WM<0x2B>TCM group (7.4% compared to 46.2%) and the mortality rate (39%) was significantly lower.
Nevertheless, traditional Chinese medicine is still awaiting more good and control trials of its performance and safety in large-scale and more centers.
It would be interesting to highlight the process of treating traditional Chinese medicine, describing their effective ingredients or their combinations, if possible.
Suspects or confirmed COVID-19 patients are most highly contagious and even afraid of deadly disease, and quarantined people are prone to boredom, loneliness, and anger.
Furthermore, the symptoms of infection such as fever, shock, and cough, as well as the negative effects of treatment such as cardiac steroids, can lead to insomnia, more anxiety, and mental stress.
In the early stages of SARS, a series of psychiatric patients have reported chronic mental stress, anxiety, panic attacks, psychosis, psychosis symptoms, depression, and suicide.
Tracking and quarantine contacts as part of the public health coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic can make people more anxious and guilty about the impact of the conflict, quarantine and stigma on their families and friends.
Similarly, COVID-19 patients, suspects, people who are in contact with them, as well as the general public, should provide mental health care to those in need.
Physiological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, the establishment of clear communication with consistent and accurate updates on the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and its treatment plans, and close contact with each other.
An effective vaccine is needed to prevent transmission of the virus to animal enclosures, and sensitive representatives from infected humans, and antiviral treatments are often necessary to control the emerging virus epidemic.
Efforts have been made to develop S-Lhama-based vaccines to develop long-term and antioxidant neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS.
Vaccines that have a direct impact on animal models for SARS were analyzed.
However, the efficacy of these vaccine candidates in protecting elderly people, deadly challenge samples and animal virus infections cannot be determined before the start of medical studies.
This is because the SARS ended 17 years ago and so far no new cases have been reported.
On the other hand, in regions other than the Middle East, where animals have permanent sourced areas of the virus, there is a continuation of the MERS shrapnel.
The MERS vaccine strategy has been developed using sub-units of viruses such as DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viruses and recovered lithium, and some of these have been tested on animal samples.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunocompromised individuals is an urgent and important task to overcome the pandemic.
However, overcoming this difficulty is a challenge due to the need for long-term (average 18 months) for vaccine development and the dynamic variations of CoVs.
COVID-19 has begun to show its medical course in thousands of patients, as a novel disease.
In most cases, patients can recover slowly without any complications.
However, COVID-19, like SARS and MERS, is also associated with higher disease and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, health care agencies must create a diagnostic model of the disease to prioritize their services in low-resourced areas.
Based on medical studies so far reported, the following factors may be associated with the diagnosis or impact of COVID-19 patients (table 33).
Age: Age was the most important factor for the diagnosis of SARS, which is now also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly occurred in people aged 65-30 years, 47.7% of the 8,866 patients in the above-mentioned study were over 50 years of age.
Patients who are more likely to have underlying rabies complications are more likely to require extreme care, and those who do not have such complications (average age of 66 years instead of 51 years), which presents age as a diagnostic process for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: As mentioned above, SARS-CoV-2 affects men more than women (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.27/100,000).
We're concerned about the severity of complications: COVID-19 patients who need extreme care are at risk for severe heart and respiratory attacks.
The most common cause of death in SARS patients is heart attacks.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also be linked to the positive cholangusitis of ACE2, which can lead to liver damage in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age and primary disease have a strong relationship and they can interfere with each other.
Unprecedented results of the laboratory: the level of C-reactive lymph nodes (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been suggested as a possible analytical process for the treatment response and final recovery of the disease.
C-reactive lymphatic level linkages have been suggested for the severity and diagnosis of COVID-19.
Additionally, elevated lactate dehydrogenases (LDH), aspirate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinases can also help predict the results.
These enzymes are expressed in numerous organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released through tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional targets of heart or liver damage.
Important medical symptoms: The radiography of the chest and the temporary improvement of medical symptoms should be considered in combination with other tissues to predict the consequences and complications of COVID-19.
The use of steroids: As mentioned above, as an adjunct treatment in infectious disease, it is commonly used to suppress the immune system of steroids to reduce the severity of inflammation damage.
Since a large amount of carticosteroids were widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors suffered avascular osteoncrosis with a lifetime of disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, a very small amount of steroid should be used for short-term use in COVID-19 patients.
Mental Tension: As mentioned above, many patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, suffered from abnormal tension due to prolonged quarantine tolerance and observing the irrational death of close family and fellow patients.
Psychological counseling and long-term support are essential to bring these patients back to normal life.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 appear to be different from SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 in addition to clinging to the lower respiratory tract, can also cling to the upper respiratory tract, and cause mild or no symptoms, like the common cold caused by other CoVs in the early stages of the infection.
Therefore, infected patients in the initial stage or in the growth period can produce large amounts of viruses during daily activities, making it very difficult to control the epidemic.
However, the transmission of SARS-CoV occurs when the patient is severely ill, while there is not much transmission in the initial stage.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is far more severe than the SARS epidemic and is quite difficult to control.
At present, in China, there are hopes and efforts to disrupt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by locking down Wuhan and surrounding cities and keeping the entire population in continuous quarantine.
While these measures are dramatically damaging the country's economy and other sectors, it is reducing the number of new patients, which is a sign of slowing down of the pandemic.
Fortunately, the pandemic will end in March and the phase of its Dawson Swing will take place in three to four months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., has estimated that COVID-19, which seems to be a far more infectious disease than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longi et al., set up a model to predict the consequences of the global pandemic, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 could affect two-thirds of the global population.
A Canadian group said both mid-turban and throat swabs of patients who had recovered from the hospital two weeks ago showed they had been infected with SARS-CoV-2, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a circulatory tract of influenza.
However, based on the decline in the number of new cases, there are promising indicators in China, which indicate that the current strategy is working.
In fact, one million cases were predicted with half a million deaths in Ebola.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has finally been overcome.
It is also possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is vulnerable to the spread of the disease and eventually ends up being present with humans like a low-infected virus.
The following form provides a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS (55).
SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted by coughing or sneezing and possibly by direct contact with contaminated material from the virus.
This virus is also found in the cell, which creates a new possibility of transmission from the cell to the mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases showed that 41 percent of the cases were likely due to non-negative infections, 17 patients with pre-existing diseases and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, people, especially health care providers, social workers, homeowners, colleagues, and even those in contact with patients or affected people should be very careful.
To reduce the risk of infection, the first piece of defense is to wear a mask on the face; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (Series <0x23>1860s) helps to control the spread of the virus.
Surgical masks prevent liquid droplets from a potential infected person from traveling through the air or sticking to the surfaces of objects from where they can reach others.
However, only N95 (Serial <0x23>1860) masks can protect against the inhalation of small virus particles from 10 to 80 nm, only 5% of virus particles can enter completely, SARS-CoV-2 is the same as SARS-CoV in size, both are about 85 nm.
Even though five surgical masks are added together, this particle can penetrate them, so health care providers who have direct contact with patients should wear N95 (Serial <0x23>1860s) masks instead of surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care workers should wear a self-isolating gown to reduce contact with the virus.
The virus can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2, although he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus probably entered his inflammatory eyes.
Therefore, health care providers should wear a transparent shield or fountain on the face when working with patients.
It is highly advisable for the public of affected or potentially affected areas to wash their hands more often than usual with disinfected soaps, try to quarantine themselves indoors and limit contact with potentially infected people.
A distance of three feet from the patient is considered appropriate distance.
These functions are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus in the human world, it is a high homogeneity of SARS-CoV, as reported in January 7, 2020, and should cause a high alert for China based on the deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, on January 19, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Wuhan reassured citizens that the novel virus had less infectious and limited reproductive capacity from human to human and that prevention and control of the disease was not an issue.
The message gave the public's alarm, especially as they were preparing for the Spring Festival, and wasted time in Wuhan to control the disease on a minimal scale.
In China, disease control agencies may have made significant improvements in the future by learning from this difficult.
For example, these agencies must be careful when making public announcements (1) as each word is important to the citizens and can change their behavior and decisions; (2) to improve the effectiveness of the system and the effectiveness of the system; (2) to increase the effectiveness of the practice and the effectiveness of the system; (4) to control and respond to the general information of the clinic at the time of the pandemic, rather than to provide relief to the public; (3) to the initial stages of the pandemic.
The COVID-19 pandemic began in December 2019 with the novel virus SARS-CoV-2.
In less than two months, it has spread across China and around 50 other countries globally.
Since the virus is similar to SARS-CoV and symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the spread of COVID-19 has created a sense of the resurgence of SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for keeping the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects more men than women and older people, and has a higher severity and mortality rate in older people than younger people.
SARS mortality rates are higher than COVID-19 (%1.44 compared to %10.91).
COVID-19 patients can transmit the virus even when they do not have symptoms, while SARS patients do so when they are severely ill, making it more difficult to prevent the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 is faster and wider than the relatively SARS-CoV.
In some COVID-19 patients, regular RNA may be negative for SARS-CoV-2.
Otherwise, the virus can once again be positive in patients who have recovered.
These results dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Given the rapid advances in COVID-19 research, a number of key issues remain to be resolved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96 percent of the genetic homogeneity between SARS-CoV-2 and two-bit SARS-like CoV has been found, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 came from bats.
Who was the first person to transmit the virus to humans?
Without knowing the answer to <0x23>1 and 2, we cannot effectively reduce the transfer process and it can spread again at any time.
Although molecular modelling and biochemical testing show that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with this ACE2, how does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and how does it result in pathological changes?
Is the virus also linked to cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without the right answers to these questions, we cannot achieve a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long the disease will continue.
How does the virus develop genetically during transmission to humans?
Is it going to be a global pandemic, end up like SARS, or will it continue to be as deadly as time goes on?
This is important, but it may take some time to find answers to the above and some other questions.
However, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and get our lives back to normal.
The origins of human coronaviruses
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations, including humans, have advanced the mutual evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their host animals.
Prior to 2003, two human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were known for common colds such as mild illness.
The acute respiratory distress system (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory system (MERS) have called for measures to show how destructive and life-threatening HCoV infection can be.
The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 once again highlighted CoVs and its rapid transmission and reduction in pathogenicity compared to its sister SARS-CoV surprised us.
HCoV infection is an infection transmitted from animals to humans and it serves us to understand the animal source of HCoV.
Most HCoVs originate from bats where they are non-pathogenic.
Some HCoVs are also known to be the intermediate host of deposits.
Identify host animals that have a direct impact on the prevention of human diseases.
An investigation into the CoV-hosted animal in animals leads to significant awareness of pathogenic coV in humans.
In this review, we present a review on the existing knowledge about the seven HCoVs, in which we focus on the history of their discovery, as well as their animal origins and mixed species transmissions.
Importantly, we compare and differentiate different HCoVs from the point of view of the evolution of different viruses and the regeneration of their genes.
In this context, the current COVID-19 pandemic will be discussed.
In addition, the effects of the virus on the requirements for successful host animal changes and the severity of the disease have been highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the coronavirus family, which includes a group of malignant, positive, single-stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses, which used large genes such as 26 to 32 kilobytes between RNA viruses, were called "CoV" due to the appearance of crown-like morphology from the electron microscope.
Structurally, COVs contain non-conforming genes that participate in the same organization.
About two-thirds of the genome consists of two large open frames of reading on each other (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the polynomial diagrams of pp1a and pp1ab.
This polynomial acts on a further 16 non-formal elasticities, designated nsp1<0x7E>16.
The rest of the genome consists of ORFs for structural lesion, including nocturnal(S), malfoil(E), membrane (M) and neo-collithic (N).
A large number of specific series of assistive mechanisms are also encoded through different sequences of CoVs.
Based on the difference in the configuration of the lattice, the four generations of CoVs (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV) are classified, with the Beta-CoV generation mostly composed of HCoVs and further divided into clusters (A,B,C and D).
Evidence from the phylo genome showed that, most bats and rats are the source of the genes of alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while the largest deposits of Gamma-CoV and Delta-CoV are birds.
For thousands of years, CoVs constantly crossed the barriers of different species and some of them emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been identified.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
Common symptoms such as HCoV-229, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 are mild cold and/or diarrhea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, which in relatively and more patients with severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extremity of extremity can lead to lower respiratory tract infections with a higher likelihood of developing acute respiratory symptoms.
In the mid-1960s, strains of HCoV-229E, B814, isolated nasal discharges from mild cold patients.
Since then, more and more information has been collected through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, before the spread of SARS, the concept was widely accepted that infection with HCoVs in general is harmless.
The SARS epidemic, which occurred in 2003, is the most devastating event in current history, with more than 8,000 people infected with the deadly disease with a mortality rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of respiratory syndrome (MERS) in the Middle East resulted in a permanent outbreak in the Arabian Peninsula that spread to the whole world.
The 2019 Novel (2019-nCoV, later named SARS-CoV-2), is the causative agent of the 2019 ongoing coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), which claimed more than 3,120 lives and affected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm is ringing and the world has to prepare for the impending global pandemic SARS-CoV-2.
The source animals of all seven HCoVs are bats, rats, or domestic animals.
Multiple lines of evidence support the evolution of all HCoVs from primates to bats, where viruses exhibit well-adapted and non-pathogenic but high genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented countless medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for China and the world.
The source animal tracking of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding natural history, the power of spread, and the mechanisms of restriction of transmission to different species.
This may also help or guide the finding of SARA-CoV-2's reserves, intermediates, and rearing animal hosts with significant implications in preventing recurrence in the future.
In this review, we will present an overview of the pathogens of the source animals, mixed species migration, and HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight this shared idea and discuss that the paternal viruses of HCoVs are usually nonpathogenic in the host animals of their natural reserves and become pathogenic after the transfer to their new host organism.
We also look at the evolution of HCoVs, which often lead to an increase in transmission with a decrease in pathogenic genes.
The results of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak have also been discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
HCoV-229E strain B814, previously isolated from the nose of mild cold patients, was isolated from various animals infected with various COVs, including turkeys, rats, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In the past decade, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of HCoVs (table 1) in terms of historical order will be informative and educational.
In 1966, the HCoV-229E pressure was isolated before patients with respiratory tract infections, and was later adopted to extend the WI-38 lung cell lines.
Between 10 and 20 percent of patients with HCoV-229E have mild colds, including headaches, sneezing, restlessness, and symptoms of throat inflammation with fever and cough.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from the organ culture and then put into the serial path of the small rat brain.
The medical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to those who have had HCoV-229E, which are not symptomaticly different from other respiratory pathogens like influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed globally, and these are more widespread in moderate climates during the winter.
Usually, the growth time of these two viruses is less than a week, after which the disease lasts for about 2 weeks.
According to a voluntary study of humans, infected with HCoV-229E of healthy individuals produces a mild cold.
Only a few patients with compromised immune systems have a severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as "a common pneumonia," was first well documented in human history as a global epidemic caused by HCoV and is the SARS-CoV atypical agent, the third discovered HCoV.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to late 2002 in Zhejiang province of China.
The SARS epidemic, which spread to many countries and continents, resulted in 8,096 cases with 774 deaths.
In addition to the rapid spread, it was estimated that each case, which has a growth period of 4 to 7 days, and the 10th day of the disease is at the viral load limit and can increase about two secondary cases.
The patient suffering from SARS-CoV initially has symptoms of muscle pain, headaches, fever, nausea, and cold, followed by diarrhea, coughing, and shortness of breath.
Lempho pancreas, abnormal laboratory tests of SARS have liver abnormal function and some elevated creatine kinases are common.
In SARS patients, the dispersion damage of the alveolar, the spread of epithelial cells, and the addition of macrophages are also observed.
Then about 20 to 30 percent of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In these severe cases, a number of organs, including the lower respiratory tract, liver and kidney, can be affected, usually with the cytokine Strom, which can be fatal in patients with low immunity.
For the first time, the virus was isolated from the open lung biopsy of an index patient's relative, who had traveled from Zhongzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, great efforts have been devoted to the research of HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was separated from a 7-month-old baby from the Netherlands during the end of 2004.
Initially, it is found in younger children, the elderly, and low-strength patients with respiratory disease.
The disease caused by HCoV-BL63 is common in nasal membrane inflammation, achy eyes, fever, and urinary tract inflammation.
Another independent study described separating the same virus from an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands from a nose sample.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it was actually distributed globally.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 is about 4.7% in the common respiratory disease, and its symptoms are severe in the beginning of summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with rottial insertion cough, also known as cramping.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized due to pneumonia and respiratory tract infections.
With inflammation in the community-acquired pneumonia and vascular tract, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with severe asthma.
Similarly, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, with mild respiratory disease, were found worldwide.
These four community-acquired HCoVs are very well compatible with humans and are generally less likely to cause a mutation in them to cause extreme pathogenic disease, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons, as reported in the more severe subtype of HCoV-NL63, a rare case of acute infection in the lower respiratory tract.
Usually, when these HCoVs have the ability to move and sustain themselves continuously inside humans, they become low-intensity malignant or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient in Saudi Arabia suffering from severe pneumonia and kidney failure.
Where most of the confirmed cases from the laboratory are found in the Middle East, and sometimes with secondary outbreaks in close contacts, imported cases are found in European countries and Tunisia.
A secondary outbreak with 186 confirmed cases was reported in South Korea in 2015.
The medical specifications of MERS are similar to those of SARS, which has the characteristics of advanced acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, MERS causes severe kidney failure in a number of patients, which is very unique to MERS in diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30% of patients have symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2500 confirmed cases of MERS-CoV had 34.4% of deaths, making MERS-CoV one of the most lethal viruses found in humans.
During mid-December 2019, a large number of pneumonia patients linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection were last detected from Hubei province, Wuhan, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has described the ongoing respiratory tract infection outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a global concern, calling it a public health emergency, and named it COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, of which 3.4% have died.
In particular, the death toll in these cases in Hobby, China is 4.2%, while out of it it it is 1.2%.
Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also causes severe respiratory infections and is presented as fever, cough, and diarrhea.
The condition has also been seen in some patients.
One of the most severe symptoms is pneumonia and it can increase acute respiratory syndrome.
Although 82% of high nucleotides have a constant similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, it is a flag of different branches of the pathogenic tree.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus appears to be less pathogenic but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 reported symptoms of non-symptomatic subjects that could contribute to its rapid spread around the world.
There are many interesting similarities and differences in comparisons and contrasts with the other six HCoVs of SARS-CoV-2.
First of all, HCoVs are very similar in the duration and duration of the disease's growth.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the other four from the community (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, it has generally been observed that during an infection of HCoVs derived from the SARS-CoV-2 community, including those with no specific, mild, or no symptoms, show the characteristics of their infection.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen as SARS-CoV infection, although this ratio is somewhat lower.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 shows interesting features like the HCoVs and SARS-CoVs derived from the community.
On the one hand, the minimum transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as high as the community received from HCoVs.
On the other hand, it remains to be confirmed that, like cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after entering the human being.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in grace samples.
Although there are at least some circumstances that remain to be explained in future studies whether SARS-CoV-2, like the case of SARS-CoV, plays an important role in oral fetal transfer.
It will also be of particular interest to see if SARS-CoV-2, like the HCoVs derived from the community, will appear seasonally.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including transmission, pathogenicity, and sustainable spread of COVID-19 after it enters humans will have an impact on the final outcome of the ongoing pandemic.
By adapting well in humans, all four of the community-acquired HCoVs cause mild symptoms.
From another point of view, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both types can be survivors of the global epidemic of chronic HCoVs.
HCoVs that cause severe diseases in humans and humans who suffer from severe HCoV diseases have been eliminated.
To do this, enough to counter the host animal restriction and the HCoVs collecting the desired change will have to be replicated in humans.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic lasts and the more people affected, the more likely it is that humans will adopt it completely.
If it is adopted well, then it will be difficult to prevent its transmission to humans through quarantine or other measures that control infection.
For many years, four CoVs derived from the community have been circulating in the population, causing a common cold in immune-related individuals.
These viruses do not require animal deposits.
In contrast, humans with highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV did not adapt well and their transmission to humans cannot be sustained.
They need to grow and thrive in their animal reserves, and possibly find an opportunity to spread to sensitive human targets through one or more medium and spacious host animals.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar properties to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four HCoVs derived from the community.
At least at this point, it is more likely to move like the HCoVs received from the community.
However, it is more pathogenic than the HCoVs received from the community and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether humans will fully adopt it and whether it will circulate in humans without any deposits or intermediate host animals.
Before talking about the origins of HCoVs, it would be better to talk about the evolution of host animals of HCoVs, nature, reserves, medium and wide-ranging determinations, and their characteristics.
An animal, if it has a closely related racial association, acts as an evolutionary host of HCoVs, sharing a high level of similarity at the level of continuity of the nucleotides.
Racial viruses are usually well-motivated and non-pathogenic in this host organism.
Similarly, the host organism provides permanent and long-term protection to HCoVs.
In both cases, host animals are naturally infected and are natural hosts of HCoV or its parent virus.
On the other hand, if HCoV is introduced to the intermediate host at the time of introduction to humans or before, it will not be able to adapt well with the new host and is often a pathogenic.
It can act as an animal source of human infection and then play the role of a host that increases human infection in humans to a large extent.
If the HCoVs intermediate host is unable to maintain the transmission within the organism, it will run into a closed path of infection.
On the other hand, HCoVs can also adapt to the middle host and even establish long-term nutrition.
In this case, the medium host becomes the host of the natural reserves.
The data from the pandemic has revealed with disappointment that the SARS index cases have a history of contact with sports animals.
The investigation into the subsequent outbreak reported that animal dealers had more conflicting SARS-CoV lgG than the general population.
The first cases of SARS-CoV-like viruses were identified in masked palm-sewn cats (Peguoma larvata) and a raccoon dog, which are similar to SARS-CoV.
This indirectly supports the fact that no SARS was reported after all the seot bullets were killed in the markets.
However, it has been reported that mask palm shavings from the forest or fields were largely negative for SARS-CoV without appearing in the live animal market, which suggests that mask palm shavings may be only acting as a wide-ranging medium-sized host, but these are not the natural stockpile of SARS-CoV.
In particular, since the Zhengzhou market contains 80% of the antibody of SARS-CoV in different animals, many small animals with milk cannot be excluded from working as a medium-sized host of SARS-CoV.
All of these appear as closed path hosts of SARS.
As a result of SARS-CoV's natural host animal strain, the closely related bat's CoV, called SARS-related rhinofolios bather CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-Bat CoV HKU3), is present in the Chinese horse-tailed bat.
These bats are positive for the anti-SARS-CoV antibody and the genetic sequence of SARS-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other beta-CoVs share 92-88% nucleoside continuity similarities with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new idea that bats are the hosts of human pathogens.
A number of SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified from bats, but none other than a designated WIV1 can be isolated as a live virus.
Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is called the recipient of SARS-CoV.
The WIV1 obtained from the sample of bats' graces was demonstrated to be used as a receptor of bats, seots, and human ACE2 entry cells.
Interestingly, Sierra's recoverable SARS patients were able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the most closely related SARS-CoV to bats, which share 95 percent of the nucleotide sequence similarities.
Despite the extreme similarity between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not directly the parent virus of SARS-CoV and bats are not hosts of the immediate stockpile of SARS-CoV.
The clusters of MERS-CoV of the same group were analyzed as beta-CoV-HKU4 and beta-CoV-HKU5, a fall gene.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV, the same representative receptor for virus entry, use dipeptyl peptides4 (DPP4).
The RNA polymerase sequences, based on the RNA of MERS identified from Europe and Africa, are genetically closer to their counterparts in beta-CoV.
So far, no live MERS-CoV can be found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closely related beta-CoV-HKU25 share only 87% of nucleotide sequence similarities.
Thus, bats cannot host the immediate reserves of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East found that in a number of African countries, like the Middle East camel, there is a cobalt camel seroposito for the specific inhibitory antibody of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV, similar to the virus found in humans, was isolated by a ruptured camel's nose, and it further indicates that camels serve as the real host animal reserves of MERS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that, experimentally, the camels infected with MERS-CoV had generally mild symptoms, but large-scale virus outbreaks were observed.
In particular, the virus spreads from infected camels not only through the respiratory tract but also through the graceful oral route, which is also the main route of the virus's release from bats.
However, questions remain as there is no date for MERS' confirmed multiple cases to be linked to camels before the onset of symptoms, including human-to-human transmission or the species of unknown animals that shelter MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 is a partner of 96.2 percent nucleotide similarity with the isolated CoV RaT13 beta isolated from the Ranillophos beta.
Like the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, it is great to assign paternity relations between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13.
I mean, beta-SARS-CoV-2 cannot be a host of direct deposits until beta-CoV is found almost identical in the future.
Possibly, Hunan's seafood wholesale market, with many early cases of COVID-19 associated with and potentially signaling a shift from animal to human, will be the host animal between the species of wild animals sold and killed by SARS-CoV-2.
A number of recent studies based on the meta-genetic sequence have suggested that a group of at-risk small mammals known as pangolins (mans javenica) may also be a refuge for native beta coVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
These molecules share the pangolin CoV gene with SARS-CoV-2 in proportion to the %85-92 nucleotide tying sequence.
However, these nucleotide sequences are as closely related to RATG13 with approximately 90% identification at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
These phylogenetic trees have subspecies of subspecies like SARS-CoV-2 viruses, one of which is a %97.4 amino acid with constant identification, as well as sharing with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2.
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, despite the high degree of constant matching genetic range, are more diverse.
In previous studies about the sick pigolin, viral mutations from lung samples, which are similar to those of the relevant SARS-CoV-2, were reported to have been found.
This study has adopted different assembly methods and manual protection, the partial genetic sequence, which is about 86.3% of the viral genes of full length.
We cannot rule out the possibility that penguins are one of the intermediate host animals of SARS-CoV-2.
However, at present, there is no evidence of support for SARS-CoV-2 directly from the source of the pangolin due to the continuity differences between SARS-CoV-2 and the B beta-CoVs of the pangolin SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is also smaller than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and the corresponding BTA CoVs of the pangolin SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 is yet to be established in bats, pangolins, and other dairy animals.
While, the best continuity similarity is found in the resistor binding domain between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 share the best broad genetic continuity similarity.
It is highly speculative that, the selected mediation between SARS-CoV-2 and the relative beta-CoVs of the Pegulin SARS-CoV-2 is driven by careful evolution of the intermediates in the receptor binding domain.
In the third wild animal type, a response has been suggested in favor of reversing the relationship between beta-CoVs and RATG13 related to the pangolin SARA-CoV-2.
The spread of vassal-scale replication between beta CoVs, is present as a driving force in evolution.
A decision on the direct animal source of SARS-CoV-2 is yet to be made.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied to be an animal source.
Genetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may be the original source of beta-CoVs, while ancestral viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in mice.
It has been reported that a beta-CoV terminology in North America's Triangular bat, ARCoV.2 (Eplachin Ridge Cove), has shown a close association with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another beta-CoV terminology hepocydose/ghanavam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, and is also suspected to be a mid-life host on camels.
For explanations, the current knowledge of animal sources of identified HCoVs is summarized in Figures 1 and 2.
Physiological analysis has provided evidence of events of HCoVs being transmitted to mixed species in history.
When domestic livestock HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans around 1890, a global epidemic of respiratory infections was recorded.
The history of the mixed species transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Beta alpha-CoVs have been found to have a close relationship with HCoV-229E.
There is an alpha covalent bond between them.
Several evidence supports the direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, in the shared environmental niche, bats can interact with humans, not alpacas.
Instead, humans are closely related to alpacas.
Second, the HCoV-229E related beta alpha coVs are diverse and non-pathogenic in beta, while the alpha alpha coV is caused by respiratory disease spread in infected animals.
Finally, Alpha Alpha CoV was not found in pets.
In this way, the possibility that Alpacas acquire HCoV-229E-related alpha CoV from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, human pathogenic viruses, including the rabies virus, the Ebola virus, the Nipah virus and the Hendra virus, are the direct source of bats.
So it's not too surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, where beta-alpha CoVs act as a genetic precursor to an HCoV-229E, the alpaca and onion can act as a middle representative just like the cases of MERS-CoV, which transmit the virus to humans.
MERS-CoV works as a perfect example of mixed-inspection transmission from bats to humans with a cobanned camel and camel.
The evolutionary source of MERS-CoV in bats is known as its early identification and is also reinforced by subsequent results.
Obviously, bats provide a rich pool of virus types for the transfer of genetic fragments and inter-communication and the exchange of inter-communications.
Long life, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and strong ability to fly, favorable conditions for bats to become an ideal 'virus spreader'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced into a cow's camel for decades.
It has been well adapted into camels that have been transformed directly from host to host animal of stable and natural reserves.
MERS-CoV maintains very mild disease and relatively low rate mutations in these animals.
Sometimes transmission in humans is an accident, and humans are the closed-loop host of MERS-CoV because they cannot sustain its transmission.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the role of pangolins, if any, is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be closed-loop hosts for SARS-CoV-2B beta-CoV, similar to the seot cats in the SARS-CoV case.
Future studies may include or rule out multiple possibilities of mixed-race transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans.
First, bats can be the source of SARS-CoV-2, which is almost identical to the virus SARS-CoV-2-like host.
Humans share environmental niches with bats through the cultivation of cucumbers or coal mining.
Second, the pangolin may be one of the fastest medium-sized hosts, with SARS-CoV-2 related viruses newly introduced.
Humans get close to the virus by chewing and catching food.
It is possible that a number of dairy animals, including domestic animals, are suffering from SARS-CoV-2.
Antibiotics are guaranteed in domestic and wild animal surveys.
Third, as mentioned above, SARS-CoV-2's recombination and adaptation to both bats and penguins can occur in the third species to interact with.
The search for the animal source of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
In addition to the different types of host animals, CoVs are important in facilitating three major mechanisms by the viral in crossing several types of barriers.
First of all, RNA transcription has a relatively high rate of mutation.
Compared to the second single stranded RNA viruses, the rate of change of COVs can be considered "high" from "moderate" to "moderate" while the average replacement rate per year on each site 2, depending on the phase of adaptation of CoV of the Noel host organisms, is 10-4 as an alternative.
CoVs have pro-readable external bindings, the removal of which results in a much better deformation, attention-grabbing, even incontinence.
Interestingly, the New Clyde analog remdesivir is known to suppress the copy of CoVs by inhibiting this external binding and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is a highly intelligent agent tested as anti-SARA-CoV-2 in medical practice.
However, the rate of variation of CoVs is one million times higher than that of its host animals.
In addition, often times when CoVs cannot adapt well to host animals, it has a higher rate of variation.
Compare the highest mutation rate of SARS-CoV, so apparently the mutation rate in well-adapted SARS-CoV-2 in humans is low.
Probably, it has already been adapted into another host organism near humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to a cobalt camel, is applied.
In theory, it is unlikely that the enlarged genetics will immediately neutralize vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.
Secondly, the genes in CoVs show the use of extra synapses in genetic modification to alter large RNA and replication, thus increasing the likelihood of intergenerational development of mixed species, which is beneficial for the appearance of Novel CoVs when conditions are appropriate.
It is supported by the 3' end of the genome by incorporating a number of unique reading frames and lymphatic functions toward the end of the genome.
Third, through the unique mechanism of "copy selection", CoVs often switch randomly to RNA templates.
During the copying of CoV RNA, in the host organism acting as a mixture, the dor undergoes a frequent change.
The full length of the highly homologous and subgenital RNAs can be reconstructed to produce new CoVs.
Evidence of the natural combination of phylogenetics has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coVs such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
The transmission of the virus to the host
In addition to the above three viral factors, the viral interaction with the host animal recipient is an important factor in effective and mixed species transmission.
Along with this, the recurrence of SARS-CoV is taken as a common example, which gave evidence of positive choice during the mixed-race transition.
In addition to the comparative analysis of the isolation of SARS-CoVs of humans and seots, SARS-CoV is thought to be rapidly diluted in various host organisms, especially with the variation of the S lymphatic receptor binding domain.
In general, the receptor binding domain in the S lymphatic of CoV interacts with the receptor receptor and is strongly selected through the host's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, the resistor binding domain on the S1 fragment is the 318th to 510th amniotic acid, which binds to human ACE2 as well as its corrosives for viral entry.
SARS-CoV's receptor binding domains are able to identify ACE2 receptors that are different animals, including bats, cats, rats, and raccoons, which allow for mixed species transmission of the virus.
In fact, the residues of only 6 amino acids in the resistor binding domain were found to be different in the isolated viral of human and seot cat, 4 of which are found in the form of receptor binding to interact with the receptor of ACE2.
The receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations, which can increase the interaction of the tipper lymph with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acids can prove to be an important substitution for viral adaptation in humans.
It is worth noting, that SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV shares the same respirator.
The difference of 30% between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S lemma indicates that the necessary binding of the S lemma with human ACE2 may change.
Of course, a reversible electrocardiogram study is pointing to this correlation between human ACE 2 and SARS-CoV's S lymphoma being -10 to -20 times higher.
It will also be interesting to determine if another subreceptor will be needed for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also associated with ACE2 but with different parts of S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as amino peptides N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetyl acids for HCoV-OC43.
They can account for the successful adaptation of these CoVs after the mixed species transfer from their host animal to humans.
In addition to cellular receptors, HCoV is the result of mixed species transmission monitoring, relying on another host organism and through binding factors.
The spread of these host lymph nodes between humans and host animals with natural reserves of HCoVs, such as bats, a mountainous camel, and rats, can hinder mixed species transmission.
In HCoVs, a successful mixed species transfer involves the dependence factors of the angry host organism and the binding factors of the disruptive host organism.
In this regard, the molecular identification and characteristics of this important part of the interaction with the host organism of the virus are yet to be determined.
A comprehensive genetic testing of host-dependent and binding factors for SARS-CoV-2 may benefit from the use of CRISPR's latest technology.
New HCoVs: Back to the Ground Zero
The diversity of beta-CoV provides plenty of opportunities for the elimination of novel HCoVs.
In this respect, beta-CoVs act as a gene pool of an HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic replication also increase the development of HCoVs and act as two important steps in the process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of a novel lymphatic coding gene has the potential to rapidly change the phenotype of the viral.
In the supporting lymphocytes of SARS-CoV, ORF8 is considered important in the adaptation of humans, as SARS-CoV-related beta viruses were isolated but found to have different ORF8 antibodies.
The strains that have been isolated since the beginning of the human epidemic have been identified as the end of 29 nucleotides of SARS-CoV.
This deletion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and it is an adaptive variable that promotes transfer to host organisms.
In addition, there is a history of possible recombination with the sequence of alpha- and gamma-CoVs of SARS-CoV, where a large number of recombinant RNA polymerases depending on RNA were identified.
Retinal sites were identified in parts of nsp9, mostly nsp10, and nsp14.
Similarly, it has also been observed that the MERS-CoV epidemic, which took place in a mountainous camel in Saudi Arabia, has had to experience recurrence incidents between different rodents.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been seen in other CoVs, with HCoVs recombining with other animal coVs with their non-communicable genes.
It should also be cautioned that artificial selection may contribute to undesirable changes in viral genes, possibly avoiding selective pressure, such as the host's immune system, resulting in immunity from the virus.
An example of its effects is the loss of the entire length of ORF4 in the Prototype Steroid of HCoV-229 E, causing two nucleotides to be removed.
Although the presence of ORF4 in bats and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E may be observed, the alpha alpha-CoV exhibits a single neo-climatic mutation, resulting in a frame shift.
Last but not least, the evolution of novel HCoVs is also driven by selective pressure in the host organisms of their deposits.
When bats are infected with CoVs, there is an unexplained symptom or mild symptom, which indicates a correlation between CoVs and bats.
It appears that bats have good compatibility with anatomically and physically with CoVs.
For example, defects in activating an anti-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the kinetic pathology through CoVs.
In addition, natural killer cell receptors that inhibit the activity of natural killer cells in bats are suppressed due to low levels of exposure to NKG2/CD94 and large histochemical complexes Class I.
Furthermore, reactivating the high level of oxygen type produced by the high metabolic activity of bats (ROS) by suppressing the copying of both CoVs, and effecting proof readings through <0x58>-rays to create highly pathogenic virus strains, when a new host is introduced, provides a selective suppression.
Further pathogenic CoV strains may develop through reabsorption, which may increase the properties of nodules or laxatives to accommodate host animal adaptations.
Therefore, it is not agreed that three novel HCoVs emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs cause non-pathogenic or mild symptoms in their reserve host animals such as bats and camels.
They reproduce strongly without the immune response of the powerful host organism.
In this, the secrets of why non-significant pathogens are shown and the cause of severe cases in human infections are hidden.
Severe symptoms are mainly caused by the hyperactivity of the immune response and the cytokine Strom in which, from a powerful immune response, more intensely damage the lungs.
In contrast, in a non-significant disease, the immune response has been de-coupled from the copy of CoV.
The same strategy of non-coherent immune response has a beneficial effect in the treatment of anti-SARA-CoV-2.
The reaction of the interferon is particularly powerful in bats.
Therefore, the organization of type I interferon should be beneficial at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, the inflammation of NLRP3 in bats is defective.
For this reason, prevention of NLRP3 inflammation in the treatment of COVID-19 may be beneficial to do with MCC950.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general idea of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Where a bat bat bat has been found to share a %95 nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV, there is a beta-CoV that is sharing a %96 nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV-2.
While seots and other animals in the market have been found to harbor viruses such as SARS-CoV, the direct intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 has not been identified.
Pangolin Beta CoVs have been found to be homologous to SARS-CoV-2, which means that pangolins are acting as one of the intermediate host animals or that the pangolin Beta-CoVs can be inserted into the final version of SARS-CoV-2 through genetic fragments.
Although the questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 has been intentionally or accidentally created by humans.
Due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, CoVs have come back to light.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has radically changed our views on animal sources and animal reserves of HCoVs in human transmission.
Extensive evidence suggests that the source of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is bats and that it has been transmitted to humans through a medium host animal.
Given that SARS-CoV infection is caused by contact between humans and citrus in the markets, the SARS epidemic can be effectively eliminated by closing meat markets and killing citrus.
For this reason, in view of the discovery of numerous clusters of pangolin beta-CoVs closely associated with SARS-CoV-2, pangolins should be removed from meat markets to prevent transmission from animals.
However, future investigations have yet to explain when and where SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other dairy animals.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in a mountainous camel for a long time.
For locals, these camels serve as the main source of meat, milk, leather, and wool, as well as an important means of transportation.
They are widely found in the Middle East and Africa.
So to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, just like what was done in China's markets, it is impossible to sacrifice all the camels to control MERS.
To prevent the recent spread of MERS, along with other measures to control infection, a sensible approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS for camels.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, these can lead to the emergence of new genetic variants.
In the wild, species of animal coVs are circulating.
In particular, bat CoVs are very diverse with the ability in animals.
As a result of the emissions of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or fatal in humans in the future, there are many opportunities for animal CoVs to develop and re-occur.
To reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, wild animals should abandon the culture of food in some places in China.
With the trials of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, the plan for better preparedness and response should be in place.
In fact, there have been many viruses on the planet for a long time.
They live in their natural reserves until they have a chance to grow.
Although bats have many characteristics that cause the spread of viruses, if people are educated, chances of contact with human bats and other wildlife species can be reduced.
For a better understanding of CoV and its natural hosts, continuous monitoring of breastfeeding animals is essential, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of the disease from animals to humans and its future spread.
As a result, by avoiding the environmental degradation of the natural reserves of viruses transmitted from animals to humans, the virus from animals to humans can be more effectively prevented.
Several pieces of the puzzle of being the source animal of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if a bat transmits an ethnic virus of SARS-CoV-2 to the pangolin, it will be interesting to see that bats and pangolins can share the same environmental force in the same conditions.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it should determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if the third feeding animal acts as a real intermediate representative, it must explain how it interacts with other species, including humans, bats, and penguins.
Finally, because many other breast-feeding animals, including domestic animals, can be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both their monitoring and experiments should be conducted for infection.
If bats, pangolins, or any other dairy animals are, it is expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 and its parent virus, which are almost identical, will be identified in its natural representatives.
The continuation of the investigation in this field will explain the evolutionary journey of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, along with having a significant impact on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
The diagnostic criteria for the "suspected case" and "confirmed case" of COVID-19 must be updated.
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick advisory guide for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, this guide provides our experience and is a good reference for fighting the global pandemic.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, based on our ongoing research results in awareness and knowledge and clinical practice experience, it is steadily increasing; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we respond to a comment on our guidance, which has been issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China, saying that we provide the latest diagnostic standards for the "suspected case" and "confirmed case" as per the final guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (the seventh version).
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) spread, which has now been officially called the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus has been called severe respiratory distress coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
To fight against SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a rapid consultation guide and it has been published online in Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
It received more attention after the publication.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease, based on the results of ongoing research in our awareness and knowledge and clinical practice experience, it is gradually increasing; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China issued the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), its total of seven issues from January 16, 2020 to March 3, 2020, with some fundamental changes being made in the context of which.
Now that our guide has received a comment from Zhao et al., he has suggested easy scoring based on his medical experience.
His work added new evidence for our guidance and is a valuable reference for this pandemic around the world.
We are grateful to them for their excellent work.
However, their work also needs to be updated in accordance with the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (the seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh issue (3 March 2020), a comprehensive analysis is needed to confirm the suspected case by combining one of two items of medical clarification with one of the features of the epidemic history, or three items of medical specifications without a clear date of the outbreak:
A history of infectious diseases: (1) the history of travel or residence in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where symptoms of COVID-19 have been reported in the past 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms such as symptoms in the first 2 days of the symptoms of COVID-19; (2) the history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive diagnosis of the second day of the SARS-CoV-2); (3) the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas.
Medical Specifications: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with imaginative characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) the number of white blood cells in the early onset stage shows normal, drowsy, or low lymphocyte count.
Pathogenesis or serological evidence should be evaluated to have a confirmed case of suspected cases with one of the following items: (1) to be a positive of the anti-corrosive antigen test in real-time for SARS-CoV-2; (2) to be a positive of the anti-corrosive anti-corrosion test of the known novel coronaviruses; (3) to test the entire viral gene in serum.
We can see that real-time PCR testing for nucleic acid in respiratory tract or blood samples was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) counts.
Pathogen detection in blood samples was included in the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020); and serological evidence was included in the seventh issue.
The research-based modification work is ongoing to find more nucleic acid detection kits to quickly diagnose the confirmed quality, as well as to take samples of the respiratory tract, including blood, that increase the availability of different samples, and help in bringing positive results to the specific antibody.
In addition, there is also a lot of evidence that reminds us of caution from patients with traditional symptoms and without symptoms.
Therefore, Zhou et al.'s Baha'u'llah chart should be refreshed, as they have classified the individual as "low risk" without medical symptoms.
The score system also needs to be confirmed in further medical practice and studies.
As a result, we expect more direct evidence to come and give our feedback to readers.
For the diagnosis of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases," we advise them to track and comply with the latest guidelines in their home countries.
In order to provide support, our team keeps up-to-date on our guidance.
Bangladesh has reported five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest daily.
Bangladesh has confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day due to the virus.
As of yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemic Diseases, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), said the number of recorded cases includes 114 active cases and 33 recoveries that remain at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
Explaining the details in an online news, IEDCR Director Dr. Merjedi Sabrina Flora said that four men and a woman were among the dead.
According to Dr. Mir Jedi, two cases were over 60 years of age, two between 51 and 60 years of age, and one between 41 and 50 years of age.
He also said that two of the dead were from Dhaka.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
A hospital official told the Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saif-ur-Rehman, the director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Bureau, who was taken care of at Merry Hospital in Kuwait.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh Road Transport and Bridge Minister Obaid al-Qadri said public transport would be closed for a long time from this coming week under the initial plan.
Initially, the closure of public transport began on March 26 and was planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of essential goods -- medical supplies, fuel and food -- was still allowed.
On March 8, the first cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded in two people who had returned from Italy and the wife of one of them.
By 19 March, all three had already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has surpassed one million infections globally.
On Thursday, data from Johns Hopkins University indicated that the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection globally has exceeded one million.
About 52,000 deaths are linked to COVID-19, a disease that appears to be related to the coronavirus.
The milestone came the same day Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and the first death related to the coronavirus in Zambia.
As of Thursday, North Korea has claimed that it is one of the few countries that have so far been free of coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases, at 10 a.m. Central Europe time (8800 UTC) on April 4.
linked to 5,900 deaths in the United States, more than 244,000 coronavirus cases were recorded.
CBS News, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, reported that as of Wednesday, more than 1,000 U.S. deaths had been caused by coronavirus infections.
Across the world, countries have announced strict measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow's mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, extended the city's lock-down until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that payments to the Russians would continue until April 30 without working.
Portugal's parliament voted in favor of a 15-day extension of the national emergency, with 215 votes in favor, 10 reshuffles, and one vote against it.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for a full day: earlier, the curfew was effective from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand will impose a curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor, Mike Dwayne, announced that the state had extended its stay at home order until May 1.
Reduced the range of toilet tissue paper in Australia's stores in every transaction
On Sundays and Saturdays, Australian stores chains Wal-Wallworth and Quills reduced the purchase restrictions of toilet tissue paper in all stores nationwide to two on each transaction and one pack.
Aldi also introduced Monday, the range of a pack.
These limits were posted as messages on checkouts, and the chain's face-back pages.
Due to the fear of COVID-19, it was reported to have been stored by buyers in the event of a need for people's self-isolation.
On Wednesday, Woolworth also restricted the purchase of toilet tissue paper for delivery at home to one pack per order.
These changes followed the four-pack restrictions on each transaction introduced by Woolworth and Quills on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Quills, in a media release on March 8, stated that with a ban of four packs in one place, "many stores are still selling within an hour of delivery," and that demand was termed "unprecedented," while ALDI said in a Facebook post on Tuesday, calling it "unexpected."
According to Woolworth's spokesman, last week's sales "increased tremendously."
Costco's store in Canberra also restricted last week's allowed number to two packs.
In order to reduce the shortage, Quills ordered larger packets from the supply providers and increased the frequency of delivery, Woolworth ordered additional storage, while ADLI stored for special initial availability on the planned Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers try to increase storage, but the ban on delivery truck timings by the local council has made it difficult.
They are in addition to increased production costs, because suppliers try to meet demand and do something special.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after a storage discount, some stores may not run on specific Wednesdays.
Dr. Gary Martyr, a retail expert at the University of Queensland of Technology, said in a report on News.com.au that stores fill stores daily at night.
He said the toilet tissue paper is a big thing, due to which it has a small amount of storage, and, when sold, leaves the vast space of the shelf empty, which gives a feeling of severe shortage.
Russell Zimmerman said in ABC News, "Quils and Woolworth are reviewed [that] if there are a lot of things on the shelf, if products like toilets and sanitizers can go [purchase], and if they are in quantity, maybe you can reduce anxiety."
The tissue paper maker of a crepe-giving recycled toilet said on Wednesday that they would be without storage.
According to News.com.au report, Camberly Clark, who makes the tissues of the clarinet toilet, and Solars who make the sorbent, insisted that they were working 24/7 to maintain the supply.
Domain.com, a site for the purchase and sale of property, said that some of the property sellers in Melbourne offer free toilet tissue paper to the first bidder at the auction, some auctions were held when buyers had time due to the long weekend on the occasion of Workers' Day.
The NT News Thursday issue, which was covered in the daily Darwin, included eight-page transcripts, meaning they should be cut and used as toilet tissue paper.
According to an ABC Australia report on March 3, the stores were actually reluctant to impose the restrictions, which they said had no plans to introduce a ban on their purchases.
Russell Zimmerman also said that the demand for other products, including masks, sanitizers, dry items, hand washers and flour, is also high.
Similarly, on Sunday evening, outside Australia, the purchase of the British supermarket was observed to be limited to a pack of two to 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the ongoing spread of COVID-19 — a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 — is a global epidemic.
Although the term "diabetic disease" refers to the rapid spread of a disease, not to how dangerous certain cases are, the World Health Organization stressed the need for governments to act.
All countries can change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize their people in response.
We are most concerned about the two dimensions of the disease due to its first degree of acceleration and severity and the alarming extent of action against it.
According to Dr. Tom Friedan, the former director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented."
"In addition to influenza, no other respiratory virus has been detected since the onset of the pandemic," he said in a statement published in CNN in February.
Ghebreyesus said: "We have never seen a global pandemic that has been precipitated by the coronavirus."
"We have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time," he continued.
The new status of the pandemic came after the World Health Organization declared the pandemic a public health emergency of international concern in January.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the United States, said of the outbreak, "The important thing is that it's heading towards further destruction."
The Associated Press reported that as of Thursday, the number of COVID-19 patients in the world had reached 126,000, resulting in 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is a variant of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which is responsible for severe respiratory illness coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China on December 2019, and on January 30, 2020, international concern was declared as a public health emergency, and on March 11, 2020, it was identified as a global epidemic.
As of April 10, 2020, about 1.61 million COVID-19 patients were reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in about 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
China's fatality rate has been estimated at 4%, while globally it reaches from 13.0% in Algeria to 88% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Complications can include symptoms of pneumonia and severe difficulty in breathing.
The duration from the onset of the disease to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to four days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Early treatment is symptomatic and supportive treatment. Suggested precautions include coughing, coughing and sneezing, distance from other people, and monitoring and treatment for people who suspect they are infected.
Authorities around the world have also advocated travel restrictions, quarantine, enforcement of curfews, controlling risk in the workplace, and enforcing the closure of facilities.
The pandemic disrupted many global social economy, postponed religious, political and charitable events, and led to a massive shortage of goods due to poor procurement.
Schools and universities in 193 countries were either closed at the national level or at the local level, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world's population.
Misunderstandings about the virus surfaced online and there have been instances of discrimination and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of color and race in East and South East Asia, and those where the virus has been reported to have more and more cases.
Due to low traffic and the closure of large industries, air pollution and carbon emissions have been reduced.
Health authorities in the Chinese city of Wuhan, Hubei province, reported a collection of pneumonia cases for an unknown reason on December 31, 2019, and a study was launched in early January 2020.
Most of these cases are related to the Hunan Seafood wholesale market, which is why it is believed that the virus belongs to the genus of animal diseases.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that was not closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. The first person to be diagnosed with the disease was a patient on December 1, 2019.
Two-thirds of the initial cases reported in December 2019 were from markets.
On March 13, 2020, the South China Morning Post recommended in an unconfirmed report that the incident of a 55-year-old man in Hobby Province on November 17, 2019 may be the first - the World Health Organization reported on February 26, 2020 that although China is decreasing, the number of new cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea has increased dramatically, with the number of new cases rising in the first time.
It is also possible that the number of cases may be low, especially in people with common symptoms of the disease.
On February 26, relatively few cases of young people aged 19 and under were reported, accounting for 2.4% of global cases, according to the UK's chief scientific adviser Patrick Villanus, who estimated that 60% of the UK's population would be affected before becoming an effective crowd.
According to the official protocol, the number of cases refers to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and have been confirmed to be positive.
As of March 23, no country had tested 3% of its population, and many countries had a government policy that only those with mild symptoms should not be tested, as in Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 revealed that in China, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 patients were unrecognized until January 23, and that unregistered patients were the source of infection in 79% of registered patients.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infected infections in Italy was significantly higher than the reported cases.
For COVID-19, the primary re-estimation number (R0) is 1.4 to 2.4.
The study, published by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most of the people infected with COVID-19 have recovered.
For those who do not, the duration from the onset of symptoms of the disease to death is 6 to 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, about 97,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
As of February 5, nearly 80% of the deaths in China were in people over 60 years of age and 75% had pre-existing diseases, including heart disease and the official number of deaths from the sugar-COVID-19 pandemic usually comprised of those who tested positive for COVID-19, according to official protocols.
The exact number of deaths from COVID-19 can be many, as those deaths do not include people who die without a test - for example at home, in a nursing home, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic was higher than the official death toll from COVID-19 at x4-5.
A spokesman for the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that "we know [the number of reported deaths] is reported to be low," confirming reports that the number of deaths in the U.S. is low.
The first death outside mainland China occurred in the Philippines on February 1, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
As of February 28, more than a dozen deaths, outside of central China, have occurred in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of March 13, more than 40 countries and territories reported deaths from each continent, except for the Pacific South. A number of joint measures are used to determine deaths.
These numbers vary by region and time, and are affected by testing, treatment system quality, treatment options, time after the initial outbreak of the pandemic, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health.
Based on the data from Johns Hopkins University, the global mortality and incidence ratio is 6.0% as of April 10, 2020 (97,039/1,617,204).
The number varies by region.
The proportion of cases and deaths in China (from the onset of symptoms of the disease to the onset of symptoms) has declined from 17.3% to 0.7% (from the onset of the disease to the onset of the disease) - the other measures include the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) which shows the percentage of people diagnosed with the disease, and the number of deaths from the infection.
These numbers are not for a specific period of time, and are for a particular population, from infection to the final solution of the matter.
Many experts have tried to count this number for a particular population.
Oxford University's Center for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the overall mortality rate from infection in the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper limit of this estimate is consistent with a statistical study analyzing the results of the first miscellaneous tests of COVID-19 carried out in Germany, and the effects of testing on CFR estimates.
The WHO says the pandemic can be controlled.
The rise and final period of the pandemic are different and uncertain in terms of location.
"If it is not detected, the multiple spread usually increases like the surface and then begins to come down when the disease is no longer found," said McKenzie Bonnie of Penn State University.
But it's impossible to say when this will happen, at the moment a reasonable plan will be made."
Zhong Nanshan, China's top medical adviser, stressed that "it could end by June" if all countries were urged by the World Health Organization to follow its advice on measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Charsky, Adam of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told the BBC that SARS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate consistently for a year or two."
According to a study by the Imperial College, led by Neil Ferguson, distance from one another and other measures will be needed "until a vaccine is available (consistently 18 months or more)."
"I don't think it's likely that this coronavirus — completely eradicated — will cause it's easily transmissible," said William Schaeffer of Vanderbilt University, and that it will "turn into a seasonal disease, and come back every year."
The loss of return will depend on the extent of the reduction of the African crowd and its transmigration.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively inconclusive and those affected may be without symptoms.
Two common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include a stroke, a bulge in the throat (bulge), loss of ability to breathe, shortness of breath, pain in the joints and joints, sore throat, headaches, colds, coughs, coughing, coughing, and almost any other illness.
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) adds to the list of emergency symptoms: shortness of breath, constant pain or pressure in the chest, sudden aches, difficulty waking up, and facial or lip naps; if these symptoms are present, it is recommended to seek immediate medical attention.
Some of these infected people may be without symptoms, they may be able to pass the confirmed patient test results without medical symptoms, so the researchers have issued a recommendation that people who have been in contact with confirmed patients should be closely monitored and tested to avoid infection.
China's unexplained symptoms range from a few numbers to 44%.
The incubation period usually covers one to 14 days; it is usually five days. For example, the cessation of smelling in people with COVID-19<0x2B> was initially 30%, which later decreased to 15%.
Some of the details of the disease are still being worked out.
The disease is thought to be initially caused by close relationships and from the small droplets that occur when coughing, sneezing, or speaking; where the distance in close contact is 1 or 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that droplets can range from 4.5 m (15 ft) to 8.2 m (27 ft) without dahnpe.
Some people have suggested that the virus can also be transmitted by small droplets that stay in the air for longer periods of time that are formed while speaking. Respiratory droplets can also occur while exhaling, including during conversations, although the virus is not usually in the air.
These droplets can enter the mouth or nose of nearby people or possibly enter the lungs when they are breathing.
Some medical practices, such as inhaling the breath through the mouth in an artificial way (CPR) can bring out the respiratory tract and thus it can flow into the air.
It can also occur when an infected person touches the surface and then touches the eye, nose or mouth.
Although there are concerns that it can be removed from the face, the risk is considered very low.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through the body's excreted material, which is highly contagious for three days before the onset of symptoms, although its spread is possible before symptoms and in the final stages of the disease.
Since people's test can be positive up to three days before the onset of symptoms, it is believed that the transmission of the disease is possible even before the appearance of effective symptoms.
Only a few confirmed cases have been reported from the laboratory where there are no symptoms of the disease, but some countries have detected no symptoms during the investigation of contacts.
The European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) states that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease can spread, one person can usually infect two to three people - the virus can survive for hours to days at different levels.
In particular, the virus was detected on plaster (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for three days, on cardboard for a day, and on copper for four hours.
However, the duration varies in humidity and temperature, and the COVID-19 test has been positive in pets and other animals.
There is no evidence that the virus can be transmitted from animals to humans, even though British authorities advise handwashing after contact with animals, such as when contacting other surfaces that have been touched by infected people.
Severe respiratory symptoms coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, previously isolated from three people suffering from pneumonia who are associated with a group of acute respiratory illness in the city of Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the respective physical coronaviruses - outside the human body, the virus can be eliminated from the ghrelo-sab, which dissolves its protective shell.
It is believed to be caused by animal diseases.
Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus, as a hereditary, is associated with the family of the genus B. Tacoronavirus, with two tannins of Chamgader in the Feri lineage.
At the overall genome level, it resembles 96% of the other bat coronavirus pneumonia (BatCoV RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that human and pangolin viruses contain only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the genome chain.
Comparing the complete genome to date, it has been found that 92% of the genetic material is often shared in the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is enough to prove that pangolins are the average host of the virus.
Temporary diagnosis of infection with the virus can be based on the symptoms of the disease, although confirmed by infected fluids or ICT <0x58>-rays is ultimately confirmed through reverse transcription polymers chain reaction (RRT-PCR).
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan showed that CT is less specific but significantly more sensitive than PCR, although its antigen properties cover other pneumonia and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the U.S. College of Radiology recommends that CT should not be used for screens or as the first clinical trial to diagnose COVID-19.
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.
The test uses reverse transcription polymers chain reaction (RRT-PCR).
This test is performed on the respiratory tract or blood sample.
Its results are usually available from a few hours to days.
Usually, this test is done through infinity cotton, although cotton can also be used in the throat - several labs and companies are also undergoing cross-examination, which detects antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of them has been proven to be quite accurate so that it can be approved for mass use.
In the United States, a serological test has been developed by Selex, which has been approved for emergency use only in authorized laboratories.
Characterized by their reflection on radiographs and computed tomography (CTs), which show symptoms of the disease, isometric peripheral ground glass opiates and excessive flow.
The Italian Radiology Society is creating an international online database of photographic results of Certified Events.
Due to the overlapping of other infections such as the adenovirus, the identification of COVID-19 imaging without PCR verification is of limited character.
A major study in China compared chest CT results with PCR, which showed that although imaging for infection is of low quality, it is faster and more sensitive, with the suggestion that it should be considered as a screening device in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based neural networks were created to detect both radiography and CT features of the virus.
Prevention strategies include maintaining a high level of personal hygiene as a whole, wiping the hands, wiping the eyes, nose or mouth with no hands, and coughing and sneezing in the tissues, and sneezing and sneezing the tissues.
Those who are already infected with the infection are advised to wear a surgical mask in public places.
Measures to prevent the spread of the disease are also suggested - many countries have restricted travel or have restricted non-essential travel from other countries or have prohibited travel to regions that are affected by the pandemic.
However, the virus has reached the stage of spreading to the community in large part of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within society and some community members do not know how and where they have been infected - health care workers, who are at risk of being infected with the disease, are advised to stay in touch and seek out more preventive measures to protect their eyes.
Concerns have been raised by governments over the use of the Occasion Palace data by mobile phones for this purpose, Amnesty International and 100 other organizations have issued a statement asking to limit such surveillance.
As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups have been working on a privacy-friendly solution, such as using Bluetooth to get the user's opportunity palace from another mobile.
The user then receives a message if he or she has been close to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misunderstandings are circulating in the prevention of infection; for example, pouring water into the nose and drowning with the dead wash are not effective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, but many organizations are working on the development of one.
It is recommended to wash your hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC advises people to wash their hands frequently with soap for twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands are obviously dry; before washing; and when cleaning their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by guarillo soap when its protective shell is blown off.
The CDC recommends the use of a more alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol by volume, when soap and water are not available.
The World Health Organization advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth without touching their hands.
The surfaces should also be purified in several ways (stainless steel levels should be held for one minute in front of an germ), including %62-71 ethanol, %50-100 sopranos, %0.1 sodium hypochlorite, %0.5 hydrogen peroxide and 0.2 to %7.5 ion.
Other methods, such as benzalconium chloride and crohexedric gluconate are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a suspected or confirmed COVID case appears at a location, such as an office or nursery, all areas such as office, toilet, joint space, joint electrical equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote control, ATM machines, which are used by sick people, should be disinfected.
Health organizations have recommended that people cover their mouths with a stick or tissue and immediately destroy such tissues.
Wearing a surgical mask is recommended for those who may be affected, because wearing a mask limits both the size and distance of the droplets emitted by the person affected, when he speaks, coughs and coughs.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidelines on when and how to wear a mask.
According to Stephen Griffin, an expert at the University of Leeds, " Wearing a mask may reduce people's chances of touching their faces, which is a major source of infection if left untreated."
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends wearing masks for healthy people only if their health is at high risk, as if they are seeing a COVID-19 patient, even though they admit that wearing a face mask prevents people from touching their faces.
Many countries have started encouraging people to wear face masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing non-medical face masks made of cloth - China has specifically suggested that healthy people in public use disposable medical masks, especially when they are likely to go near other people (1 meter (3 feet) or less.
Hong Kong recommends using public transport sources or wearing surgical masks while staying in crowded places.
Thailand's health authorities are encouraging people to wear masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from entering the country without wearing a mask or using their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam urged everyone to wear a face mask while in public to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory for everyone to wear a mask when entering the shops.
Israel has asked all residents to wear a face mask when entering public spaces.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million masks per day since mid-March, also requires passengers to wear masks in buses running between rail cars and cities from April 1.
In Panama, it is mandatory to wear a face mask while going out of the house, while at home, it is also advised to prepare masks for those who are not able to afford to buy masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes acts of disease control aimed at reducing the spread of infection by limiting close contact between individuals.
These methods include quarantine, travel restrictions, closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, cinemas, or shopping centers.
Individuals can apply social distancing practices while staying at home, avoiding going to the gym, not receiving congratulatory messages, and physically distancing from each other.
Many governments are implementing or advising social distancing in areas affected by the pandemic.
The maximum number of people recommended by U.S. government institutions and health organizations was quickly reduced to 50 from 250 people (where there is no known case of COVID-19 in the area), which was later reduced to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people, including older people and those who are in a chronic health condition, such as those who have been diagnosed with the condition of the heart, respiratory disease, high blood pressure and weakened immune system.
The term social distancing began to draw the impression that they should be completely isolated from the world rather than encouraged to interact with other people in alternative ways.
They also recommend that you only have sex with your partner who does not have any symptoms of the virus or the virus.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for people who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and who are in doubt that they are infected.
Health institutions have issued detailed guidelines for proper self-isolation, and many governments have mandated or suggested the entire population living in an affected area to go into self-quarantine.
The strictest guidelines of self-quarantine have been issued for those who are in a serious danger group.
Those who have come in contact with a COVID-19 patient and those who have recently travelled to a country or region where it is widespread have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days with the last possible outbreak.
Prevention, control, or pressure and mitigation are strategies to control an epidemic.
The containment strategy is formulated in the early stages of the pandemic and aims to identify and isolate infected people, introduce other infection control measures and vaccinate them to prevent the disease from spreading to other people in the population.
When it is not possible to prevent the disease from spreading further, then the effort is entered into the phase of mitigation: measures are put in place to reduce its prevalence and its impact on the health care system and society.
Measures for prevention and mitigation of effects, both should be put together at the same time.
To contain the pandemic, more stringent measures need to be put in place to reduce the spread of the pandemic from 1 to less than the primary outbreak of the pandemic. Part of the management of the infectious disease is to try to reduce the rise of the pandemic, which is called sagging the outbreak.
This reduces the risk of health services being overwhelmed, and provides more time for vaccine development and treatment.
Non-communicable measures that can manage the outbreak include preventive measures, such as stricter measures such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-reporting measures such as stricter travel restrictions, as well as stricter quarantines, as well as social distancing measures, such as the closure of schools and the cancellation of mass gatherings, and the inclusion of communities that encourage people to do so.
Other countries have adopted a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea has made large-scale screenings and quarantines locally and continues to monitor the movement of those affected.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those affected who quarantined themselves and imposed fines on those who did not.
In Taiwan, the production of face masks and authorized storage of medical supplies has increased, and the similarities between the United Kingdom and the United States show that mitigation (decreased prevalence but not ending) and pressure (increased global epidemic) are major challenges.
More and more mitigation policies can bring the rise in demand to 2/3 and the death rate to half, but at the same time, hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems can be overcome.
Pressure can be prioritized as a transition, but it should continue as long as the virus continues to circulate in the human population (or as long as a vaccine is available, if it is first) otherwise it quickly returns to health when measures are relaxed.
Long-term interventions to suppress the global pandemic lead to social and economic costs.
There is no specific antiviral drug approved for COVID-19, but efforts are underway to develop it, including experiments on existing medicines.
The use of anti-cold medicines, drinking more water and rest can help alleviate the symptoms of the disease.
Depending on the severity of the disease, it may be necessary to apply oxygen, get a vaccine in the vein and help in breathing.
The use of steroids can worsen the results.
Many of the compounds that have previously been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being researched for the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has also said that "some traditional and gastrointestinal tracts" can provide relief in SARS-CoV-19 diseases.
The increase in capacity and adaptability of health care providers to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients has been described by the World Health Organization as a key step in responding to the pandemic.
The ECDC and the World Health Organization's Regional European Union Office have issued guidelines for resource change at various stages for hospitals and primary health centres, including focusing on laboratory services on the ability to test COVID-19, while eliminating the number of optional beds and beds available, isolation and isolation of COVID-19 positive patients and extreme personnel training.
There are many theories as to where the first event (i.e. zero patient) started.
The first case of novel coronavirus was reported on December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hobby began to increase gradually.
Most of these cases are attributed to the wholesale seafood market in Hunan, where live animals are also sold, and there is a theory that the virus came from this type of animal; in other words, the virus was reported to be from the genus of zoonotic diseases.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Central Wuhan Hospital warned their colleagues about "SARS-like coronavirus."

On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus, several U.S. stock indices, including the Nasdaq-100, the S&P 500 Andyx, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, saw their sharpest decline since 2008, with the Dow dropping 1,191 points, the biggest one-day fall since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
All three indexes saw a decline of more than 10% at the end of the week.
On February 28, Scoop Rating GmbH confirmed China's own credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
Stock markets fell again due to fears of the coronavirus, the biggest fall was on March 16.
Many people think that there is a possibility of economic recession.
Economist Muhammad L. Erin praised the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and states.
The central bank is reacting more quickly than the financial crash of 2008.
Travel restrictions, the closure of public places, including tourist centers, and tourism is one of the most affected suspicions due to travel restrictions imposed by governments globally.
As a result, a number of airlines, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Cantas, cancelled flights due to low demand, while British carrier Flyby also crashed.
The maritime tourism industry had a never-before-seen impact.
Several railway stations and ports have also been closed.
The outbreak came at a time with Chonyan, a major travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holidays.
A number of events, most of them attended, were cancelled by national and regional governments, including an annual New Year's celebration, in which private companies closed their shops and tourist centers, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Several Lunar Year events and tourist centers, including the Forbidden City and traditional dome fairs in Beijing, were closed to avoid crowds.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipal and regional officials extended New Year's holidays until February 10, and directed most workplaces not to reopen until this date.
These regions represented 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong raised the level of response to the infectious disease to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, under which schools were closed until March and New Year's celebrations were canceled.
Access to retail stores in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Retail sales in North America and the Middle East declined by 50-60%.
This led to a 33-43% drop in pedestrians to shopping centres in March compared to February.
World-wide shopping malls have implemented additional measures, such as additional cleaning, installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of buyers, and cancellation of events. According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the global pandemic could lead to 14 to 22 million more people in Latin America without extreme poverty.
In January and February 2020, when the epidemic peaked in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China had lost their jobs.
China's nearly 300 million rural migrants have fled their homes in remote areas of the provinces or moved to Hubei province, where more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs in March 2020 and have applied for government assistance.
According to an estimate by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, coronavirus disease in the U.S. could cause 47 million losses and the unemployment rate could reach 32%. Thousands of workers (day-to-day wage earners) in India have become unemployed.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for the Universal Credit Scheme.In Germany, nearly half a million companies also offered their workers a short-term job scheme called Coorsbyt.
France and the UK have also adopted a compensation scheme for Germany's short-term work.
Globally, the fields of arts and cultural heritage have been severely affected by the pandemic, which has also impacted the actions of individuals with institutions—both job creation and autonomy.
Organizations in the field of arts and culture strive to maintain their mission (often with public support) to provide access to the cultural heritage of society, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and help artists as much as possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, artifacts and other cultural institutions in different directions around the world were closed indefinitely and their exhibitions, events and events were cancelled or postponed.
Another recent and sharpest setback to the disease is the cancellation of religious services, key events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican announced that the Happy Week in Rome, which falls in the last week of the Christian Lent season, was canceled.
Many priests advised older Christians to stay at home instead of attending Sunday prayers; some churches began broadcasting church services via radio, direct TV, or online, while others were in a car.
As Roman Catholic priests in Rome closed down their churches and choirs, and St. Peter's Square was vacated by Christian visitors, other religious institutions also closed their services and restricted public gatherings in churches, mosques, casinos, temples and squares.
Iran's health ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the pandemic, while Saudi Arabia closed the entry of foreign visitors and similarly the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
This pandemic, since World War II, has caused significant disruption to the world's sporting calendar.
Major sporting events, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, 2019-20 NBA, and 2019-20 NHL sessions, have been canceled or postponed.
The outbreak has disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the activity "will be rescheduled from March 24, 2020 onwards, but will not be held after the summer of 2021."
That's why many gamblers have moved online, and there has been a significant increase in the new sign-ups of many online gambling sites. The entertainment industry has also been particularly affected, many music groups have postponed or disrupted their concert tours.
Many big theaters, such as those on Broadway, have also suspended all performances.
Many fans have found ways to work on the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as the live streaming event, and bring it to others, or keep creating a web-based "meal" so that fans can perform, spread it, and advertise their work.
Online, many memes based on the idea of coronavirus have spread because many turn to humor and distraction in this uncertain situation.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, towards the Chinese and East Asian people, Europe, the United States and other countries where the outbreak showed severity, there has been a lot of discrimination, xenophobia, fear and racism from strangers.
There have been incidents of fear, suspicion and opposition, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
According to February reports (although most of the cases were limited to China), Chinese residents have been exposed to racist sentiments in various groups around the world that deserve the virus to be claimed in lieu of justification.
In some African countries, anti-Chinese sentiment has also been seen.
Many of the Refugees in Wuhan and Hobby have reported the disparity they've dealt with on a regional basis.
For Chinese, both online and offline, and those in areas affected by the virus have been supported.
Following outbreaks and outbreaks in other countries of the pandemic, Italians, the first country in Europe to be infected with COVID-19, may be in fear of such suspicions and strangers, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have signed petitions seeking to ban Chinese people from entering their countries in an effort to curb the disease.
The hashtag <0x23>ChineseDontComeToJapan has become a trend on Twitter in Japan.
Chinese people, as well as other Asians living in the UK and the US, have reported incidents of racism-based abuse and humiliation.
U.S. President Donald Trump has faced criticism for calling the coronavirus a "Chinese virus," with critics calling the term racist and anti-China.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners who had been evacuated from Wuhan.
Students coming from northern India, bordering China and studying in major cities of India, had to face harassment from the spread of the coronavirus.
Dilip Ghosh, president of the Bharatiya Janata Party's state unit in West Bengal, stated that China had destroyed nature and "that's why God has avenged on them."
The statement was later condemned by the Chinese ambassador in Calcutta, calling it "misleading" and said the fear of foreigners in China since the pandemic has fueled feelings of racism from non-Chinese residents, calling foreigners "foreign waste" that is "to be stopped."
Many newspapers in Paywall have removed them for some or all of their coronavirus coverage.
The publishers of many scientific materials made scientific papers related to this spread available to all.
Many scientists quickly sent their results to the server, such as BioRixiv, before publication.

Laboratory tests for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 viruses include procedures that identify the presence and presence of the virus that produce antibodies as a result of infection.
RT-PCR confirms the presence of the virus as a sample, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and only designed to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm a very recent or active infection.
Antibiotics (Serialology) can also be used to diagnose and monitor the population.
Antibody tests show how many people had the disease, including those who had so few symptoms that it was too rare to report or show no symptoms.
Based on the results of these tests, the exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of immunity in a population can be determined.
Due to limited testing, as of now, no country has reliable data on the spread of the virus in its population as of March 2020.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there is also a huge difference in how much testing has been done between countries.
The death toll due to this variant is highly disputed in the report, which is likely to be higher in some countries.
The test can be obtained in a variety of ways on respiratory samples using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), including samples of nasopharyngeal bloating or spitting.
Results are usually available in a few hours to two days.
The PT-PCR test is only valid in the first week of the disease.
Later when it begins to grow in the lungs, the virus disappears into the throat.
For those affected by the second week of testing, alternatively sample material can be used by suction catheter from deep airways or cough up material (thick).
The first PCR tests were developed in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) at the site of charity in Berlin, which became the basis for the distribution of 250,000 kits by the World Health Organization (WHO).
On January 28, 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical-grade, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerCheck coronavirus).
It searches for the "E" gene that is transmitted by the beta coronavirus, and the RdRP gene is specific to the SARS-CoV-2 distribution. The BGI group in China was among the first companies to be conducting the RPV RITE-RITCH in 2019 by the China's National Medical Product Administration (NMA) to approve the emergency use of its PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit from the International SARS-CoV-2 Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States.
One out of three tests in the older version of the test kit failed to come to a conclusion due to poor chemistry interaction, and less than 100 samples were collected in a single day in February 2020 due to disruption of tests on the CDC in Atlanta.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and this was until state and local laboratories were allowed to test.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under an emergency use authorization, with U.S. business labs starting testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the nationwide availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19.
Quest Diagnostics has now made COVID-19 testing available across the country as of March 9, 2020.
Quantity limits have not been announced; the collection and further processing of samples must be in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and developed by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On March 12, 2020, the Mayo Clinic reported that it had prepared a test for the detection of COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for the test, which could be done in a large number of hours, i.e., a machine could do about 4,128 tests over a 24-hour period.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott's m2000 system to Abbott Laboratories; the FDA had previously granted similar permissions to Holistic, LabCorp and Themo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid received EUA from the FDA for a test that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Because it doesn't require a series of alternative temperature cycles, this method allows for positive results in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently 18,000 such machines in the U.S. and Abbott expects to increase the number of these machines to 50,000 tests per day, a test that uses monoclonal antibody that is specifically limited to the nucleocaproid protein (N protein) of the novel coronavirus.
The closing words of the review of written material in March 2020 are "the diagnosis of chest radiographs in the initial floor is of no importance, but the presence of [CT computed tomography] is possible before symptoms appear."
The general features of the CT are two-way multi-loubber ground glass blurred, which includes the synchronous and back-end partitions.
It is as the disease grows, the development of complete domination, madness smoothness and stability.
Wuhan, where this global epidemic originated, in a study comparing between PCR and CT suggested that CT is more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, many of its properties are similar to pneumonia and disease stages.
As of March 2020, the U.S. College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used as the first priority for diagnosis of COVID-19.
The immune response to the infection, including IgM and IgG, is the partial response to the development of antibodies.
They can be used to detect infection in people who have had symptoms for 7 days, to determine immunity, and for those who are under intensive surveillance.
In many clinical laboratories, high-end automated systems will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will be limited to the rate of production for each system.
For CLT, a single sample of blood is commonly used, although many samples can be used to measure the strength of the immune system.
For PoCT, a sample of blood is usually obtained by drilling on the skin.
On March 26, 2020, the FDA listed 29 entities that provide notifications to the agency and therefore are now able to distribute their antibody tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test was approved under the FDA's emergency use authorization.In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics were approved by Europe for their test kits, which could detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples.
It has the ability to test hundreds of samples in a few hours, so it is much faster than the traditional PCR for the detection of RNA virus.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after the start of the infection, and in early April the UK found that none of the test kits purchased were accurate enough to be used.
Hong Kong has introduced a scheme that suspected patients can stay at home, "the emergency department will give the patient a sample tube of the test tube" to the patient after the test is done, he will get it from the patient to the doctor, send it back to the doctor after the test is done, and after the procedure is completed, the patient will be able to return to the hospital to be tested on an experimental basis.
The National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians in Germany said on March 2 that it has the capacity to perform 12,000 tests per day in normal seating and 10,700 tests last week.
When it comes to fitness tests, the costs are covered by health insurance.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to conduct 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, the drive-in tests were offered in several major cities.
The number of tests conducted in Germany as of 26 March 2020 was not known, as only positive results are reported.
According to the first lab survey, 483,295 samples were tested by the calendar week of 12/2020 and this week 10,000 samples were tested positive from the sample (%6.9) of the sample of the sample in the sample of the sample in the sample of the sample in the month of February, 2020 and 33,491 samples (%) came positive for the sample of the sample in the month of February.

The Wuhan laboratory's procedures were immediately adopted by Huo-Yan laboratories located in Shenzhen, Tianjin, and Shanghai, thus totaling 12 cities across China.
As of March 4, 2020, Origami Assays has released an open-source multi-anasor design that can test 1122 COVID-19 patients with only 93 attempts.
As of March, shortages and inadequate amounts of reagents have become a barrier to mass testing in the EU and the UK and the US.
As a result, some authors have investigated the protocol for the preparation of samples, which limits the sample to 98 C (208 F) for 5 minutes to emit the RNA genome or chromosome for further testing.
Such a drive-through capability and profit from both Group 42 and BGI (based on their China-based emergency detection labs "HUO-Yan") developed for a larger population.
Established in 14 days, the laboratory carried out 1,000 RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory to operate on such a large scale other than China.
Various testing techniques have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States to target different parts of the genetic proof of the coronavirus.
The World Health Organization used the German structure for low-income countries that do not have the resources to make cuts.
The German structure, published on January 17, 2020, was not available in the United States until January 28, due to concerns over the quality of test kits in China and the United States in the early days of the pandemic, and it could not provide cuts despite recommendations and demands from countries and Australia health experts.
On the other hand, experts say that South Korea's large supply of testing reduced the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The South Korean government has developed testing capabilities in private-sector laboratories over the past few years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization (WHO) called for strengthening testing programs to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing the demand for testing, stopping tens of thousands of tests in U.S. private laboratories, and stressing the supply of wound healing soaps and chemicals.
In March 2020, China reported a problem with the accuracy of its test kits.
The cuts made by the CDC in the U.S. were "difficult," with the government again removing office barriers that led to private testing. Spain bought the cuts from Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioaesy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were not accurate.
The firm explained that the reason for the wrong results was the lack of proper use of samples or cuttings.
Spain's Ministry of Health said that the wrong-doing cuts will be removed and replaced with the testing kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the state checks purchased from China gave wrong results.
The Turkish health ministry's Atis Kara said the cuts that Turkey bought from China "had a very high miscalculation rate" and were "not in use."The UK bought 3.5 million test kits from China but announced in early April 2020 that they were "unusual."
In the event of a positive test result, the efforts to detect people who were quarantined and those who were in contact with patients with SARS-CoV-2 have yielded good results.
In the Italian town of Vo, Italy, where the first death from COVID-19 occurred, working researchers from the entire population, which consisted of about 3,400 people, were tested twice for at least ten days.
About half of the people who were tested had no symptoms, and all the detected cases were quarantined.
Due to the limited travel to a particular human group, new cases of infection have completely disappeared.
The 2020 coronavirus pandemic, thanks to extensive contact tracing, travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, has had little impact on Singapore than in the developed countries of the world, where there were no stricter restrictions, such as forcing the businesses of retailers and retailers to close.
Many events have been disrupted, and Singapore began advising citizens to stay confined to their homes from March 28, but schools reopened on time after the holidays ended on March 23.
Many other countries have also been able to overcome the pandemic through tough measures such as detection, travel restrictions, testing, and quarantine, but have not imposed stricter lockdowns, such as those in Iceland and South Korea.
According to a statistical study, countries that have tested for high, mortality rates have a lower mortality rate, perhaps because these countries have been able to detect people with little or no symptoms.
The WHO has recommended that countries that do not have the ability to test and the national laboratories to deal with COVID-19, send their first five positive and ten negative COVID-19 samples to the WHO's 16 refrigeration laboratories for testing.
Out of these 16 reference labs, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
The column "% of positive tests" in the chart below is related to a country's testing policy.
The country that tests only those admitted to the hospital, the percentage of positive tests there will be higher than the country that tests all citizens, whether they have symptoms or not, they will all be treated the same.
Hand washing (or hand washing) is also known as hand hygiene, the purpose of this process is to cleanse your hands with soil, grease, germs, or other non-essential materials.
On some "necessary occasions", frequent hand-washing with soap in a day prevents many diseases from spreading, for example diarrhea and hemorrhoids entering the mouth.
People may also suffer from respiratory diseases such as influenza or common colds, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucus membranes).
Five essential occasions in a day when washing hands with soap are very important: before and after going to the toilet, after cleaning the baby's bottom or changing diapers, before feeding the baby, before eating and before preparing food, or after touching raw meat, fish, or chicken.
If water and soap are not available, the hands can also be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization has given the following suggestions for hand washing:
Before, during and after preparing food.
Before and after the illness of the patient.
After changing the diaper or cleaning the child using the toilet.
After cleaning the nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching the animal, animal feed or animal waste.
Medical hygiene means that the medical procedure must be in accordance with the principles of hygiene.
Washing hands or taking medical care before taking medication can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
Medically, the main purpose of washing hands is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or spread disease.
This is especially true for people who are involved in the food or medical field, but it is also a good habit for the general public.
Hand washing has many medical benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing causes of diarrheal disease; reducing respiratory infections;
and a decrease in the mortality rate of children born at home.
A 2013 study showed that improving the habit of hand washing in children under the age of five significantly improves the height.
In developing countries, simple changes in habits can reduce child mortality due to respiratory and diarrheal diseases, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action can reduce deaths due to these diseases by up to 50%.
Interventions that encourage hand washing can reduce mortality by one-third from diarrheal events, and can be compared with the supply of clean water in low-income areas.
Hand washing with soap can reduce the mortality rate by up to 48%. Hand washing with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive means of prevention of diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI). It is an automated procedure that can be practiced in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia is the leading cause of death among children under the age of five, an important ARI, which takes the lives of about 1.8 million children each year.
Both diarrhea and pneumonia cause about 3.5 million children's deaths each year.
According to the UNICEF, changing the habit of washing hands before and after eating can save more lives than using a vaccine or medically ingested, i.e., half a drop in mortality due to diarrhea and a quarter a drop in deaths due to acute respiratory infections.
Handwashing is usually part of other health and hygiene items, namely water, drainage, and hygiene programs (WASH).
Hand washing also protects against diseases that are transmitted directly from the membrane.
A small loss of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can damage the skin by drying out the skin.
According to a 2012 Danish study, excessive hand washing can cause skin irritation, which is commonly found in people associated with the medical field.
Frequent hand washing is also seen as a sign of excessive anxiety (OCD).
There are five such delicate occasions in a day when it is very important to wash your hands with soap to reduce the disease spread through waste and mouth: after using the bathroom (pain or pimple), after cleaning the baby from the bottom of the baby (change of diaper), before feeding the baby, before eating food and before and after cooking or touching the chicken or raw meat.
Those other occasions when washing hands properly to prevent the transmission of the disease include: before and after sneezing from the wound; after sneezing, coughing or sneezing; after sneezing, coughing or sneezing; after sneezing of the animal's waste or animal's management and disposal; and after shaving the sedative.
In many countries, the rate of hand washing with soap is low.
According to a 2015 study of hand washing in 54 countries, on average, 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. According to a 2014 study, the highest rate of hand washing in Saudi Arabia is 97%; in the middle of the United States, 77%; and in China, the lowest rate of hand washing is 23%.
The mandatory "health protection program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a large-scale promotion of children's health and education.
The national program includes twice a year insect bites as well as daily hand washing with soap, daily tooth cleaning with fluoride.
It has also been successfully applied in Indonesia.
The process of removing germs from the skin has improved by adding soap and detergents to the water.
The real job of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barrier of dissolution and increase the solution posterior.
Only water is not enough to clean the skin because fats and proteins, which are organic clay components, are not easily dissolved in water.
Cleanliness, however, is with the help of proper flow of water.
In solid soaps, due to reuse, bacteria can be present due to past use.
A few studies that have studied the transfer of bacteria from solid-contaminated soaps say that this cannot happen because the bacteria leave with foam.
The CDC still says that "liquid soap without hands-on control is preferable".
Antibacterial soaps have been greatly promoted in the health-conscious public.
So far, there is no evidence that using the recommended antibacterial drugs produces antibiotic-resistant organic organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps have common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which is resistant to organic organisms.
So if antibacterial soaps do not choose antibiotic-resistant, they will not be as effective as they have been said about them.
In addition to the normalization of soothing substances and skin protection, a more hygienic formulation can contain antibacterial, antibacterial active benzonic acid (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid), and also of the skin conditioner (elo vera, vitamins, menthol, plant varieties).
The hot water in which the hand is conveniently not so hot that it can kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37<0xC2><0xB0>C).
However, natural oils, which absorb soil and bacteria, are more effective than semi-hot, soapy water-cooled soap-mixed water to remove.
However, contrary to public belief, scientific studies say that semi-hot water is not effective for reducing germs by hand.
A hand sanitizer or hand anti-septic is a non-water-based hand hygiene agent.
In the 1990s and early 21st century, non-water-based hand hygiene (also known as alcohol-based hand washing, germ-based hand cleaning, or hand sanitizer) began to gain fame.
Most isopropyl alcohols are based on ethanol mixed in a cart, such as carbomers (multiple molecular compounds of multi-acre acid) made into a gelatin or in a liquid substance such as glycerin for ease of use and to reduce the effect of alcohol dryness.
Adding oxides to dissolved hydrogen increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing alcohol content of 60 to 95% are effective germs.
Alcoholic cyanosis kills bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), TB, and some viruses (HIV, herpes, RSV, Rhinoviruses, Vixenia, influenza, hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcoholic cinnasters that contain 70% alcohol (a reduction of 3.5 logs, equivalent to a reduction of 35 decibels) kill %99.97 bacteria 30 seconds after use and from %99.99 to %99.999 minutes after use (a reduction of 4 to 5 in the logs) kill bacteria.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective for the Norovirus (Norwalk), which is the most common cause of infectious disease of the small intestine.
Mix the front and back of both hands and the middle and the last parts of all fingers for about 30 seconds, until the material, foam, or gel is dry.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing with hand sanitizer, especially when the hands are obviously contaminated.
The reason for the rapid use of such materials is their ease of use and the ability to kill germs quickly; however, they should not be considered an alternative to formal handwashing, and should be used when soap and water are not available.
Excessive use of alcohol-based cyanide can dry out the skin, unless cream and/or skin moistening are added to the formula.
Glycerin and/or other creams can be added to the formula to reduce or eliminate the drying effect of alcohol.
Clinical experiments have shown that using alcohol-based hand sanitizers that included creams, compared to soaps or anti-microbial detergents, make the skin less burning and dry.
In the case of a very high sensitivity to various diseases or alcoholism, or alcohol-intoxicating substances may sometimes cause an allergic complaint.
Compared to washing hands with soap and water, they tend to be less prone to burn-in diseases.
Despite their effectiveness, unwatered amalgams are not able to clear organic materials, they only cleanse them from germs.
That's why hand sanitizers are no more effective than soap and water to prevent the spread of many germs, as germs remain on hand.
Most of the effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizer is dependent on ingredients and synthesis, and historically it has not been very effective.
Among the recipes that have been used in recent days have seen overall antimicrobial activity after use, in contrast to alcohol, and after repeated use, perhaps due to the reaction that occurs in the skin, its effectiveness has decreased.
In many low-income societies, people do not buy soap and instead use ash or clay.
Ash and soil can be more effective than just water, but less than soap.
There is a risk that if soil or debris is contaminated by germs, it may increase the risk of disease rather than decrease.
Like soap, ash is a disinfectant because after mixing with water it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash or soil in the event of not having soap.
The recommended hand-washing procedure by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in order to prevent the spread of the disease, includes the following:
Wash your hands with warm or cold water.
A lot of water is recommended because standing water can be contaminated, while water temperature does not matter.
Rub the hands with a reasonable amount of soap, including the back of the hands, the middle spaces of the fingers, and the bottom of the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and research has found that people wash their hands better when they use soap instead of just water.
for at least 20 seconds.
Mixing leads to friction, which helps to remove the germs from the skin, and removes more germs than rubbing for longer periods of time.
Clean with a lot of water.
Washing hands in basins can contaminate the hands again.
Clean with a dry towel or let the air dry.
Wet and damp hands can be easily re-contaminated. The commonly left parts include the thumb, wrist, spaces between the fingers, and around the nails.
Artificial nails and semi-automatic nail polish can be the source of germs.
Moisture lotions are usually recommended to protect the hands from drying; dry skin can damage the skin quickly, which can increase the risk of infection transmission.
Where faucet water and/or soap are not available, many low-cost facilities can be provided for them, such as indulating water from a hanging container or loco-like vegetable with suitable holes, and/or using ash in developing countries if necessary.
Tippy-tap is a simple technology with a jug that hangs from a rope, and a lever moving from the legs, which pours a little bit of water on a stick of hands and soap.
Effectively drying the hands is part of the hand hygiene process, but there is debate over what is the most effective way to dry in public sanitisers.
Most research suggests that paper towels are better than electric drawers, which are often found in purifiers.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, conducted a study, sponsored by the paper towel manufacturing industry, the European tissue symposium, which included paper towels, warm-air hand dryers and modern jet air-heavy dryers.
After washing hands and drying hands with warm air dryer, the rate of bacteria on finger mattresses increased by an average of 194%, and on the palms by 254%.
Drying from jet air dryer resulted in a 42% increase in the rate of bacteria on the fingers and 15% on the palms.
After washing hands and drying with tissue paper, the total number of bacteria on the pads of the fingers decreased by an average of 76 per cent and on the palms by 77 per cent.
Jet Air Drainer, which discharges air from the unit at a claimed speed of 180m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), has the ability to blow up the germs from the hands and the unit, and can contaminate the environment of other users and cleaners by 2 meters.
Hot air hand dryer can spread the germ to a distance of 0.25 m from the dryer.
In 2005, a study by TUV Produkt und Umwelt examined various hand drying methods.
The following changes occurred in the number of bacteria after drying hands:
There are many hand dryer different dryer manufacturers, and the dryers have been compared to paper towels.
Hand washing is an alternative to handwashing with soap and water in the absence of soap and water during travel.
Alcohol-based cyanide contains at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing was made mandatory by Hungarian physiologist Ignaz Semmelweis after discovering its effectiveness in the hospital environment (1846).
There are electrical appliances that provide feedbacks to hospital staff so that when they forget, they are reminded to wash their hands.
According to one study, their use reduced the rate of infection.
Medically hand washing is for at least 15 seconds, soap and water or gel should be used in a certain amount to make the foam and rub every part of the hand.
The fingers of the hands should be rubbed against each other.
If there is a match in the fingernails, a hard-haired brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can remain in the water in the hands, it is important to wash them thoroughly with water and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, paper towels should be used to close the water (and if necessary to open the door to go back).
This will not contaminate the hands again after they have been applied to these surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in a health care setting is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germ") and avoid moving them.
According to a report in the New England Journal of Medicine, even in the medical environment, the rate of hand washing is unacceptable, with a large number of doctors and nurses forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients in the usual way, thus becoming a means of transmitting germs.
According to a study, proper hand washing and other simple methods reduce the rate of urinary tract-related infections by up to 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a paper showing the right way to wash hands and shake hands in the health sector.
The draft guidance on hand hygiene by the agency can be seen on their website for public comments.
A related review was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can test and verify the health and hygiene of the hand, if such a procedure is required.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified five ways to wash your hands.
in the presence of blood/body
Prior to the outbreak of the virus, and
After taking care of the patient. The addition of germicidal chemicals (“medicated or “antimicrobial” soap) in the soap meets the hand-washing agent.
Such disinfection is required where there is a lot of antibiotic-resistant organisms before surgery or where the operation is performed. For the operation, it is necessary to have a device "stitched" your hands. A second device that can be opened and closed without touching your hands, rinsed with chlorhexidine or iodine, then rinsed with a finger, cleanse with chlorhexidine or iodine, to dry your hands after washing.
All the ornaments should be removed.
In this process, wash hands from the wrist to the elbows, usually 6-2 minutes.
No need to wait for 10 minutes.
When water is being poured on the middle part of the arm, be sure not to turn back to the hands.
When the washing of hands is complete, the hands are dry with germ-free cloth and the surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash hands before and after seeing the patient or to place the germs in the hands.
In order to control staphylococcal infection in hospitals, research has found that the highest benefits of hand washing were derived from the first 20% drip, and that when this rate was increased from 35%, there was little additional benefit.
The use of simple soaps in the transmission of bacterial infectious disease in the diet showed three times the effect. Alcohol-based solution and antibacterial soaps were found to have a reduction of alcohol to alcohol by 26 percent compared to alcohol-contaminated bacteria.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based solution to remove H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile spores by hand. If hand hygiene is improved in health-related places, handwashing and handwashing will require staffing, hand-washing, and hand-washing.
More research is needed to find out what measures are more effective in a variety of health-related settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered to be a source of low cost, good health, and even good nutrition.
However, due to the lack of regular supply of water, soap and hand-washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces, it is a major challenge to adopt the global hand-washing habit of all people.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, it is very rare to have a hand-washing unit near a private or public toilet, although there are many less expensive forms of hand-washing.
However, the low hand washing rate may also be the reason for the habit being firm, rather than a lack of soap and water.
Incentives and promotion of hand washing with soap can affect decision-making, create awareness about the benefits of hand washing, and create far-reaching changes in the behavior of the population.
Monitoring and testing are necessary to make this effective.
A formal study of 70 students found that LMICs are more effective at working in a particular community, while social marketing advertising is less effective. One way of promoting handwashing in schools is by UNICEF, in addition to the "three-star approach" to raising their hands.
When they reach the minimum standard, schools can reach second and then third stars.
Making hand-washing spaces may be part of a hand-washing promotion series, aimed at reducing diseases and deaths in children.
World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness of this promotional series, which aims to change behaviour. As a result of the global coronavirus pandemic of 2019-20, UNICEF has encouraged the adoption of handwashing emojis.
Some research has found the overall cost of hand washing to be low by ignoring DALYs in developing countries.
However, according to one review, the management of water and its drainage, promoting hand washing with soap is more cost-effective.
The importance of hand washing for human health - especially for those in unsafe conditions, such as mothers who have just given birth to a baby or wounded soldier in the hospital - was first recognized by two first-time physicians in the mid-19th century.
At the time, most people still thought that the cause of the infection was the smell.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the 1980s, due to food-borne illnesses and public health-related infections, promoted more intensive hand hygiene as a key means of preventing the spread of infection.
The outbreak of the swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 promoted a warning in many countries that washing hands with soap is essential to prevent such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "right hand washing techniques" were hung in hand-washing places outside the public toilet, in the toilets of office buildings, and at the airport in Germany.
The saying "Washing one's hands of" means someone who does not take responsibility for something or declares not to say anything.
The proverb relates to the Bible in Matthew, where the Pontius Pilate expressed his displeasure with the decision to hang Jesus on the cross, but it later became a proverb in the English-speaking society.
In Shakespeare's play Macbeth, Lady Macbeth finds herself forced to wash her hands in an attempt to clean up a thoughtful stain, which reveals the mystery of her guilt of murdering her husband.
It has also come to light that people, after recalling or considering unethical practices, wash more hands than others, and attach great importance to hand washing dishes.
Furthermore, those who wash their hands after such thoughts are less likely to participate in other activities of "cleaning", such as volunteering.
Religions also suggest washing of hands under hygienic and symbolic purposes. The use of soapless water for washing hands is a characteristic of many religions: e.g. Bah<0xC3><0xA1>'<0xC3><0xAD> faith, Hinduism, Tola in Judaism, Netellat Mem<0xC3><0xA1>m, Lavabo in Christianity, and so on.
It is mandatory to wash your hands after the use of toilets in Hinduism, Judaism and Islam.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash hands before and after every meal.
Controlling the Risks of Workplaces for COVID-19
Controlling the risks in workplaces for COVID-19 is to implement occupational safety and health measures to prevent the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper control of risks in the workplace depends on the nature of the work place and the type of work, the risk assessment of exposure sources, the severity of the disease in the community, and in workers who may be unsafe for COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-disclosure risk jobs are those that have minimal professional contact with the public and other carers, which suggest basic measures to prevent infection, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, breathing patterns, and keeping the work environment clean and disinfected.
The risk of mid-discovery is those jobs that are in contact with people who are not known to be infected with COVID-19, but may be affected by social transfers and international travel.
This includes workers who have contact with the public, such as in schools, work environments in a densely populated population, and more number of retail spaces.
In addition to the basic safety measures for infection prevention, there are high-performance air filters, sneezing protection for air movement, and personal protective equipment, if faced with a COVID-19-infected person.
OSHA considers the appearance of health care and morgue workers in front of a person suffering or suspected of COVID-19 to be at greater risk, with a greater exposure risk if workers perform aerosol-producing procedures or collect or maintain samples from a known or suspected person with COVID-19.
Appropriate measures will be taken to control the risk for these workers, such as rooms with negative pressures of air movement, and personal protective equipment that are in accordance with the nature of the work.
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the workplace can be enormous.
Workers may be absent due to the risk of getting sick, the safety of others, or the fear of being exposed to the disease.
The trading procedures may vary, both in terms of demand for goods and also in terms of the acquisition of those goods (such as purchases at low altitude times, or delivery or draw-through facilities).
Finally, geographically there may be a disruption in shipments from areas severely affected by COVID-19. Plans to prepare for and respond to infectious disease can be used to guide preventive actions.
Plans indicate risk levels associated with different workplaces and employment practices, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from home and community setting, and risk factors for individual workers such as aging or chronic medical conditions.
It also outlines emergency plans for ways to control these outbreaks and the situation arising as a result of the outbreaks that are necessary to deal with these risks.
Preparedness and response plans for infectious disease can be the subject of national or regional proposals.
Reducing transmission between staff in response to an epidemic, protecting those who are at risk due to poor health complications, and reducing adverse effects on business activities and supply.
The community in which the business is located affects the response to the severity of the disease.
The Risk Control Rating Framework is very effective in occupational safety and health, in order to effectively control group risks.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are the controls that are put in place, followed by administrative controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
Employee control is designed to separate employees from work-related risks, without relying on their behavior, and may be the most cost-effective solution for the application.
Administrative control refers to the change in the policy and procedures of the work, which require action from the worker or owner.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative control, but may help prevent some appearances.
All types of PPE should be chosen based on the hazards posed to workers, properly installed, if applied (e.g., a salinity-taking device), continuous and properly dressed, restoratively painful and altered, whichever is needed, if properly removed, cleaned and stored or destroyed to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-disclosure risk jobs are in minimal professional contact with the public and other stakeholders.
The basic steps to prevent infection in all workplaces that have been recommended include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, breathing routines and routines, including coughing and sneezing, hand washing, providing mouth coverings, tissue and scarring, talking to others, phone calls or if necessary, frequent attendance.
The identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is a worrying step to protect workers, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of severe respiratory illness stay at home until they have fever, fever symptoms, or any other symptoms allowing employees to stay home for at least 24 hours without the use of informed fever or other symptoms.
According to OSHA, mid-discovery hazards are jobs that require close or continuous contact from a distance of six feet (1.8 meters) from people who are not known to be suspected or infected with COVID-19, but have been caused by community transmission around the business or may have been affected by SARS-CoV-2, or because of the person's recent international travel to the area where COVID-19 has been transmitted.
This includes workers who have contact with the public, such as workers from the workplace, workers from the workplace, from the workplace, from the workplace to the workplace, from the workplace to the workplace, from the workplace to the workplace, from the workplace to the workplace, from the workplace to the workplace, and from the workplace to the workplace, from the workplace to the workplace, from the workplace and the workplace to the workplace.
In this group of risk workers, the use of the device is rare.
If a person falls sick in an airplane, it means proper control to protect workers and other passengers, keep the sick person 6 feet apart from others, assign a staff member to the patient, and offer the sick person a face mask, or tell the patient to cover their mouth and hands with a tissue.
When approaching a sick passenger or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, the crew should wear disposable gloves and possibly additional personal protective equipment, if the sick passenger has a fever, permanent cough, or difficulty in breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in bags made for this purpose, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected later on. For commercial ships, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk-taking includes the suspension of travel in case of illness, and isolation and fever, or any other medical indication, if the ship is present.
The CDC recommends a short-term closure for schools and child care centers if an infected person has come to the school building, even if he or she has not spread the virus, to be cleaned or disinfected.
When there is a transition from small to medium-sized virus, social distancing strategies can be applied, such as outdoor activities, assemblies, and other large gatherings such as physical education or music classes, or canceling meals in the cafeteria.
When there is a substantial shift in the local community, in addition to the social distancing strategy, the long-term closure of schools can also be considered. Law enforcement personnel who are performing their daily activities, according to the CDC, are considered to be less at risk of immediate health.
Law enforcement officers who have to contact people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 are recommended to adhere to the same guidelines as those for emergency technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If there is close contact during the panic, workers should clean and disinfect their duty belt and gear using household cleaning sprays or wipes before reuse, and follow the standard implementation procedure for using the used PPE and disinfecting the contents and washing clothes.
According to OSHA, workers in some health centers and deadhouses are at greater or greater risk of exposure.
The most exposed jobs include healthcare delivery, support, laboratory, and medical transport workers who are exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
They become very exposed when workers take aerosol-making action, or collect or manage samples of known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
In aerosol-making action, inserting grooves, coughing procedures, inspecting throat tubes, some dental cartilage and inspections, or collection of unpleasant patterns.
The high-risk jobs in the morgue include workers who develop dead bodies of people who were known or suspected to have COVID-19 at the time of death; these risk groups include additional controls set in place, including isolation rooms for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, as and when the procedure for making aerosol is followed.
Special negative-pressure air flow devices may be appropriate in some health centers and deadhouses.
Samples should be touched under the safety measures of Biosafety Level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be quarantined in specific waiting rooms depending on whether they have suspected COVID-19 cases.In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends device respiration for those who work 6 feet away from a known patient or SARS-CoV-2 suspect, and those who perform aerosol-producing action.
The N95 filtering device approved by NIOSH should be used in light of a comprehensive and written safety respirator program in the US, including appropriate testing, training, and medical testing.
Other types of devices can provide better respiratory protection and improve the comfort of the worker. WHO does not recommend covering completely, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and not a transfer from the body's tissues.
WHO recommends only surgical masks in place of the screen of entry for staff.
Individuals who are collecting respiratory samples, caring for or transmitting COVID-19 patients without an aerosol-making procedure, WHO recommends shields, gowns and scarves for surgical masks, glasses, or face.
If the aerosol maker method is performed, replace the surgical mask with an N95 or FFP2 device.
Knowing that the global delivery of PPE is insufficient, WHO telemedicine, material barriers such as clean windows, only allowing those who are directly caring for the COVID-19 patient to enter the room, the use of PPE is essential for specific work, the use of the same device without the use of masks and the management of many patients with the same disease, the use of the same respiratory care, the monitoring of the PPE supply chain without the use of the same device.

Post date/time: March 14, 2020, 00:24UTC
L.A.C.: There are no rights
This month we are facing a lot of challenges.
The COVID-19 pandemic is the one that has made it clear that humans are universally connected and we have a responsibility to each other.
We don't have an example of such a challenge before, but we know well that our best response is global cohesion, cooperation, and social construction that continues to be the soul of this organization.
The feelings of friendship and attention we've seen in emails, phone calls, and chats in all of our cars are a testament to how lucky we are to be working with amazing people.
I can't be more grateful and proud that you're all my friends.
Last week, I was asked by someone to do my job.
He reminded me of how important it is for the world to turn to Wikipedia now, and how strong it is for this delicate resource that online is available to all.
Your work has made it possible, whether you're with sites, or our cars that have payments, or our community is safe.
The world needs information and Wikipedia provides it, now more than ever.
This is the moment in which not only what we do, but how we do it, will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Given the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some important changes from this coming week to how we work together.
Changes in our work and schedule.
As Robyn expressed earlier, there was a meeting of the c-team last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
In this conversation, we looked at what would have been the most appropriate response to what we are facing and how to keep the argonization on its feet at the moment.
In full force, we ended the tension for a long time and wanted to promote our mission.
If you want to download it, okay.
All staff, contractors and workers:
Our daily work expectations will be about 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week, until the order is renewed,
We're not announcing a holiday - if you can work according to normal hours, the mission can get you used to.
However, nothing can be said about the world at the moment, and whether you need to take care of your loved ones, buy a bargain, or go to a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We don't waste your time.
Don't work if you're sick.
We don't have to say that, but we are saying it.
No need for days of illness or PTO - just tell your manager and help redesign your team's calendar and schedule, making sure all aspects of the work are fulfilled.
(If you get a positive diagnosis for COVID-19, inform Bryan within T&C Ops, then T&C can help with support and make sure that the administration pays proper attention to your situation).
All hours of work will be paid.
We've said it before, and we're repeating our contractors and hourly staff while carrying out our duties.
Each person will be paid according to their hours of meeting during normal circumstances.
This includes if you are sick or unable to work.
If you want to work, we will help you.
Many people work around the world to change their mindset.
What we can do is incredibly rewarding, especially in times like these.
Again, this is all for your own safety.
All we have to say is that you talk to your manager, this will give us an idea of what to expect from you and then set things up accordingly.
No work is considered essential.
There are some things that we need to keep going.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and fundraising teams (other than others) work hard, which may require additional support.
We examine current goals with all sectors and change our focus to support what is necessary for our mission.
We all have a lot to do, we'll just focus our attention on all the most important projects.
Slowing down at this time won't hurt us later.
We don't plan on "what to do" once this pandemic passes.
You are not expected to work extra time to meet deadlines, which are currently unrealistic.
We recognize that things have changed, and where appropriate, we will work to set new goals and deadlines.
What is an Annual Plan (APP)?
In order to set our new reality and expectations for daily work hours, we intend to organize our annual plan for 2020-2021.
We want to expand our 2019-2020 plan, which takes more time to create a budget where workers will be allowed to change their work preferences, and will be able to look after their loved ones in a situation that accommodates those in need who want to work for a shorter period of time.
This extension of time will greatly reduce the work and pressure of the project present throughout the organization.
We will announce our plans to the board next week and inform the teams and teams about the next step.
Thank you for leading the team.
Office status, appearance and cleanliness
Last week, we heard that one of our SF-based friends could be infected with COVID-19.
However, despite a lot of caution, we have also put in place an anti-virus procedure in the San Francisco office to cleanse all levels.
He used a hospital-grade disinfectant solution to clean the arms of bramadah and stairways at every level that allows access to our chest.
The building is using its own visual protocol products that stand out for the safety of its tenants.
We feel comfortable that the office will be in perfect condition at the moment as soon as we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in Vwork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with all DC office staff members and with us.
By the end of last week, our DC office had moved to a remote location, in accordance with the San Francisco Joint Directive.
As some of us know, we are also renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing, but may be delayed.
Some of my friends are working from home for the first time.
With our old age, we know that it can be a little adjustment and want to give you some advice.
The duration of the meeting can be extended to more than one or two hours.
If long seats are needed, think about how to divide them on different days.
Make the meeting clear as each one of the agendas, and send the falling content first.
By default, you can use services such as Google Docs and Zoom for direct collaboration and communication.
Take the lead in providing support for each meeting, overseeing a discussion for questions, and observing a list of speakers, and helping someone take a note (or make a note with mutual support).
If you are in need of technical assistance, send an email.
Take advantage of the benefits of synchronization.
Join the <0x23>Remotes channel in Slack to talk to my colleagues about distributed work.
The HR functional team is considering webinar-based ergonomics guidance to contribute to the distribution of the entire foundation.
Last week, we called on all social media recipients to cancel Wikimedia's privileged public events, such as Eddie's, until the World Health Organization announced the end of the pandemic.
They should be aware that we understand that our cancellation request and other restrictions may make it possible to complete the activities of the cooperation they have accepted and that there will be no penalty for modifying or slowing down these goals.
In the coming week, we will follow additional guidance on Wikimania and other regional and topical social conferences.
The general sentiments of the entire international community are saddened by this disruption but are satisfied with the clean ability to focus on their own communities, wikimedia etc.
Moving forward, CRT is working on creating a web page on MetaWiki to give the community a chance to observe and monitor their interactions with them.
Keep in touch with COVID-19 related issues.
We will also invite you to a special meeting next Thursday 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to share the most up-to-date information, answer your questions, and spend some time connecting with each other.
We are there to help each other as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to get information from this email and other essential information related to COVID-19 on the Office wiki.
CRT will keep all the latest and all the information on this page in one place.
We are working to establish close contacts with staff members who are currently living in countries that are heavily affected.
If you need help with travel, events, an important task, or a coverage challenge, or anything else, please do not hesitate to work with CRT and get information.
We are here to provide timely support and communication.
If you have a secret or sensitive matter, please e-mail Brian Judan, Director HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as abandoning our work and responsibilities.
Rather, they are a recognition of the occasion, our work and responsibilities will need to be carried out in a way that we have never seen before.
These are actions that we believe are necessary to help each other continue to work, to support our movement with the support it needs and to serve the world on which they depend.
When the time comes, our work will be done.
Now, helping each other is a requirement of time and taking the time to do important work that will come in a few weeks, but will likely come in a few months.
We need you all to do this, and that's why you all need to take care of yourself and your family so that you are in the best condition when you need it.
Don't touch your hands and don't touch your face!
Catherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J. Doren D, Gregory V, Jim V, Joel L., Lent L., Ryan M., and Tony S.), and the rest of the team's leadership (Grant I, Header W), Jim V, Jenna U., Lisa S., Robin A., Ryan M., and Toby N.
B. angiotensin - enzyme 2 converter (ACE2) is an enzyme that binds to the outer surface of cells (cell membranes) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 reduces the amount of angiotensin II of the associated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and increases the amount of ring (1-7) and makes it a reliable drug for the treatment of heart disease. ACE2 acts as an internal point for some coronavirus cells.
The human version of the enzyme is often called hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme is a type of enzyme 2 gastritis that contains metabolism that is found at the endothelial level and in the rest of the cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the N terminal peptides M2 domain and a terminal receptor renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single pass type I protein, which has a secretive active domain on the surface of cells in the lungs and other fibers.
The domain outside the cells of ACE2 is cliched by another enzyme called the transmembrane domain, and as a result, the soluble protein is released into the bloodstream which is eventually released out through urine.
ACE2 is found in most organs: ACE2 is mainly linked to lung type II circulatory cells, small intestine intestines, arterial and vironese endothelial cells, and arterial smooth muscle cells.
The ACE2 MRNA effect is also found in the brain's outer membrane, body receptor, small finger-to-handle, brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as the opposite balance of ACE.
ACE injects angiotensin I hormone into the blood vessels of angiotensin II.
In turn, ACE2 carboxyl terminal amino acid phenollinin is separated from the ingestion II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and is classified as vasodilator ingestion (1-7), (H-Asp-Val-Hol-P).
ACE2 can also distinguish a number of other peptides that include [des-arg 9]-Bridakinin, applen, neurotinase, denorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also controls the movement of the membranes of the SLC6A19 carrying natural amino acids and is involved in mental illness.
As a protein transgene, ACE2 acts as the main catalyst in some coronavirus cells, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
In particular, the binding of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2's spike S1 proteins to the enzymatic domain of ACE2 at the surface of the cell's nucleus leads to the inhalation of the contents of a cell's membrane and the transfer of both viruses and enzymes within the cell.
In this process of intervention, Sprotein is also required to be predominant by the representative Serene Proteas TMPRSS2, which is being prescribed as a potential treatment under the current investigation. This has led some to conclude that due to a lack of ACE2 levels in cells, it may be easier to fight the disease.
However, a number of professional societies and organizations have advised not to continue the normal ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control."
Moreover, the risk of pneumonia in patients treated with ACE inhibitors, who were at high risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure, has also been reduced.
ACE inhibitors are also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related deaths, although its results were less potent than the overall risk of pneumonia."
Human transplantation ACE2 (rhACE2) is a modern treatment for acute wounds of the lungs, and it appeared that it would improve the supply of hemodynamics and oxygen with a lipolysaccharide methyl acute respiratory distress symptoms.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, and in addition to the 24-hour effect, the action starts in 30 minutes.
Several results suggest that RhACE2 may be a better drug for people with intolerance to the classic Rhen-Angiotensin System Prevention (RAS-Prevention) or in diseases where the circulation of angiotensin II is high - RhACE2 asthma has been diagnosed during clinical experiments to treat severe breathing.
B'CoVID-19 apps are mobile apps that help people connect during the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, for example, the process of identifying people ("contacts") who have been in contact with an infected person.
A number of such applications have been created or proposed in several regions and circles in collaboration with the government.
A number of application frameworks have been developed to find communication.
Privacy concerns have been raised, especially regarding the system that the app's user's geographic opportunity to find a palace.
The low-interference alternative involves the use of Bluetooth signals so that the user's location and location can be transferred to another mobile phone.
Google and Apple announced on April 10, 2020 that they will collaborate to integrate these types of Bluetooth-based applications directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay, has developed an app that allows citizens to find out if they were in contact with someone infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 cities in China. The app called Trace Togider is being used in Singapore.
The app was created by a local IT community, which was released as an independent source and will be referred to the government. North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based app called "Stop Corona!" that can detect close contact with potential victims and provide an immediate response to health authorities.
The app has been developed by the Ministry of Information and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
The government said on April 12 that the link-finding app is in the next stage of preparation and will be available for release within a week - a plan for this type of application (the "stop Covid") in Ireland and France.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering developing applications based on Singapore's Trace Togider app and Bluetooth protocol - Russia intends to introduce a geofencing app for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Moscow, to ensure that people don't leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, has come across a number of potential practical difficulties in app-based systems, including false positive results and low effectiveness, if the use of the application is limited to a small segment of the population.
Challenging concerns about the spread of the incorrect or harmful "coronavirus" app, Apple has set limits on what types of organizations can add coronavirus-related applications to their app store, restricting them to "official" or otherwise well-known organizations.
Google and Amazon have also imposed similar restrictions.
Privacy activists have expressed their concerns about the infinite number of surveillance restrictions on the coronavirus app, especially whether the surveillance arrangements set up to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be removed after the threat is eliminated.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for limiting such surveillance arrangements.
The government has issued a number of guidelines for these projects:
The monitoring should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
The monitoring and monitoring should be extended for a specific period of time.
The use of the data will be limited to the purpose of COVID-19;
Data protection and anonymity will be protected and must be disclosed based on evidence;
Digital surveillance must avoid over-discrimination and non-important;
The sharing of data with a third party must be clarified under the law;
There will be safeguards against abuses and citizens will have the right to respond to abuses;
All "relevant partners" will need meaningful participation, including public health experts and non-important groups, the German Knesset Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter Ohan Greensen) (RSF) also issued surveillance lists.
Google/Apple's proposed plan from its operating system device, when it's not needed, intends to address the issue of permanent monitoring by eliminating the monitoring mechanism.
Some countries used a network-based opportunity palace monitoring system instead of an app, which eliminates both the need to download the application and the ability to avoid surveillance.
A network-based monitoring system has been adopted in Israel.
Network-based solutions, which have access to the palace's unearthed data, have the potential for significant privacy issues.
However, not all systems connected to central servers require access to personal chance palace data; a number of privacy protection systems have also been created that use only central servers to communicate with each other (see below).
In South Korea, a non-application-based system was used to track contact.
Instead of using an excellent application, the system collects monitoring information from various sources, including monitoring data and data from cards in a mobile device, and collects all of them and generates notices through text messages for potentially affected people.
In addition to using this information, the government has made the Occasion Palace information publicly available to make possible connections, something that has been allowed due to far-reaching changes in information privacy laws when the MERS epidemic broke out in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites - countries such as Germany have also considered both central and privacy protection systems.
Details have not yet been released as of April 6, 2020.
As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth's weak energy (BLE) to allow the palace to be accessed by another mobile phone.
However, PEPP-PT is an integrated effort consisting of both central and non-central methods, and is not a standalone protocol. In non-central protocols: Non-Private Privacy Protection Location Monitoring (DP-PPT/DP-3T), including contact provisional numbers (TCN, fka event contact number, CEN), sensitive privacy.
These protocols do not exclude identifiable personal data from the device and all combinations are on the device.
The privacy group at the MIT Media Laboratory is developing a secure path that is a platform to use privacy protection techniques when collecting and using location or route intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research by the Quartas-Abuse "Eps Gon Rouge: Maintaining Personal Privacy in the Pandemic" released in March 2020. A similar effort is being made by Enigma MPC, a company developing privacy technology that was originally set up in the MIT Media Lab.
Safe Trace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials, without compromising the confidentiality of this data.
On April 5, 2020, the foundation of the Global TCN Alliance was laid by a number of groups that came together to achieve the same vision and broadly exceeded protocols to reduce dispersion to enable surveillance and intubation apps globally as a mutually beneficial enabler.
On April 9, 2020, Singapore's government announced that the Bluetrees application, which was used by its government, was freely sourced.
On April 10, 2020, Android and iOS mobile platform control companies, Google and Apple, announced a move to track communications, which, according to their claim, will protect privacy, based on a combination of weak Bluetooth energy technology and security privacy encryption.
He also published descriptions of the actual technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be implemented in three phases:
The implementation of these protocols will enable governments to issue official security privacy applications to detect the coronavirus.
Google and Apple plan to solve this permanent monitoring problem through direct integration into iOS and Android, first by sharing the system with the operating system updates, and then removing it in the same way as the threat is eliminated.
B. Drug replacement (also known as medication replacement, re-profiling, job altering, or treatment change) is the replacement or use of a medicine approved for the treatment of a disease, rather than the medicine used for the disease for which it was originally developed.
It is an online scientific research that is currently underway to research the effective and safe treatment of COVID-19.
Other directions of research include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and the transmission of obstructive plasma. SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 viable drug proteins, each of which has multiple disinfection sites.
The analysis of these immunization sites provides an appropriate plan to develop an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most promising target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like, such as RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, helices, S proteins, and ADP riboflavin, proteins.
Hussein A. A., et al., studied several candidate compounds, which were then reformed and analyzed with the highest approved drugs for the similarity of their DNA to accelerate the development of a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in its pre-medical study, suggesting it in the design of medical study.
Chloroquine is an anti-malarial drug used for some autoimmune diseases.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York's official experiments on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will begin on March 24. On March 28, F.D.H. allowed the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under an emergency use permit (EUA).
This treatment has not been approved by the FDA in the method of medical experiments and under its EUA, only emergency use is allowed for patients who are hospitalized but are not able to be treated in a medical experiment.
The CDC has said that "the use, dose, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of prophylaxis or SARS-CoV-2 disease has not yet been determined."
Doctors say they use these medications when "no other option remains".
In Istanbul, a Turkish research group is studying the use of chloroquine in conjunction with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Major studies are ongoing at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU Longoon Medical School is conducting an experiment on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydrochloroquine.
In experiments by China in Wuhan and Shenzhen, it was claimed that Favipiravir is "clearly" effective.
On average, in Shenzhen, 35 patients tested negative in 4 days, while in those 45 patients, the duration of the disease was 11 days.
Out of a study conducted on 240 pneumonia patients in Wuhan, half of the patients were given favipiravir and half were given amphetamine.
The Italian pharmaceutical agency reminded the public that the current evidence in support of the drug is very low and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for its stockpile, and use it through the military at university hospitals, where it will be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has dominated the Trump administration regarding the purchase of the drug - a drug that may be less effective in cases of severe illness where the virus has already spread.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or those who are trying to become pregnant.
A study on lupinavir/retinavir (Kelita), which is a compound of antiviral lupinavir and retinavir, has concluded that it has "not seen any benefit."
These drugs were designed in such a way that HIV was prevented from being replicated by binding to proteases.
A group of researchers at the University of Colorado are trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that will be associated with the proteases of SARS-CoV-2, which has been criticized in the scientific community for turning resources toward re-producing drugs, especially those developed for HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has included Lopinavir/Retinavir in the international coordination test.
Remdesivir was developed by Gilead Science to treat Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus disease, and the subsequent Glazed Science immediately discovered that Remdesivir has antiviral activity against a number of fellows, fomo, paramexo and coronaviruses.
One problem with antiviral treatment is the promotion of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious disease and transmission.
Some early pre-trial studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance; several such medical trials, including two managed by Cleveland University Hospital; one for people with low disease and the other for people with severe disease.
There are three clinical trials in the vein of vitamin C for serious patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19; two satisfaction-given control (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italian).
The state of New York began testing the azithromycin antibiotic on March 24, 2020.

The B'A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, several efforts are underway to develop such a vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine to be developed in accordance with SARS-CoV-2, which is why the virus vaccine will be available in less than 18 months.
As of April, five candidates for the vaccine were in Phase I safety study.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
In 2020, there was a major outbreak in the world, leading to considerable investment and research activities in the manufacture of a vaccine.
A number of companies are using the advertised loonie materials to develop a potential vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, it was said that the CEP's inevitable steps to develop the vaccine are accelerating, with the capacity of the developers, the deployment of large-scale and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were in research and development in early 2020 to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
A number of major platform goals in Phase I safety studies include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I manufacturers and vaccine candidates: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral Vector (Producers and Vaccine Candidate of Phase I: Kan Sino Biologics, Adenovirus Type 5 Vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 candidates for the vaccine are in the early stages of vaccine development, 78 are confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Melkin Institute), and 37 others announced but there is little public information available about them (it is believed that they are in the planning stage or are now being designed).
Phase I-II trials are preliminary safety and musculoskeletal tests, usually without order, controlled by the harmless substance of the drug, and on multiple sites, while determining more stable, effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and the effectiveness of vaccine testing for disease prevention, while monitoring the side effects on optimal doses.
Of the 79 candidates for the vaccine in active preparation (now certified as early as April 2020), 74 were not yet diagnosed in humans (in "pre-medical" research).
On January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland announced it was investigating the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically alter viral proteins and boost an immune response.

On 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Innovative Preparedness of the Pandemic (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in the COVID-19 Vaccine Research Consortium comprising the Institute of Pasteurs, Themes Biosciences (Vina, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, with the CEPI's total investment of US$29 million in COVID-19 vaccine development.
Other CEPI partners in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine include Moderna, Corey Walk, Innova, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, Oxford University and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing various vaccine candidates on animals.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-developing RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the order from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced a $275 million Canadian funding for 96 research projects on COVID-19 response medical issues, including a number of vaccine candidates in measures by Canadian companies and universities, such as the University of Saskatchewan and the University of Suskatchewan.
At the same time, the Canadian government announced a special 192 million Canadian dollars for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, with several new vaccines planned to be used when a second outbreak of the coronavirus has occurred.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the Peters Bridge School of Medicine reported experiments on Patkovic, which could be a potential COVID-19 virus in mice, saying that "MNA showed strong antigen-related antibody reactions through the SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccine [in the four] that clearly showed up 2 weeks after being vaccinated."
On April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy in Canada announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine as a possible nose spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to replicate the harmless virus-like particles inside human bacteria, which strengthens the immune system of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three universities collected resources to access IBM's supercomputers, which will be combined with Heliot-Packard Enterprises, Amazon, Microsoft and Google's Cloud Computing resources.
Some vaccines have different effects, also known as nonspecific effects.
This means that they can also have other benefits besides the disease they want to avoid.
A total of 4,170 medical staff are being enrolled in Australia for another randomized trial.
The vaccine may not be safe or effective in the development phase.
Initial research to test the efficacy of the vaccine using specific animal specimens of COVID-19, such as ACE2-dominant rats, other laboratory animals and non-human high creatures, biological protection level 3 preventive measures to combat the virus directly, and identify the need for international coordination to ensure standard protection procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in nonhuman animal models.
As of 2020, no vaccine or treatment for SARS has been found that is safe and effective in humans.
According to a research paper published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and manufacture of novel vaccines and medicines for the treatment of SARS has been a priority for governments and public institutions around the world.
When MERS was first launched, it was thought that the existing SARS research would be an effective model in the treatment of MERS-CoV disease and the manufacture of vaccines.
As of March 2020, there was one MERS vaccine (DNA-based) that completed phase I clinical trials on humans and three more ongoing, all of which were vector-borne viral vaccines, two adenoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS-GAMVac), and one.
Social media posts have promoted a conspiracy theory that the virus of COVID-19 is known and its vaccine is already available.
In various posts on social media, the patents indicated the existing patents of genetics and vaccines, and the second cell of the coronavirus, such as the SARS coronavirus.
B'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe respiratory illness coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms include vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell, and abdominal pain.
From appearance to the onset of symptoms, it usually takes five days, but can last from two to four days.
Although in most cases the symptoms of the disease are of a minor nature, some go to viral pneumonia and organ failure.
As on 17th April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported from 210 countries and territories, resulting in 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been diagnosed with the virus, mainly in close contact with people, often in the form of mouth-to-mouth droplets when coughing, sneezing, or talking.
Although similar droplets come out when exhaling, they often fall on the ground or on the floor, rather than being able to spread the disease over long distances.
People can also suffer from this disease by touching their hands, nose or mouth after touching the affected surface.
The virus can survive for up to 72 hours.
It is the most contagious disease within three days before the onset of symptoms, although it is also possible to spread before the onset of symptoms and in the later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is the timely reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
The use of masks is advised to people who are suspected to be infected with the virus and to people with health problems.
There is a difference in the suggestion of wearing masks for the general public, some officials are against its use, some recommend its use and some are calling it necessary.
There is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries of all the regions of the World Health Organization.
People infected with the virus may not show symptoms or show symptoms such as fever, cough, sneezing, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include shortness of breath, frequent pain or pressure in the chest, mental illness, difficulty waking up, and blueness of the face or lips; it is advisable to seek immediate medical attention if these symptoms are present.
In the upper part of the respiratory tract, symptoms such as sneezing, sneezing or sore throat can also be seen.
Symptoms of gastrointestinal diseases such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea were observed in different percentages.
In China, there were only a few cases of chest tightness and sneezing.
In some cases, the disease can lead to pneumonia, more organ failure and death.
This is known as the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to four days, but may also be two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who show symptoms of the disease will do so within 11.5 days of the infection.
These people with no symptoms are not yet fully known; however, early evidence suggests they may be contagious.
The proportion of people infected with the disease is currently unknown and is being studied, where the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases during hospital stay were without symptoms.
China's National Health Commission began counting symptomatic cases in its daily cases from April 1; 130 (78%) of the 166 infected patients on that day were unvaccinated at the time of testing.
The viral load can be higher in both Thowk and Bulgaria.
Talking in a loud voice is more of a boon than a normal conversation.
A study in Singapore found that droplets of dahnpe can travel up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) without a dahnpe.
Although the virus is not airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that bioreceptive transfers are possible and viral RNA samples have been found to be positive in accumulating air in the hallways outside individuals' rooms.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can aerosolize the respiratory tract and can result in airborne transmission.
Now that the concern is that it is spread by waste, the risk is considered low. When symptoms appear in people, the virus is most contagious; and if the virus is possible before symptoms appear, the risk is less.
The European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) says that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person usually infects two to three people.
In particular, one day on virus cardboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and rusted steel (AISI 304), and 99% on copper was found to be viable for four hours.
However, it keeps changing in terms of humidity and temperature.
If soaps and detergents are used correctly, they are effective; soap products make the thickening layer of the virus ineffective, at the same time they cleanse the virus from skin and other surfaces.
Other molecules, such as Heise Benzkonium Chloride and Chloroquine gluconate (a surgical germ) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, on average two days after hospitalization, samples of saliva were taken.
Among the six patients, the first sample saw the highest viral load, and the sixth patient saw the highest amount of virus in the second day's test.
Symptoms of severe respiratory distress are coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) severe novel respiratory disease coronavirus, which was first discovered in Wuhan in three people with severe respiratory diseases with pneumonia.
All the characteristics of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the respective coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which breaks its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the original SARS-CoV.
First, they are the organs that are most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses these host cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most commonly found in the type II cells of the lungs.
To connect the virus to ACE2, a special level of thankfulness called "cell" (popular) is used, and enters the host cell.
12% of those hospitalized in Wuhan, China, had a severe heart attack and are frequently found in severe illness.
The rate of heart symptoms is high due to immune system diseases during inflammation and disease progression throughout the body, but severe heart muscle injury may also be associated with ACE2 inhibitors.
2ACE is more pronounced in the heart and it is involved in the function of the heart.
Patients with intensive care unit infected with COVID-19 saw higher incidences of blood clots (31%) and thromboembolism (25%) in Sri Lanka and may be associated with poor diagnosis.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has side effects for the appearance of ACE2 respiratory tract cervical cells, severe patients with COVID-19 have more inflammatory symptoms than usual affecting the body.
In particular, T-cells with sickly SM-CSF-sequencing were found to be ingested in COVID-19-affected patients with inflammatory IL-6 inflammatory bowel disease and associated with acute lung diseases.
There have also been reports of long-term cell interference at the time of post mortem.
The WHO has published several methods of testing for the disease.
The standard method of experiments is the timely reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually done on samples of inhaled inhalation obtained from the skin; however, the nasal swab or saliva can also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
A blood test can be used, but it requires two samples to be taken in two weeks and the immediate significance of the results is low.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a variant of the coronavirus and publish a genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reactions (PCR) to detect infectious diseases caused by varicose veins.
As of April 4, 2020, the antibodies test (which detects active infectious disease and whether or not someone has been infected in the past) was in the preparation stages, but is not yet widely used.
The Chinese test showed only 60% to 70% accuracy.
The FDA approved the first test center of care for end-of-month use in the US on March 21, 2020, and the Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital issued diagnostic guidelines for the detection of the disease, taking into account the medical characteristics and the risk of the pandemic.
In the early infectious disease, bipolar multicellular, ground-glass opiates, improper, and later-divided opioids are common.
As the disease progresses, full-blown, crispy pungs (the thickening of the spherical hijab may appear as if it were deformed) and stability may appear.
There are some statistics available about the microorganisms and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main desirable results on the post-mortem are:
Macroscopie: Inflammation of the lung membrane, inflammation of the cover heart, stability of the lungs and swelling of the lungs.
There are four types of viral pneumonia:
Mild pneumonia: a swelling of the lungs, a greater build-up of neemocytes, large abnormal neemocytes, with the infiltration of lymphocytes, the formation of inflammatory and multicellular ovarian cells.
Severe Pneumonia: Reduced loss of appetite (DAD) by chewing.
D.A. Fear is a manifestation of severe respiratory distress symptoms (ARDS) and a severe lack of oxygen in the body.
Pneumonia: the organization of external decomposition in the eucalyptus cavity and pulmonary pulmonary fibrillation
Blood: Blood clotted in the veins (DIC); white and red blood reactions.
Precautions to reduce the chances of disease include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water, and washing hands for at least 20 seconds, practicing better respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing, and the use of the inside of the chin if the tissue is not available.
Proper hygienic use of the hand is encouraged after sneezing or sneezing.
The CDC suggested the use of cloth to cover the crowd to limit the spread of the virus from people who do not show symptoms, and social distancing strategies aimed at closing schools and offices, imposing travel restrictions, and cancelling large public gatherings to reduce contact with large groups of people affected.
The distance guidelines also include staying at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) away from people.
Since vaccines are not expected before 2021, one of the key points to curbing COVID-19 is to reduce the highest levels of the epidemic known as "Flatring de Kro."
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands are obviously dirty, before eating and after cleaning the nose, coughing or sneezing.
It further suggests that at least 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizer should be used, but only when soap and water are not readily available. In areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, WHO formulates two formulas for local production.
In these formations, anti-microbial activity, ethanol and estoppel are produced.
In alcohol, hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial plaques; it is "not an active substance for dafa germs in the hands."
Glycerol is poured as a margarine.
People have been organized with supportive care, including celiac treatment, oxygen support, and support for other important affected organs.
The CDC recommends that people who are suspected of being infected with the virus wear a simple mask.
An ECMO has been used to solve the problem of respiratory obstruction, but its benefits are still under consideration.
It has been suggested to improve personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and better diet immunity.
Supportive treatments may be used in people with mild symptoms in the early stages of the pandemic, the WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of hospitalizations with COVID-19.
Physicians and lung doctors in the U.S. have set up a free resource, the IBC, with treatment proposals from various agencies.
As of April 2020, there was no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical experts suggested paracetamol (mistaminophane) as an important drug in place of aibioprofen.
To minimise the risk of the spread of the virus, it is necessary to take precautions, especially in the medical environment when there is a medical process that leads to inflammation such as an abdominal tube or hand blowing.
For medical personnel caring for people affected by COVID-19, the CDC recommends general precautions, contact precautions and precautions for airborne germs, as well as keeping the person in the Airborne Infection Room (AIIR).
The recommended equipment is: PPE gowns, device respirators or face masks, eye protectors, and medical gloves. Respirators are preferred (instead of face masks) when available.
The N95 device has been approved for industrial environments, but the FDA has allowed the mask to be used only under emergency use authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but they do not guarantee the effect of use against any particular unapproved biological agent.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face shields or homemade masks, as a last resort.
People infected with COVID-19 are often not so bad that they need mechanical diffusion or replacement, but only a few percent of patients require it.
The type of respiratory support in hospitalized people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being actively studied, with some evidence that a high-flowing nasal cannula or bidirectional positive airway can be avoided with an inlet duct.
It is not known whether either of these two gives the same benefit to severely ill people.
Some doctors prefer unpleasant mechanical rashes when available because this method limits the spread of windy particles compared to the cannula of the high-flow nose. Severe illness is more common in older adults (those who are older than 60 years and especially those who are older than 80 years).
In developed countries, there is no adequate bed per capita, which limits the ability to handle people who need to be hospitalized with COVID-19 in the health system.
According to one study, 5% were admitted to the intensive care unit in China, 2.3% needed mechanized ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, 30% of people infected with COVID-19 are finally admitted to the intensive care unit.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as COVID-19 increases acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and oxygen becomes increasingly difficult.
Pressure-controlled mode and high PEEP-enabled ventilators need to minimize the risk of excessive oxygen transmission and damage to the lungs associated with ventilators and air incubation in the chest.
No more PEPs will be available on older ventilators.
Research for potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in the clinical trial phase.
Remdesivir seems to be the most optimistic.
Although it may take until 2021 to develop new drugs, many of the drugs that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in the advanced testing phase.
Antiviral drugs can be tested in people with severe illness.
The FDA recommends that volunteers participate in potential therapeutic effectiveness and safety experiments, allowing artificially cured individuals to experiment in cases where a person's life is at serious or immediate risk.
It did not go through medical studies to show that it was safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to prevent the spread of the disease.
The user will be asked to enter his/her name and ID number.
This app can detect "close contact" using surveillance numbers and therefore indicate a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also view the status of three other users.
If possible, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but also alerts local medical officials, using mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, tracking mobile phones, and large data analytics on artificial intelligence to track the victims and those who have been in contact with them in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track mobile phone data of people who should have coronavirus.
The move was taken to prevent and protect those who are in contact with the affected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom segmented the data collected by the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, with the location of the mobile phone to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia deploys facial recognition technology to detect quarantine breakers.
The Italian regional health administrator said he was informed by mobile phone operators that "40% of people are still moving around."
The German government held a 48-hour weekend hackathon with 42,000 candidates.
Estonian President Christy Kjollide has also voiced internationally for creative solutions to the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may have difficulties due to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of the pandemic itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "More social distancing, isolation, health care, stress, and economic downturns are a complete disaster for people's mental health and well-being."
The disease can take a lighter side with or without any symptoms, which is similar to other common respiratory diseases such as a common fever.
Usually, patients recover within two weeks, while patients with severe or severe illnesses recover within three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may also be at greater risk from COVID-19 based on data from other viruses such as SARS and MERS, but COVID-19 data is not available.
In severely affected people, COVID-19 can quickly turn into acute respiratory illness (ARDS) that can lead to respiratory failure, body mold, or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include body mold, abnormal blood clotting and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Extraordinary blood clots, especially in 6% of COVID-19 patients, were found to have a longer period of blood fertilization, while kidney failure was seen in 4% of patients in the group.
About 20-30% of people affected by COVID-19 showed higher levels of liver enzymes.
According to the same document, the time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, of which five days were spent in the hospital.
However, among the patients transferred to the intensive care unit, the average time between hospitalization and death was seven days.
In one study of early patients, the median period from the appearance of early symptoms to death was 14 days, while the full series was six to 41 days.
In a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), the mortality rate in men was 2.8%, while the mortality rate in women was 1.7 percent.
After a medical examination of the dead lung, the damage was seen spread with the beard of fibromyalgia in small oils for the presence of air in the lungs.
Changes related to animal virus cell disease have been observed in pneumococcals.
The image of the lungs is similar to the symptoms of acute respiratory distress (ARDC).
According to China's National Health Commission, 11.8 deaths were observed due to elevated levels of troponin or heart.
According to the U.S. March figures, 89% of hospitalised patients already had certain illnesses, and the availability of medical resources and the region's socioeconomics could also have an impact on mortality rates.
The rate of mortality varies due to regional variations, but it can also be due to difficulties in the procedure.
A low mortality rate can lead to a higher mortality rate.
However, the fact that these deaths are the result of diseases that already have it, means that the current mortality rate is low.
Cigarette smokers had a 1.4-fold higher incidence of severe symptoms of COVID-19, and the need for extreme care or mortality rate was 2.4 times higher than those who did not smoke.
The management of the Hong Kong Hospital saw a 20% to 30% reduction in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung examinations indicated organ damage.
This can lead to the appearance of very careful symptoms after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether it had long-term immunity to people who had recovered from the previous pandemic.
Immunizations are likely to be seen based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but there have also been cases that have shown positive results from the coronavirus again after recovering from COVID-19.
These cases are thought to be getting worse due to a long-lived infectious disease rather than a re-infected disease.
The virus is thought to be natural and originated as an animal-infected disease.
The exact source is not known, but by December 2019, the spread of the pandemic was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in Lancet in January 2020, showed that the first case of symptoms appeared on December 1, 2019.
WHO official publications reported on December 8, 2019 being the first date of the onset of the disease.
A number of steps are usually taken to determine the cause of death.
These numbers vary by region and over time and affect the number of tests carried out, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time since the onset of the outbreak, and the characteristics of the population such as age, sex, and overall health factors.
At the end of 2019, the WHO assigned the laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pandemic deaths to the emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 and the lab assigned the number of medical or epidemiological deaths from COVID-19 to U07.2 without confirming the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the proportion of global deaths and incidents as of 17 April 2020 is now 6.9 (153,822/2,240,191).
Other measures include the Case Fatality Rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of deaths among confirmed individuals, and the Epidemic Mortality Rate (IFR) which reflects the percentage of deaths among infected people (confirmed and unconfirmed).
These statistics do not cover a specific time period and cover a specific population from disease to case resolution.
Although antibodies are not visible in all infected people, the presence of antibodies can provide information on how many people have been infected.
A small village with a population of 4600 in the epicentre of the epidemic in Italy, Castaglian de Ada, with 80 (1.7%) people already dead.
In Glasgow, the disease spread due to Catholic Christian festivals, and spread to younger people, with relatively low mortality rates, and not necessarily all deaths from COVID-19 have been classified in this way.
Moreover, Germany's health system has not been defeated.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of patients may have antibodies, as estimated by blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) people have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact and mortality rates of the pandemic are different for men and women.
Studies conducted in China and Italy have a higher mortality rate among men.
The highest risk in men is after the age of 50, while the difference between men and women ends at just 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact cause of this gender difference is not known, but genetic and behavioral factors can be a cause.
Gender-based immunological variations, low consumption of tobacco in women and men, and the birth of other diseases compared to women in men, such as high blood pressure at a young age, may lead to an increase in mortality among men.
In Europe, 57 per cent of those infected were men, and 72 per cent of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government has not been able to find out the sex ratio of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS affect men and women in a holistic manner.
A higher percentage of medical staff, especially nurses, are women, and they are at a higher risk of being infected with the virus.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease was "COVID-19."
WHO President Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that COVID-19, VI to virus, D to disease, and 19 to the day when the first case appeared: December 31, 2019.
The name has been chosen to avoid reference to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), animal type, or group of people, taking into account international recommendations to prevent stigmatization.
WHO additionally uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public correspondence.
Both disease and varicose veins are commonly referred to as "coronavirus Iris".
During the initial outbreak of the epidemic in Wuhan, China, both the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and " Wuhan virus".
In January 2020, the WHO proposed nCoV-2019 and nCoV-2019 as an interim name for the virus and disease, in line with the 2015 directive against using the location name in the name of disease and virus.
On 11 February 2020, the official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released.
Due to the capacity limitations of the standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are chewing medical equipment such as the needles inserted in the nose and the parts of the ventilator.
In one example, when an Italian hospital needed a ventilator valve, and the seller was not able to deliver it in the required time, a local craftsman copied it and made the required 100 valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misconceptions about the onset of the disease, duration, prevention, treatment and other precursors, emerged and quickly spread to the Internet.
Humans can spread the virus to other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral growth in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines are approved for the treatment of the disease.
Research on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines is underway by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a "solidarity experiment" to assess the effects of treatment from the four most effective existing antiviral compounds.
There is no vaccine available, but various institutions are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous research on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the same source to enter the ACE2 human cell.
Three vaccines are under investigation.
First, the researchers aim to develop vaccines for the whole virus.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, creates an immediate immune system in the human body against the new COVID-19 disease.
Another strategy, the subjunctive vaccine, is to develop a vaccine that is sensitive to certain subcomponents of the virus in the immune system.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the focus of such research is the S spike protein, which helps the virus to enter the enzyme membrane of ACE2.
The third strategy is the nuclear-acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccines, a novel way of developing the vaccine).
These strategies will be tested for the safety and efficacy of the experimental vaccine - the first clinical trial of the vaccine was launched on March 16, 2020 at four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine consists of a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. An antibody-dependent booster in the preparation of the vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 has been suggested as a potential challenge, but it is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials have been conducted.
Seven experiments are testing a drug that is already approved for malaria, including four studies of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The majority of Chinese research consists of recombined antiviral drugs, with nine Phase III experiments on remdesivir being reported in several countries by the end of April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review process for candidates for the development and use of a COVID-19 vaccine has been underway. Several existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxy chloroquine, have been tested with Lupinavir/Rtnavier and Lupinavir/Rtnovir which have been tested.
As of March 2020, there is temporary evidence of efficacy from Remdesivir.
Medical improvements have been observed in patients treated with low use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy, and chloroquine, which was previously used to treat malaria, was studied in February 2020 with preliminary results.
However, we are still waiting for the results of the research.
The medical administration of Korea and China suggested the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, although recommends one gram of daily food, reminds that double doses of the drug can be extremely dangerous and deadly.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency permit for doctors who are engaged in the treatment of COVID-19 patients to use hydrochloroquine and chloroquine at their discretion.
Initial data suggest that higher amounts of robavirin are necessary to prevent SARS-CoV-2 within the organism.
Nitazazacinide has been recommended for further vitro studies after showing a low concentration in the prevention of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that ACE2 is essential for entry into the SARS-CoV-2 receptor through interaction with the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMRS2).
chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without acetromycin are major barriers in the study that have prevented the medical community from accepting this treatment without further study.
The cytokine stroke can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine is a characteristic of the anti-cytokine Strom, which was added to the treatment instructions by China's National Health Commission after a brief study.
Italy is undergoing a national phase 2 randomized test after showing positive results in people with severe illness.
The joint serum ferritin blood test is intended to identify the citokine Strom, which is believed to be the cause of death in some infected people.
In 2017, the FDA approved a steroid refractory cytokine release for the treatment of the disease for a different cause, i.e., CART cell treatment, based on past-style studies.
To date, there is no random, inaccurate evidence that toxylzumab is an effective treatment against CRS.
Clean and concentrated antibodies developed by the immune system of people who have recovered from COVID-19 are being researched as a passive vaccine inactivated antibodies to those who need them.
This strategy was tested with unspecified results for SARS.
Viral neutralization is an expected method by which inactive antibody treatment can lead to defense against SARS-CoV-2.
Other procedures, however, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or figusetosis, may be possible.
Other forms of inactive antibody treatment, for example, the use of palliative monoclonal antibody, are being worked on.
The production of obstetric fluid, which is a liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and consists of specific antibodies to the virus, can be quickly developed for use.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wen Lang, a doctor at Wuhan's main hospital, was infected after raising awareness about the spread of the virus and died due to COVID-19.
