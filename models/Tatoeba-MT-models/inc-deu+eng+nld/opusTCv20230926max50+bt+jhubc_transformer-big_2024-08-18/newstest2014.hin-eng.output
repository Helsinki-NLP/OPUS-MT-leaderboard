A black box in your car?
While U.S. road planners are struggling with a lack of funds to improve the collapsed highway system, many are looking for a solution in a small black box that fits neatly on your car’s dashboard.
The device, which tracks every mile driven by a motorist and transmits that information to authorities, has become a controversial effort for Washington and the State Planning Office to restore the old system to finance major U.S. roads.
In general, boring work like highway planning has also suddenly become an issue of intense debate and vibrant alliances.
Keeping details of the miles you drive, and possibly the location you drive – and then using this information to prepare tax bills – has teamed up with Libertarian environmental groups to raise support in favor of allowing the government to use these black boxes.
The Tea Party is amazing.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned by raising a variety of privacy issues.
While the Congress could not agree on whether to take further action or not, many states are not waiting.
They are exploring how they can move into a system over the next decade, in which the driver pays for every mile fixed on the road.
Thousands of motorists have already taken the black box for test drives, some of which have GPS monitoring.
This is really an essential thing for our country.
"It's not a matter of choosing or not being chosen by us," says Hassan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Government Association, who plans to begin tracking every mile determined by motorists in California by 2025.
There is going to be a change in the way we pay taxes.
There is technology to do that.
The main reason for this is that the country's highway trust fund has almost been bankrupt, funded by the payment of taxes on gas pumps by U.S. citizens.
Americans don’t buy gas as much as they used to.
Now the car in a gallon of gas runs more miles than ever before.
There has been no increase in federal taxes in the last 20 years, which is 18.4 cents per gallon.
Due to the high price of gas, politicians refrain from raising even a penny in tax.
"Gas tax is absolutely not sustainable," says transportation policy expert Lee Munik, at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently installed tracking devices in 500 cars to test the per-mile payment system.
"In the long run it will serve as the most logical option," he says.
WAN<0x58> calls it a mileage-based user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea seems good to urban liberals, as it could lead to changes in taxes, for example, to change the mode of driving, which can help reduce jams and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
California planners are eager for this system while they are developing strategies to meet the goals set out in the state's ambitious global warming laws.
But the chairman of the Home Transport Committee, Rip. Bill Schuster (I-PA), also considers the black box to be the most viable long-term option.
Independent sellers in the Region Foundation are also in favour of payment per mile by the driver.
Adrian Moore, vice president of policy in the region, said, “It’s not the only thing that’s going into the blind well.”
People are paying more directly for what they are getting.
The campaign has also been supported by two former U.S. transport secretaries who, in their 2011 report, graced the move to pay per-mile from Congress.
The U.S. Senate approved a 90-million-dollar test project last year, which would have involved 10,000 cars.
But while working on the concerns of the rural law makers who were representing persons who had to walk too many miles to go to work or to the city every day, the leadership of the House overruled the proposal there.
Yet many states and cities themselves are moving in this direction.
It has the most interested Oregon, which has listed 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay mileage charges instead of gas tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed its initial testing.
New York City is also moving in that direction.
Illinois is testing with trucks on a limited basis.
And the I-95 alliance, which includes 17 state transport departments (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) along the Eastern Seaboard, is studying how they can implement this change.
This idea did not get support everywhere.
In Nevada, where the device was recently installed on cars of 50 voluntary car drivers, the drivers were too impatient to think that the government could monitor their every move.
Alauddin Khan, who directs strategic and performance management in the Nevada Department of Transportation, says “The concern about Big Brother and other similar things was the major problem.”
This is not something that people wanted.
As the trial progressed, Nevada’s ACLU warned on its website: “It will be fairly easy to convert these devices to full tracking devices.”
There is no need to develop a vast, unmanaged technology infrastructure, which must be disseminated to keep a record of every person's daily movement.
Nevada is among the many states that are making every effort to get affordable technology, with the help of which the state can get details of how many miles the car is running per day, but not where and at what time it is running.
Khan said that if you can do that, people can feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small California start-up called True Mileage.
This firm was not originally in the business of assisting state tax drivers.
It was attempting to enter the emerging market of auto insurance, in which drivers had to pay based on their mileage.
But the device it is testing was well liked by highway planners, as it does not use GPS and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by modems at fixed time intervals.
“If you don’t track people’s speed and their location, they’ll be more willing to adopt this method,” said Rayan Morrison, chief executive of True Mileage.
There have been some major mistakes in these initial programmes of the state.
There are also very few expensive and less meddling ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are using different options for drivers.
They can choose a GPS device with or without GPS.
Or again can choose not to take any device, but to pay the prescribed fee based on the average miles to be decided by the residents of the state.
Other places hope that this retention can be sold to concerned citizens by providing more convenience rather than less in the device.
In New York City, transport officials are trying to develop a taxing device that will also have the facility to pay parking meter fees, provide "pay according to your drive" insurance, and create a collection of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists will be able to use to avoid traffic.
The city planning document mentions, “motor-drivers will be attracted to participation in it because of the benefits it derives from it.”
However, some transport planners wonder that perhaps the whole discussion on payment according to miles is a big distraction.
The Metropolitan Transport Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area has said that Congress can deal with the problem of insolvent highway trust funds very easily by increasing gas tax.
An additional one-time or annual fee may also be levied on drivers of hybrid or other cars whose vehicles do not use too much gas to pay their fair share.
"What is the need for radical surgery when aspirin can work," said Randy Rentsheller, the Commission's Director of Legislation and Public Affairs.
If we do this, millions of car drivers will be worried about their privacy and many other things.
According to the police, he died due to drowning.
However, his friend has been detained by the police on charges of concealing the body of the deceased.
The police have handed over the final report of the death to the court.
On August 26, police recovered the body of Zahid Iqbal, a resident of Padshahi Bagh in Jhelum Darya.
His family had accused his friends of killing him as his mobile and other belongings were missing.
In the report, the police said that the phone and SIM of the deceased were examined and it was found that his phone was being used by a woman in Soura.
During interrogation, the woman said she was given the phone by her relative, Ruhul Gauhar.
Ruhul also lives in the Padshahi garden and was a friend of the late Zahid.
Ruhul had gone to Jhelum with Zahid after Namaz-e-Jumma on August 25.
Zahid opened his clothes and put all his belongings on the shore, while Ruhail went the other way to smoke cigarettes.
When he came back, Zahid was not there, only his clothes.
Ruhul searched for Zahid, but he could not be found.
He picked up his mobile phone, watch and other items and kept them for his own use.
He didn't tell anyone that he had drowned.
The police told the court that Zahid died of drowning and the post-mortem has also confirmed it.
However, Ruhul has been detained under Section 404 for concealing the facts and the belongings of the deceased.

MRF awarded JD Power Award for 10th consecutive time
Chandigarh: MRF, India's largest tyre manufacturer and one of the top 15 global tyre companies, has been awarded the JD Power Award for the tenth consecutive time.
The award is widely regarded as an Oscar equivalent by peers in the automotive sector and holds the highest recognition in the industry.

Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, 77, has married a 28-year-old girl in an extremely secretive way.
This was revealed by his family friend, Martel Polanco.
According to him, three-time Prime Minister Berlusconi has married former TV anchor Francisca Pascal in his private chapel.
Francisca met Baluskoni when she was a teenager activist at the Forza Italia party.
It is Francesca, whose relationship was being said that their relationship with Baluskoni is just a show-off.
Berlusconi's close friend and Bunga-Bunga girl Marthale Polanco has revealed that she was also invited to this intelligence wedding.
The event took place three weeks ago.
When asked what would happen if the two got married, Polanco said they were already married.
It was not a public event.
The wedding took place in a private chapel in the former Prime Minister's house.
Nothing else can be said.
However, he did not attend the wedding.
He has sent his congratulations to the newlyweds.
The couple got married about three weeks ago on October 8 or 9.
About eight months ago, a 28-year-old woman, 50 years younger than herself, got engaged to Francesca Pascal.
In order to avoid Kirkiri, Berlusconi had formed the basis of loneliness behind his decision.
The low-lying areas also witnessed intermittent rain.
With this, cold wave has started in the entire plaint.
The minimum temperature was recorded at 4.8 degrees Celsius in Srinagar, minus -0.2 degrees in Gulmarg and 1.8 degrees Celsius in Leh.
Leh was the coldest in the state.
The Srinagar-Leh national highway has been closed for traffic due to heavy rains and snowfall.
There is a heavy snowfall on the Jojila Pass.
This is the fourth and first heavy snowfall of this season in the hilly areas of Kashmir.
Due to the activism of the Western Disturbance, heavy snowfall in the high mountainous areas of the plains began in the early morning and rain in the lowlands continued till late evening.
Normal life was also affected by the cold.
People stayed at home to avoid the cold.
Meanwhile, power supply was disrupted in many areas.
Srinagar's maximum temperature was recorded at 13.7 degrees Celsius, four notches below normal.
In Jammu and Kashmir too, the temperature rose sharply due to heavy rains in the morning and evening.
The minimum temperature was recorded at 16.6 degrees Celsius while the maximum was recorded at 27.0 degrees Celsius.
According to the Meteorological Department, the impact of the Western Disturbance has started to decrease and the weather will improve from Friday.
According to Sonam Lots, director of the Srinagar-based Meteorological Department, the weather is likely to remain dry from November 1 to November 7.
Asaram, who is lodged in jail on charges of sexual harassment, on Friday again faced disappointment from the Supreme Court.
In the media coverage argued by Asaram, he is being portrayed as a children's blood drinker Dracula, but the court rejected his demand for a ban on media coverage.
A bench of Chief Justice P Sathasivam refused to order the media to stop reporting on Asaram, saying they have seen every word reported in the media and see no reason to interfere in it.
How can we stop them when they are receiving those information from the police and others.
Earlier, Asaram's lawyer accused the media of spreading rumours about him.
There are so many newspapers and channels in the country.
They should file a case against whom, but the bench was not impressed by these arguments and refused to interfere in the matter, saying they have other options.
Earlier, the court had rejected Asaram's demand for a ban on media coverage.
Officials of the department claim that this is the largest TDS theft case to date.
The group operator of the mall paid TDS to the concerned financial institutions but did not pay it in the government exchequer.
By doing this, the TDS kept depositing the money to itself.
The group was launched on October 17 by the Mumbai-based investigation team in collaboration with the Jaipur investigation team.
The investigation revealed that the trader had deducted TDS but did not deposit it.
For this reason, the TDS team had started the Income Tax Survey on this group on Thursday.
About 15 days ago, the group of the mall operator was raided and surveyed.
Aggrieved by the action, the trader has made it clear to the Income Tax department officials that he is not yet ready to pay TDS money to the Income Tax department.
The Income Tax Department is constantly targeting them and taking action.
The officials probing the case have made it clear that in case of non-payment, the recovery action will be taken by sealing the account.
With the advent of Diwali, the demand for sweets is increasing.
As a result of this, the sale of cheap and fake Mave has increased.
Chemicals are used to make sweets more shiny, colorful and sweet, which is dangerous to health.
The Department of Food and Drug Administration has launched a campaign against fake mawa and chemical sweets.
The department seized Rs 70,000 from Madhya Pradesh and Rs 5,000 from Quetta Colony.
With the demand for sweets in the market, the demand for cheap maize from Madhya Pradesh has also increased.
The department was informed to bring the dirty mave from Madhya Pradesh to Nagpur.
The consignment of Mave is being moved to Nagpur from the transport garage.
The department has taken possession of the mave, which was valued at Rs 70,000.
The fear of action did not entitle anyone to take action.
The department destroyed it by treating it as unclaimed (unclaimed) property.
The department raided the Jeetendra caterers at Quetta Colony and recovered around 5,000 glazes.
A chemical called sodium hydrosulfite was used to brighten and last for a long time.
The sample will be sent to the laboratory.
S S Deshmukh, Joint Commissioner of the department, said that the operation to arrest the chemically-contained sweets and substandard and fake mave will continue.
In the next few days, the department has given information about the operation and speeding up.
The consumption of these sweets can also cause poisoning.
The department asked the sweet traders to make sweets from good milk, mawe.
The department has appealed to the people to be careful of fake sweets and Mave.
He was received at the airport by 42 senior BJP leaders.
Modi is on a state visit to Bihar to attend a BJP-led state meet.
The rally is being organised by the BJP to provide relief to the families of those who lost their lives in the blasts in Patna.
A total of seven blasts took place in Patna on October 27 during Narendra Modi's Hunkar rally.
The intention of the Indian Mujahideen terrorists involved in the blasts was to create a stampede during the rally so that more and more people were killed and there was an atmosphere of terror in the state.
The terrorists did not succeed, but six people were killed in the blasts.
All of them have been declared martyrs by the BJP.
The leaders of the party have been on a visit from their village since Thursday.
On November 5, the ashes of all of them will be flown together in the Ganga in Patna.
As a part of this journey, a consoling journey is organized.
Its main character is Narendra Modi.
He will go to the village of the victims of the blasts on Saturday morning and meet their families.
During the meeting, he will also provide a cheque of five rupees each to the next of kin of the deceased.
This financial assistance has already been announced by the BJP.
The Indian team will look to take on Australia in the seventh and final ODI at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday.
After two consecutive ODIs washed out due to rain, India had to win the Nagpur ODI series in any case and its batsmen gave it a record win with a bang, giving the team a 2-2 lead in the series.
In the series, Team India has achieved the target of more than 350 twice and once again it will be the responsibility of the batsmen to cross the line.
India's batting is at an all-time high and the bigger target is also proving to be dwarf in front of him.
Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in great form, but Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja will also have high hopes for the team.
As far as opening is concerned, Rohit and Shikhar have got such an opening pair which is making the job of the rest of the batsmen easier with a solid partnership.
In Jaipur and Nagpur, he made a brilliant opening partnership, giving Virat a chance to play without any pressure.
The Virat Kohli-led side is considered to be the future of Sachin Tendulkar.
In fact, many cricket pundits have described him as better than Sachin.
Virat Kohli, who turns 25 next week, has scored 17 ODI centuries, out of which India have won 16.
Chasing the target, his average is above 80.00 and he has emerged as the best finisher.
India's top three batsmen are in strong form, but excessive reliance on these three can also be detrimental to the team.
Raina and Yuvraj were in a bad mood in the last match.
Yuvraj has not been able to open an account in two matches in the series.
In such a situation, a good innings in Bangalore ODI can work 'lifeline' for him.
As far as Australia is concerned, his batsmen, especially captain George Bailey, have impressed everyone with his performance.
He is also being sought to be included in the Test squad for the home Ashes series against England.
Australia have good batsmen up to number nine.
Apart from Bailey, Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Adam Voggs and James Faulkner have batted well in the series.
However, Phil Hughes and Aaron Finch have not been able to make an impact in the opening innings.
The lack of Mitchell Johnson in bowling can be a big blow for Australia.
Johnson, who has performed brilliantly so far in the series, has been sent home for the Ashes series preparations.
BJP national executive member and chief spokesperson Dr Jitendra Singh said that Pakistan is working on a new policy to infiltrate terrorists under the guise of this provocative peace.
Quoting reports from intelligence agencies, Singh said in a statement issued to Veerwar that Pakistan is pushing the heel to infiltrate around 2000 terrorists in its training camps.
For this, he will never let there be peace on the border.
Pakistan has been on the boil ever since the separatists failed to plan to destabilise the situation in Kashmir on a large scale.
Referring to last year's visit to Pakistan, the BJP leader said ISI chief Lt Gen Zaheer-ul-Islam, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Hizb leaders Hafiz Saeed and Saeed Salahuddin had assured that terrorism would be fuelled in 2014.
Pakistan is committed to fulfilling this promise.
The killing of soldiers along the border, suicide attacks in Samba, Hiranagar are part of this strategy.
Terming the demand to abolish the privileges of the army in the state as "dangerous", the BJP leader said it was "anti-people" to do such things till there was lasting peace in the state.
These are the anti-national elements.
He stressed that the statements of the leaders, the army and the security forces, should be stopped.
Snow Dane ready to "collaborate" with Germany on U.S. surveillance
Edward Snowden, the U.S. intelligence informant, has announced that he is ready to travel to Berlin to give evidence to the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander fail to respond to his activities.
German MP Hans Christian Straw Belle, met Mr Snow Dane on Thursday in Russia, where he has been granted asylum, to speak about testimony in Germany.
In a letter submitted by Mr Snowden to the media in Berlin on Friday, the MP said: “Although the results of my efforts are empirically positive, my government views disagreements as party-changes, and provides no defenses that are an attempt to criminalize political speech with allegations of hooliganism.”
However, speaking the truth has not been a crime.
In the letter, Mr Snowden said he believes the support of the international community could persuade the US government to abandon criminal charges against him.
The charges filed by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of government property.
Hans Peter Friedrich, German Minister of Internal Affairs, told Zeit online: “If Mr. Snowden is willing to talk to German authorities, we will have to find ways to make it possible.”
Relations between the US and Germany have come under pressure as the NSA claims to have bugged Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Operman, an MP who is the chairman of the parliamentary committee, oversees intelligence. said that if Mr Snowden had the opportunity to listen as a witness "totally ruin the relationship with the U.S. and without endangering them," then it should also be taken.
Mr. Straw Belle, a member of the Green Party of Germany, posted a photo of himself with Mr. Snowden on Twitter feed.
He was on a visit to Russia with two German journalists.
According to the former NSA contractor's lawyer, Snowden is not able to return to Russia if he leaves Russia.
If Snowden testified in Germany he would be "safe" there, which would require assurances, the MP said.
Mr. Snowden, in his letter, said he had to leave home because "he had to face a dire and sustained campaign."
He, however, said that the world is happy and overwhelmed by wider responses "to its work of political expression."
World citizens, including the United States, as well as high officials, have condemned the unveiling of an irresponsible system of comprehensive surveillance of a public service.
The letter expands a proposal to cooperate with German authorities "when the problems of the humanitarian situation have been resolved."
Frenier Airlines will charge carry-on baggage charges
Frontier Airlines plans to charge $100 to store luggage carry-on for passengers on its aircraft board.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging for $100 for a carry-on bag and it will, however, charge $2 for coffee or soda, although its announcement on Wednesday reported that passengers can keep the whole box.
The new carry-on charge is for the bag in the overhead bin, therefore, the small bag under the seat will still be free.
Frontier said that if paid in advance, $100 will have to wait if the passenger waits to make the payment until they are at the gate.
Frontier spokesman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is to be achieved to take care of the charge in advance of passengers.
"We don't want to charge it," he said.
The airline began charging for the first and second check bags in 2008.
Those who are trying to avoid passenger charges are stuffing as much as they can in carry-on baggage which is stacked in overhead compartments, which means there is often less space in this compartment.
Fees are a way to bring down for passengers on board.
O'Malley said it's not really about raising new charge money.
It has become increasingly difficult for Frontier's most loyal customers to find that overhead bin's place.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay it.
This means that the next person in the line may have to pay $100 for a similar bag, while a passenger in the line at a Frontier Gate, can get a bag free.
O'Malley said that Frontier's website and check-in procedures are being changed to ensure that passengers know about the fees before getting to the gate.
Frontier's new carry-on fee will not start until summer, although a date has not been set.
Passengers often express dissatisfaction about baggage charges and other charges, but the airline prefers them.
They argue that it costs money to handle baggage, and that passengers who want service should pay for it.
Baggage fees on Wall Street are seen as a sign that many airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, most of them do not charge on-the-go fees.
Spirit Airlines Inc. launched Carrie-On Charge three years ago for the first time, and fellow discounter Allegiant Air later.
Along with such a fee, another airline is Hungarian-based Wiz Air, which airline consultant Jay Sorensen said, and which tracks add-on fees.
He said Spirit's carry-on fee brings in $50 million a year, which was estimated in a December 2011 report.
Sorensen, a former executive of Midwest Airlines, recently flew into Spirit and wondered if passengers had to face carry-on unusual bag fees at the gate.
"The boarding process that I saw in my airline career was seamless," he said.
I was hoping to grind teeth and look out at a fight gate.
"The plane was full and he said it climbed the licensure-split."
Frontier is also following Spirit's $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier states that travelers who take soda, or juice, can keep the whole box, and will give it free coffee only for once.
It will still remove the water.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for beverages in 2008, but they retreated seven months later after passengers complained and followed no other main airline being there.
Frontier's move to charge carry-on charges if passengers do not purchase directly from the airline is its latest effort to operate customers towards its own website.
The airline pays the online travel vendor Orbitz such $10 to $25 for each sold ticket.
That's why all airlines have been given an incentive to operate passengers to buy directly from them instead of going through an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has moved forward in this area.
In September many often began giving away half of the flight miles to customers who bought from these individuals from an online travel agency
On Wednesday, it reduced the mileage award by up to 25 percent of the trip mile.
So, a 1000 mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency will earn 250 miles.
It also allows them to choose their seats in advance for sole passengers when they buy directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal base of customers in its home town in Denver, but its business is dwindling and it is losing money.
Revenues fell by 9 per cent and its flight capacity fell nearly 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by corporate parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republicans are trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of the airline's sales.
NSA accused of "internal error" instead of hackers for website crashes
The Mysterious National Security Agency said on Friday that our website was shut down for a few hours due to some technical glitches, not because of hackers as some people claimed online.
“The NSA.gov was not in access for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during the pre-determined update,” the intelligence agency said in an emailed statement.
This problem will be solved tonight.
It is not true that the claim that this obstruction, delivered denial of service [DDOS] came due to the attack.
In the evening, online server trackers found that the NSA's website was closed for at least six hours, and the site was still not accessible for some users.
A spokesperson for the NSA told ABC News that the agency's internal, sensitive network was "not at all in agreement."
No classified information is in danger, the spokesperson said.
At least one hacker group has claimed online that they are responsible for blocking the NSA's website by DDoS attack.
The DDoS attack is designed in such a way that such a large amount of traffic is sent to the target website until the site is closed due to server overload.
This cyber strategy is relatively unrefined and the aim of the attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the system.
The former highly secretive NSA, which has never been named "no such agency", has become the subject of much debate and bitter criticism among the general public over the past months, following the events of a large number of foreign and domestic spying programs - the collective alienation of the former NSA by Edward Snowden and the secret NSA files by the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
Due to such growing controversy about the agency, after the incident tonight, there was speculation that the incident was the result of targeted cyber operations.
Beautiful expression was presented in line with the story of 'Another Dronacharya', showing harmony between the Dwapar Yug and the circumstances of today.
It was shown that in today's context, a guru is bound to follow the wrong path by binding in which chains.
The programme was inaugurated by Chief Guest MLA Prabhudayal Valmiki, Cantonment Council vice-president Shipra Rastogi, Naresh Kansal and Shakti Singh.
The play depicts the similarity of the conditions of Dronacharya of the Dwapar era and present-day Aurobindo, a professor.
Directed by Anil Sharma, Bharat Bhushan Sharma, Anil Sharma, Vinod Bekain, Hemant Goel, Seema Samar, Vishnidhar Chaturvedi, Abid Sami, Shiva Gajala, Amit, Ramesh, Arjun, among others performed in full justice to the characters.
In the play, lighting was done by young artist Jitendra C. Raj and set was designed by Hemant Kumar.
Later, various awards were given to those who contributed to the literary and cultural cause of the festival.
Dr Aslam Jamshedpuri, head of Urdu department of Charan Singh Vivi, senior journalist Shambhunath Shukla and colour artiste Jitendra C. Raj were also present on the occasion.
Secretary Surinder Sharma, Rakesh Kaushik and Abid Rizvi were among those who contributed to the success of the event.
Decline in Bombardier’s profits as aircraft deliveries, decline in orders
Canada's aircraft and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday, in the third quarter in its train unit and less than as pressured by aircraft order and delivery on contract issues.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not present an update on the issues on whether its brand new CSeries aircraft will release any flight test data or complete its ambitious program of aircraft going into commercial service from next September.
Nearly another half-month after the first flight of the test plane, it has just flown three times, raising the question of whether the test phase is on track or not.
The result fell short of the forecast and the stock sent over 8 percent to the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Dorssen, an analyst stock with National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered its rating for "field performance" from "month" to "region performance" the stock is limited to the next one or two quarters when it is up.
"Weak aircraft deliveries were mostly expected, we are clearly disappointed with the margin performance in transportation," Dorsen said in a client note.
We will receive new orders for Bombardier CSeries as the flight test program progresses.
However, if any new orders are not announced in the coming months, there are doubts that the market will be skeptical of the programme.
Bombardier hopes the aircraft family can now cut it off at the low end of the Boeing and Airbus-dominated market.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after a month of delays.
Potential buyers wait for the results of the flight test to validate the company's claims about the new jetliner fuel efficiency and potential cost savings but are as moderate as the pucca order for CSeries is up to 177.
403 complete orders and commitments are available with 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Pierre Baudoin was confident that Bombardier would meet its 300 firm order target from the time it first introduced the jet into commercial use.
The officials assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the programme was going according to schedule.
"The test aircraft lived on the ground longer than expected," Boudoin said in a conference call, adding that land testing and software updates were scheduled during the aircraft's interval.
Every manufacturer makes a schedule in a different way.
We decided to make a first flight and have an updated period and said what we did.
That's all going to happen through the flight program.
The second part of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, with the following shortly afterwards, the company said.
Still, analysts are skeptical that customers can start operating a CSeries aircraft after their first flight in the first 12 months.
Bombardier has said that it evaluated the Service (EIS) schedule in admissions and will provide an update in the next few months.
"This slow pace of flight testing - although in line with Bombardier's internal schedule - reinforces our view that the service in the entry will be pushed to Q1/15," Dorsen said.
For the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million a year ago, or 8 cents per share, $172 million, or 9 cents per share.
The adjusted income per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenue dipped marginally from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
According to analysts Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, revenues of 10 per share cent and $4.56 billion were expected.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said 45 aircraft were delivered during the quarter, down from 57 a year ago
The net order fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The backlog in the aerospace division was $32.9 billion on September 30, with no change from December 31.
"Airspace, the results were in line with our guidance, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were a disappointment," Baudouin said.
Aerospace revenues fell by 13 per cent in $2 billion.
Bombardier said the world's largest train manufacturer, the division had a revenue increase of about 11 percent for $2.1 billion.
Orders in the transport unit were backlogs of about $32.6 billion as of September 30, up marginally from December 31.
Some major contracts in the margin of the transport division were also affected by execution issues.
The new guidelines will be provided in the fourth quarter, executives said.
Shares of Bombardier, which announced the inclusion of Google Inc's chief financial officer Patrick Pichett Board, were down 8.5 percent at C$4.83 in mid-afternoon trading on Thursday.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and nearest competitor to Bombardier, reported a 10 percent fall in quarterly profit on Thursday.
New research has shown that we work with utmost sincerity and dedication in the morning.
You don’t lie to anyone and you don’t feel like stealing or cheating.
But in the evening, our mind changes and we keep the ideal aside and walk against the rule.
Researchers at Harvard University and the David Eccles School of Business at Uto have given many interesting facts.
According to the researchers, while not stressing work in the morning, we prefer moral values, but due to fatigue or excessive pressure in the evening, honesty decreases.
The researchers conducted two experiments.
He asked some people to tell the number of points on the computer screen.
For example, people had to tell if the point is higher on the left or higher on the right.
The participants were told that if they give the wrong answer instead of the correct answer, they will be given the money.
In this experiment, it was observed that the people who were used between 8 am and 12 am did not make any mistake and gave the correct answer.
While experimenting with people between 12 pm and 6 pm, it was found that they deliberately gave wrong answers by keeping their principles in check.
This has enabled researchers to prove that the greed for money in the morning does not matter to our honesty, but in the evening we stop paying attention to morality.
The study was published in the latest issue of Psychological Science.
After the robbery, the miscreants fled from the spot.
The injured have been admitted to a hospital in a serious condition.
Sohanvir, a resident of Madhi village, recently retired as an under engineer from the power department.
On Wednesday, he was returning home by bicycle after withdrawing Rs 44,000 from a branch of Syndicate Bank at Bhola.
Two bike-borne miscreants looted cash worth Rs 44,000 from Sunder.
When Sundar protested, the miscreants shot him in his stomach, causing him injuries.
Upon receiving the information, the family members and villagers rushed him to a hospital in Meerut in a serious condition.
No case was registered till the filing of the report.
Three days ago, while returning home from the same bank, Jasvir, a resident of Ammanulapur, was shot dead by two bike-borne miscreants.
The police have not been able to identify any other cases in the recent past.
The SSP, Sumer Singh Yadav, claimed that the incidents would be revealed soon.
When the hotel staff protested, they started assaulting them.
The son of the drunk MP started a scuffle with RK Singh, the younger brother of the hotel owner who came to the rescue.
In the meantime, many more people came.
When he tried to catch the young man, he opened fire from the revolver.
The firing triggered panic in the area.
The hotel staff caught hold of him and informed the police.
The owner of the hotel, Munna Singh, lodged a complaint against Anand Pandey, son of Gorakhnath Pandey, MP from Berwa Paharpur of Koirana police station in Bhadohi district.
The police arrested Anand and seized the revolver.
According to Handia Inspector Ashok Saraswat, Munna Singh, a resident of Khabhor in Pratapgarh, runs a hotel called Raga Darbar on the National Highway.
Around 8 pm, Anand Pandey reached the hotel and ordered food.
When the food was delayed, he started abusing, assaulting and firing.
Anand was drunk and threatened to kill the hotel staff.
According to the inspector, the hotel is close to Bhiti village and is adjacent to Bhadohi district.
Mr. Big was jailed for giving secret information about the police investigation.
42-year-old Basharat Ditta used to inform the infamous criminal Neil Scarborough
The lawyer felt that people could find out about his secret drug addiction.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court
The defence’s top lawyer, who told Mr Big about the main police investigation, would get to know people about his secret addiction to drugs because he was afraid, has been jailed for three years.
The 42-year-old Barasat Datta, after signing an agreement over his cocaine addiction, provided the notorious criminal Neil Scarborough with sensitive confidential information about his drug trafficking activities being investigated.
The lawyer, nicknamed "Bash" and praised as "Top Brief" by criminals, was arrested from his home in 2011 after police surveillance operations in Scarborough, which he represented in the previous Narcotics Trial.
Authorities had seen Scarborough, 32, holding three bags of cocaine in the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was out for a Law Society dinner with his colleagues.
After finding cocaine particles in Dita's hair, her wallet, and her credit card, the investigation revealed that Dita was a "regular user" of Class A drugs.
During the eight-month period between January and August 2011, he attempted to illegally obtain information about the arrest of two people on behalf of Scarborough and its affiliate.
All four suspects were being monitored by the police at that time as part of the main investigation into the heroin and cocaine gangs operating in Lancashire, Cumbria, Mercside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
There were 32 others who were jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine worth 1.5 million pounds, and more than 200,000 pounds of cash during several raids.
The 42-year-old Datta used to provide information to criminals because he feared people would not know about his cocaine addiction.
Ditta, a law firm working at Forbes Solicitors in Blackbonard, was today facing a failure in the Liverpool Crown Court after being found guilty in two cases of obstructing the course of justice after a three-week trial at the Liverpool Crown Court.
She had admitted about keeping cocaine at an earlier hearing.
The lawyer's bad timing started when the police, while examining Scarborough, found that he had been in regular contact with Datta since February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and saw him coming into Dita's house and holding more than 60 percent purity drug under the lawyer's bin in the Black Golf Glow.
Scarborough was in regular contact with Ditta, who had gone out for dinner at Blackburn Rovers Football Stadium, Ewood Park, after being drugged.
On reaching home, the lawyer came to know that the drug was kept there and there were nine conversations between them.
The court heard that Dita was found to be a "regular user" of cocaine in the trial after she found traces of A category drug on her hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but refused to use cocaine and said he was talking to a suspected dealer because he was her client and said their discussion was a matter of "legal privilege."
During his arrest, Datta tried to remove many credit cards by taking out his wallet, but he was seized, and his hair sample was taken.
In a police interview, she said she used to run offices from her workplace as well as from her home, and her clients used to call her home for legal matters.
After the main persons who were arrested told what the spies knew about them, the court heard that Datta used to call the leading men of the drug supply chain, some of whom he had earlier presented the case.
Annie White, on behalf of the prosecution, said: “The criminal lawyer should be best aware of not breaking the law.”
Mr. Datta is accused of misusing his position as a criminal advocate, connecting too much with his specific client.
We are not talking about the relationship of the general drug dealer, but about the dealer who is providing the drug to his lawyer.
Some of his conversations must have been legal without a doubt, because he was a lawyer.
But he went beyond his limits of the lawyer-client relationship.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as possible so that they were able to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Datta was not respecting his profession, but was insulting.
He made a lot of closeness with certain clients, especially from Scarborough, and he allowed himself to compromise with his freedom.
Datta denied any wrongdoing and claimed: “If I were a corrupt lawyer, who I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, but I would have done it immediately.”
But after the hearing, Lancashire Police Superintendent Lee Halsted said: "At the time Mr. Datta began receiving drugs from organized criminals, he converted himself from a criminal advocate to a criminal."
Due to his cocaine addiction, he compromised and became too weak for the purposes of leading members of organized crime groups, who used it to obtain important information related to police investigations.
Advocates must maintain the highest standard of integrity, and instill confidence and confidence in the people.
Mr. Datta has cheated with this belief and tried to escape under the guise of his profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire examined Mr. Ditta, who was also found guilty of three incidents of possession of cocaine and now obstructing the course of justice, which demonstrates our commitment to bringing the perpetrators to court.
This case should serve as a warning to criminals that no one is far from the reach of the law.
We will find you and present you before the court.
Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he was found guilty of conspiring to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other members of the gang were sent to prison for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On her website, Dita gave a question and answer session about herself, in which she said her fantasy job would be to become a lawyer for a death penalty client in the U.S., to be Muhammad Ali's dinner guest and to be an inspiration for her work on inequality.
Kenyan press outraged over controversial media law
The newspaper challenged the bill as unconstitutional, saying it is "a frightening place, and it is legitimate to ask: What is there to prevent Parliament from taking away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow?"
Cyrus Kamau, managing director of the Capital Group, which is Kenya's most prestigious independent radio station and the operator of the news website CapitalFM, said, "This law is cruel and very punitive, and we reject it."
He said the new media tribunal "will always be biased, because it is part of the government" and that banning content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope that the President will listen to us, and we appeal to them to reject this bill and send the MP people back," he said.
According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will give the government "strict control over the media" while The Standard said democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya were "serious shock" and called the bill "ruling."
The bill is being passed as one of the measures to strengthen national security after an Islamic gunman attacked the Westgate shopping mall in September.
Kenyan media had aired security camera footage of the squads sent to the site of the attack, showing them looting the mall purposefully, angering the Kenyan media.
Police chief David Kimayo had summoned two journalists and mediapersons for questioning, though the summons was withdrawn after media ransacked.
Under the new bill, media companies can be fined up to 2 million Kenyan shillings and one million Kenyan shillings for journalists, and the additional risk of "removal" from the list or not being recognized by the official press will be different.
The Tribunal also has the power to forfeit the property of the violator if the penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “a single penalty is enough to shake the foundation of most FM stations.”
It also said that these measures could have devastating effects that are described as Kenya's "living blogosphere."
By shutting down the media, politicians know that they can make their own arbitrariness.
National journalist Mutuma Mathew describes Kenyan media as a major source of control and balance in public life, writing "no one will ever know."
He wrote, “If left to politicians, they will insolvent the country and bring us back to the era of hunting and hoarding.”
In the past, Kenyan lawmakers have faced the wrath of the people.
In May, he voted in favor of rejecting the deductions ordered by the National Pay Commission, and reinstated nearly 532,000 shilling monthly, tax-free body pay, which is considered one of the highest in the world.
The birthday of Mukesh Ambani's wife is on November 1, but as soon as the clocks on the night of October 30 resounded, the entire Jodhpur began to echo with Nita Ambani's birthday.
Earlier, the atmosphere of the celebration was completely made up of the performance of AR Rahman's team.
In the musical night that began at 8 pm, Rahman performed his signature songs.
Priyanka Chopra was on the stage for her dance moves.
Around 32 charters arrived in Jodhpur for guests attending Nita Ambani's birthday celebrations.
The charter was parked in Jaipur, Delhi, Udaipur and Jodhpur due to reduced parking space at the Jodhpur airport.
Similarly, 135 luxury cars including BMW and JugR were also called.
Sood said that the cleanliness system in the city and the street lights have completely failed.
No action is being taken by the Municipal Corporation and HUDA to run the city centre of Panchkula.
They have demanded that Panchkula be completely abolished.
Addressing a press conference here on Friday, VK Sood said the city has got new councillors and mayors after the municipal elections, but they do not have the power to get work done.
The city has become a dumpy city councillor and the officials are working on their own.
Sood said the municipal corporation has crores of rupees, but all the money is being deposited in banks as FDs and interest is being collected.
But no steps are being taken to put money on the development of the city.
VK Sood said the problem of dumping ground is the most serious.
Due to the construction of a dumping ground in Sector 23, people living in the Ghaggar cross-sectors have been forced to live a helluva life for the last several years.
Municipal officials have been talking about shifting the dumping ground in village Jhuriwala for the past several years, but people of Barwala area are already facing two-fourths of the serious problem of flies.
He said the health and education system in the villages had deteriorated.
Till date, no work has been started to provide facilities to the people in rural areas.
UN sets new targets to tackle poverty
The United Nations is immediately embarking on a new set of goals that will replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were launched 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
To replace the MDDs ending in 2015, the Australian diplomat played a key role in advancing the "Sustainable Development Goals" just before the Sustainable Development Summit, which began overnight in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be supported by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the night summit that it was time to "raise above national interests."
“I am very happy that the Member States have agreed to initiate and take ownership of the process to establish a universal sustainable development goal.”
These SDGs will be based on our development under the Millennium Development Goals, and will be an integral part of the development roadmap after 2015.
I will do my best to implement the mandate given to me by our member countries to meet our far-reaching objectives of Sustainable Development Goals based on the success of MDGs.
Mozambican security concerns raise as powerful figures clash
With a statue of Mozambique founder President Samora staring down at them, thousands of people gathered in central Maputo to shout peace in a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back, we want stability," said Vanessa de Susa, chief executive of an investment company.
Terrified about his country's future, he changed his corporate dress from a printed T-shirt "We Demand Security" in Portugal and joined a crowd of the capital Independence Square on Thursday.
The conflict between government forces and Ray Namo for two weeks has been reported almost daily, one more than 20 years after the peace deal.
Ray Namo was once a notorious rebel of the white-ruled Rhodesia and the apartheid movement supported by the South African government as part of efforts to destabilise the country's independent government.
After the peace agreement of 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country is unlikely to return to a full-blown conflict, but recent events have provoked foreign investors and locals.
The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy. Some of the companies including Rio Tinto, Brazil's Well, Eni could bring in investments of more than $50bn next year.
The ruling Frelimo Party, the dominant political power since 1975, and Ray Namo blame each other for the tension.
Ray Namo says the government launched the latest conflict on October 17 by launching attacks on its members in the province of Sofa La, a traditional Ray Namo stronghold.
Attacks on former rebels and then rising, government forces attacked Renmo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhaka Ma, group leader, Fernando Majhang, Ray Namo's spokesman, the Financial Times reported.
The government blames Ray Namo for triggering the confrontation, accusing the soldiers of attacking.
President Armando Zebuzhn has called for the debacle to be "unprecedented".
Mr Zibuzan told the AFP, French news agency on Wednesday that Mr. Dhaka saw himself as a "lost" "whatever it is, the forces continue to try to prove that they can enforce their own decision on the government."
Free Limo and Ray Namo both insist that they want to avoid war.
Mr. Majang was quoted as saying that Ray Namo cancelled the 1992 peace deal but later became a matter of concern.
He told FT that that agreement is not being awarded by Free Limo
Our vision is to come back for the agreement talks, but seriously," Mr Majang said.
The last talks between the two sides did nothing special to ease tensions in a series of this year's conflict.
"It's about two big men fighting together (Jibuzhan and Dhaka)," said Joseph Han, a lecturer and Mozambique expert at the London Open University.
None of them are good interlocutors and none of them are willing to make concessions.
Ray Namo, who has been pushing for electoral reforms, had already said about the boycott of the municipal elections to be held in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted their use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to win concessions and economic spoils from the government.
Ray Namo's share in the vote has been declining since 1992, while a new party, a former Ray Namo member in which the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), is expected to improve its performance in the elections.
Mr. Majhang, who is leaving office at the end of his second term next year, wants to destroy the country's democracy, says Mr. Jibuzanko.
"He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he doesn't want to give up the presidency because he doesn't want peace, he doesn't want transparent elections," Mr. Mazang said.
What kind of capability Ray Namo has has is not clear, but it is a major North South highway he has made disruptive hit-and-run attacks on police stations and vehicles.
Most of the skirmishes are in the province of Sofa La, several hundred kilometers north of Jomaputo, with host Bera Port that relies on exporting miners, coal, including Rio Tinto and the Valley.
Rio suspended its experiment for nearly a week in June after threatening to attack the Ray Namo line.
When asked whether Ray Namo would be able to repeat this threat, Mr. Mawangvinit was almost certain.
Ray Namo "things weren't going well in Mozambique who wanted to warn the international community," Mr. Majang said.
The government of instability further exacerbated the frustrations, Fernando Lima, media cop, who is the head of an independent media company, many people are also worried about corruption, slow pace of development and the recent flood of kidnappings.
"The people responsible for the country's future are the government and the president, and think he should be one to find solutions to problems," he says.
"Omar Sultanate, a demonstrator, people still need stability.
"Nobody cares about Ray Namo and Free Limo, they just want peace again, they want free access to the roads," he said.
Children should be taught "as models for a way of life author," myths and legends.
Thor's stories could show "there is no contest of subtle tricks in brute strength," while Arthurian legends show the importance of having a dream.
To teach many of the myths that it would not be appropriate to teach it in obscene and schools even far from "exceptionally far away, and in some cases even in the wild," Cross Lee Holland advocated a "cautionary selection" of appropriate actions of age.
"I find it surprising, in America, that myth and folklore are already a part of education," he said.
I have been advocating this as a plan for twenty years.
He has called writers and teachers "more enlightened" and it is "a new turn" for children, together with messages being "presented" in entertaining stories.
Cross Lee Holland, who has translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon to the Penguin book of Norwegian Myths and British folklore, wrote: “You may have a lot of intentions but it would be better to keep it out of sight.”
Perhaps the big difference between an adult writer writing for a child and an adult writer writing for an adult requires some sense of hope.
Everything has to be simplified or come to a happy end, because but it is an instinct of good and evil.
And that should be submitted, rather than said, revealed through a story.
It doesn't show the old base.
CHANDIGARH: Head constable Om Prakash retired after serving in the police department for 32 years.
On the occasion, officers and employees of the police department were present.
Om Prakash is a resident of village Bhaparal of Gram Panchayat Bani Bhapraal.
He provided better services during his tenure.
Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
People might argue that New York City is the birthplace of standup comedy in America: about a hundred years ago comedian Frank Fey, who served as the master of the ceremony at the Palace Theatre in Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to people sitting in the crowd about the way they interact.
Faye's discovery has expanded over the years, most recently, at the New York Comedy Fossil.
Created and operated by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Standup Institute, Caroline Hirsch, the festival celebrated its 10th anniversary this year, which included more than sixty shows at small clubs and large theatres.
“Most of these headliners appeared in the Carolinas, and became huge successes, to a level where they became too big to be played at the club,” says Hirsch.
We built this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes the presence of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as the annual music and comedy benefits for military retirees at Madison Square Garden, "Stand Up for Heroes" which included Bruce Springsteen, John Stowert, Roger Waters, and other artists, including Bill Cosby.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy has also expanded.
Many comedians who participated in this year's celebration have come from non-traditional mediums, such as Comedy Central, F<0x58>, and Spike's upcoming shows on smaller networks.
Nick Kroll, the Deep-Cable sitcom (F<0x58><0x58>) proudly reached the leading spot from the Ronchi Fantasy-Football theme "The League"), and now has his own comedy central sketch show.
Jenny Slate has been a cast member of "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation," though she is best known for her viral video series "Marsal the Shell with Shoes On."
Other young comedians with varying voices, including Crawl and Slate, are the products of the decentralised world of American comedy, based on the disillusioned, sarcastic, sarcastic, racially-focused Anthony Jaslinic.
One of the most prominent highlights of the celebration will be, an interview: David Steinberg’s talking to Larry David:
Steinberg began working as a standup comedian, but he has become a renowned television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, she hosted the show "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting will take place at the Town Hall in the center of Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all Larry’s works,” Steinberg said.
They were telling me that when he was here, sometimes he would go to the street between the two buildings and think to himself that if I ever lost all my money, I would be here.
Oil continues to fall to $96 a barrel
The fall in oil prices continued on Friday as a report offsets concerns over more supplies, where the power-hungry manufacturing sector in China is growing stronger.
The benchmark for December delivery was down 14 cents at $96.24 per barrel in Europe until late morning in electronic trading on the US crude New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract fell 5.8 percent for the month of October, falling 39 cents on Thursday.
Adequate supply of crude oil has weighed on price in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
For more than five weeks, supply has increased by more than 25 lakh barrels.
But a suggestion of strong demand showed an increase in activity that two reports on Chinese manufacturing came on Friday.
This suggests that growth could continue to strengthen China's economic recovery after being reduced from a two-decade to a third quarter at 7.8 percent in the previous quarter.
Brent crude also fell 26 cents from $108.58 a barrel on the ICE exchange in London, a benchmark for international crude used by U.S. refineries.
The court has blocked New York Police Department's pause and action on sports policy.
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a judge's order requiring the New York Police Department's pause and play program to block changes and remove the judge from the case.
US Circuit Court of Appeals 2 & Justice Shira Schindler said the judge's decision would be pending the outcome of an appeal by the city.
In August, the judge ruled in the city that it violated the Constitution in the way it prevented people and excluded them from its programme of questioning.
The city's police department also decided to allocate a monitoring to help change its policy and the training program associated with it, its findings and its remedial orders have appealed.
The appeals court heard arguments on the request travel on Tuesday.
The appellate court has said that because he compromised the requirement for a judge to avoid the presence of bias in part of a series of media interviews, and that he was wrongly removed by the public from the Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges, the judge's case should be publicly accountable for criticizing the court of statements.
The judge ruled that police officers wrongly violated the civil rights of thousands of people by targeting black and Hispanic men with its pause and sports program.
She has appointed an outside monitor to oversee major changes, including policies, training and economic reforms in supervision, and has ordered a pilot program to test body-worn cameras in some campuses where she is most off.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of those whose cases were dismissed after a police stop.
An oral argument on the appeal of the Nagar is scheduled for sometime after 14 March 2014.
The suspension and sports betting have been criticised along with civil rights advocates.
The pause and play policy has been around for decades in some form, but mostly from black and Hispanic men, 684330 to an all-time high in 2011 has been recorded as the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg’s administration stops the growth dramatically.
A lawsuit was filed by four men all minorities in 2004 and became a class action case.
Proponents of NYPD’s pause and change in the sports program have said that unfair treatment will end a more reliable and effective police force will be molded and other police departments can influence the use of the policy.
Opponents say the changes will undermine the morale of the police, but will resolve a broader problem of a police force under pressure after committing crimes, wasting money and not shrinking by thousands of officers during the past decade.
The judge noted that the suspension and termination for the sport had not been kept, which is constitutional, but had improved the implementation of the stop of the NYPD.
A large number of participants from Godda, Pakur, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, Hazaribagh and Chatra districts participated in the training.
During the seven-day period, all participants were informed about various disciplines, including tent pitching, flag poles.
The training is being carried out in collaboration with Dr. Ashutosh Kumar Rai and Isha Ghosh.
By joining all religions in prayer, all the participants are spreading the spirit of unity.
Camp head Vipin Kumar State Training Commissioner is giving his special support.
Colson used phone hacking to confirm secret information
Andy Colson, a former editor of News of the World, has been accused of using "phone hacking, surveillance and face-to-face" in an attempt to confirm a so-called secret information about Charles Clarke's relationship with him while he was home secretary.
Prosecutor Andrew Addis Q.C. told Old Bailey that the News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clark was meeting his "attractive special counsel" Hannah Pollby.
The court said the newspaper hired private investigator Glenn Mulker to hack Polby's voicemail and "keep an eye on" the male, but Colson also called and left her voicemail.
"The prosecution suggests that Mr. Colson, who is currently the editor of NOTW, is not known to stand outside people's houses and keep an eye on them, but rather keep articles in front of people, see how people react to it," said Mr. Addis.
He said that NOTW used three methods to investigate cases: phone hacking, surveillance and face-to-face.
The third group consisted of the editors themselves.
He knew the other way around, and he knew the other way around.
What about the first one?
Did he know about phone hacking?
He says, no, we say, "Yes, he knew exactly."
The rumor about Clark's romantic relationships was first introduced by AOTW's feature desk when a sexually inclined source in Ms. Pollby said: "Don't waste your time, he's with Charles."
From home to Mulcare in August 2006, the tape of voicemail was seized at least three times from Ms. Pollby's phone.
Investigators also found entries in the personal investigator's computer on which Ms. Pollby and her sister were named "projects."
During the period in which he was being investigated, Ms. Pollby's grandparents used to call anonymously and seek information about him.
Former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup witnessed Ms. Pollby’s visit.
On June 18, 2005, Colson told him via a voicemail: "I've got a story we're planning to run tomorrow, which I'd definitely like to talk to Charles about."
Mr. Addis said Colson's involvement in the case was in partons with other important individuals, such as former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
The bench heard on Thursday that Colson had spoken to Mr. Blanket about a consensual relationship with a married woman while he was looking into the case of co-defendant Rebecca Brooks who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks refused to have contact with other people to hack the phone between October 3, 2006, and August 9, 2006.
Mulcare, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have accepted phone hacking.
Encouraging corporate fear from the NSA's disclosure of state surveillance.
Late on a quiet day in August, a German police helicopter ransacked the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
On the directive of the Office for the Defense of the Constitution (BfV), Germany’s domestic intelligence agency, the mission was to take a picture of the rooftop of the U.S. post office, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media asked BfV to express hope to identify the presence of Lysening Antenna and indicated an exchange action between the German Foreign Ministry in the US and Berlin.
James Clapper, director of U.S. national intelligence, insisted that the U.S. should no longer use its foreign intelligence capabilities "to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies and to make U.S. companies increase their international competitiveness or extend the line below them."
But since Edward Snowden, a contractor who has built a whistleblower, began to tell American surveillance the treasure of his secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether the director will keep his word.
The US National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras, and our cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, and Yahoo, expressed fears about state surveillance.
The last thing came when it was discovered that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was bugged, possibly a decade ago.
If Europe’s most powerful individuals can be targeted, of course business leaders are also likely to be targeted.
Snowden has made in-depth cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it would be feasible to use these data for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up" says Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, who represents small and medium-sized German IT companies.
According to a survey published in July by German companies consultancy, the U.S. has almost become a big risk now, like China, when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft.
Leaked by Mr. Snowden in all documentation, there is, however, no evidence to date that the U.S. went to the business secrets of foreign companies for its companies.
Politicians have expressed concern about the EU’s lack of internet capabilities. And it should strive to reduce its dependence on the US.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
Someone in the German parliament said that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
Haso Platner, president of the German business software company SAP, said "It's no way," adding.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, then he didn’t have to let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized., from coal, to cars, to farmers.
But the IT industry is everything.
Snowden's disclosures about U.S. technological sophistication and spying access have proven to be a blow to some companies that previously believed the biggest surveillance threat was China.
A major shift is taking place in the cloud computing sector where European authorities are more aware that data stored in the US is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore potentially sensitive.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade body, some 10 percent of non-US members canceled plans to use a US-based cloud provider after disclosures about the data prism mining program.
Jim Snabe, SAP’s co-CEO says: “We saw a new question that customers didn’t come up with a year ago – is my data stored? And can you guarantee that it will physically remain in that jurisdiction?”
Many German officials argue that the latest reports are simply confirming what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most prized secrets and data and therefore must be guarded at all costs.
It is not surprising that economic espionage takes place.
This has always happened.
“This has been a topic for many years, and through fundamental current discussion, nothing has changed,” says Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemical manufacturer BASF.
We spy on the American commercial and industrial level, and we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our business.
Corporate leaders are generally not interested in the defense system and this is an advantage for the attacker.
For large companies, it’s been a long time since a message has been recorded whether it’s unwise to leave a business from home by taking usb stick, or leaving a laptop unattended in a hotel room is unwise to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of the carmaker Audi, says it's an age-old system of collecting mobile phones before board meetings because they can't be used as remote listening devices.
Germany’s BfV executive advises to consider using simple prepaid mobile when smart phones are compromised due to risk on foreign tours.
Prepaid mobile phones were later thrown away.
However, small and medium companies are at risk of hacking and monitoring it is a matter of concern.
In Germany, this company is at the top of the global market in a special place.
"Small and medium-sized companies often lack experience, personnel and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets against unauthorized access," BfV warns in a report.
The United States has warned of economic espionage by other countries of their own companies.
In February, the U.S. National Intelligence named Russia and Israel in a second Tier of criminals involved in hacking for economic intelligence, which is behind China, according to France's The Washington Post.
According to a board member of a German blue chip company, when it comes to economic espionage, "French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, the former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, said in an interview: “Services know well that all countries, even if they join non-terrorist combat, spy on their allies.”
We spy on the American commercial and industrial level, and we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our business.
No one is stupid.
The parents of a Georgia teenager who was killed in an "unprecedented accident" believe his son was killed
A Georgian teenager whose body was found wrapped in a restling mat at her high school gym believes her son was murdered, the family lawyer said on Thursday.
Valdosta, GA's Kendrick Johnson, was found trapped in a mat standing directly behind the bleachers inside his high school gym on January 11.
Investigators at the Londes County Sheriff's Office concluded that Johnson had died in an "unprecedented accident", but the 17-year-old boy's family denied it.
Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told Fox News.com that he "completely believes his son has been murdered."
They do not believe in the death of the sheriff in the way he was told.
"They believe this is beyond the logic of physical laws and common sense," Crump said.
They feel that this conclusion, is an excuse for the safety of the person or people responsible for the death of their son.
"He sent his son to school with a book-back, and he returned to a body bag," he said.
U.S. Attorney General Michael Mulare said Thursday he was conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, noting that many important questions remain unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was he murdered because of a crime?
Murray said this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will comply with the facts, wherever they take us.
My aim is to bring out the truth.
"I am of the view that environmental causes exist for a formal investigation," he said.
Moore told the reporter that preliminary autopsy indicated Johnson's death was as a result of "state-of-the-art respiratory arrest."
According to Murray, a second autopsy revealed a different cause of death.”
"There are a lot of questions that must be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore also said that if he found enough evidence to summon a criminal in the case of Johnson's death or to investigate civil rights, he would ask the FBI to do so.
The representative was not immediately available for comment from the Londage County Sheriff's Office when contacted on Thursday.
On Wednesday, a Southern Georgia judge ordered authorities to release all surveillance videos reviewed by investigators.
The boy's parents say they hope the video footage will give some clues as to how he died.
CDC issues guidelines for allergies of children for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines to control food allergies of children in the school.
Such guidelines have been issued for the first time by the U.S. government, as the number of school-going children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
One in every 20 children in the U.S. now has food allergies.
The CDC found that there was an 18% increase in food allergies in children between 1997 and 2007.
This guideline provides information to schools on how to inform teachers and staff about food allergies of children, and how to handle them in the event of an allergic reaction.
Schools have also been suggested to stock up on epinephrine to combat potentially life-threatening acute anaphylactics - which is the auto-injector of the epinephrine brand that is most commonly used.
The state assembly has recently updated the rules, allowing schools to keep stock of a higher amount of epinephrine easily.
This report also includes a list of common symptoms to be transmitted by children suffering from an allergic reaction.
Children may say “it looks like something is ringing in my tongue,” “it looks like there’s hair on my tongue”, or “My tongue is tingling.”
Parents of Intersex Kids Can Choose Their Children’s ‘Sex Unspecified’
Germany has become the first country in the European Union to recognize a third gender for children born with unexplained genitalia.
Newborn children will no longer be designated male or female in a conservative manner.
The new law does not require parents to declare gender for such children, which allows them to declare gender “unspecified” or “unspecified” on a child’s birth certificate.
The new law aims to reduce pressure on parents who can make decisions on gender-specific surgery for newborns in haste, and fight discrimination against intersex children.
According to the BBC, an intersex man said years later, “I am neither male nor female.”
I will continue to be a victim of injuries and stains made by doctors.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children each year is a child who is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, a part of a group of about 60 conditions that come under the scrutiny of sexual development disorders, a collective term used for the abnormal chromosome, the ovary or testicle, or an abnormally developed penis.
It may be that Wallis Simpson has been having intersex.
Gender identity is still not properly understood, but most experts in the United States believe it is better to use the best information available to specify gender when gender-determination cannot occur and to observe the psychological and physical development of the child before surgery, if such a phenomenon occurs.
New York City psychologist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender-identity matters, said Germany's new law "seems to be a good thing."
Intersex children create moral dilemmas.
“Some people are in a life-threatening situation that requires surgery, but that’s not the case with most children.”
You can specify gender without surgery, and then see how the identity develops.
The science of knowing how a sex will develop in a child is not very accurate.
No one can give a proper answer as to why this happens.
It's kind of a puzzle as to why people are gay.
In a report filed before the European Commission in 2011, intersex people are described as different from transsexual or transgender people because their status is not related to gender, but rather to its biological composition, which is neither clearly male nor female, but is either of the two or neither is clearly defined.
These characteristics may manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle weight, hair distribution, breast and length; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals; or chromosomal structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of discrimination faced by intersex and transgender persons in the field of jobs, as well as harassment, violence and biased crimes.
There are now special camps for boys with non-conforming genders.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adults to mark male, female or "third gender" on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norie May-Welby became the world's first recognized "sexless" person after winning a legal appeal to hold a "unspecified" gender status for life.
According to the interior ministry, the German passport will also have the third specification as an <0x58> for intersex persons in addition to M or F.
According to the news report on France 24, gender-related issues in neighboring France are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this strictly Catholic country signed a petition to withdraw the "gender theory" from school books.
The U.S. website Catholic Online has also opposed the German law, saying, “While the world is moving to a stage where gender is a self-selecting option, but not sexual activity, we are moving two more pillars of civilization in the opposite direction.”
The mother of the newborn in Maryland also told the baby zone that she would love to see children be assigned gender at birth.
He said on the website about the upbringing, “The upbringing without additional limitations is very stressful, especially if you don’t even know what your child’s penis is.”
Children need stability and stability.
Historically, babies born with both male and female genitals were called hermaphrodites (bisexuals), named after the handsome Greek god who was bisexual.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world considered gender as a slate that could be erased and then written.
But now a lot of people are challenging the ethics of surgery, they are realizing that gender-identification is a complex task, and sometimes even a mistake from physicians who don’t know what children will feel about their gender specifications when they grow up.
Drescher says "in the middle of the twentieth century, it was called a "psychiatry emergency."
When these children were born, you did not call the psychiatrist, you called the surgeon.
The current theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitals was presented by Dr. John Money of John Hopkins University, who considered the penis to be congenital.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental cues - how parents raise a child - determine by interacting with the child's genes and hormones to identify him as male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as "John/Joan," his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a child, whose sex was accidentally sedated during a circumcision, to give the child a full binding and release her testicle and rear it as a girl child.
“Money presented that case as a successful case of transition, but that didn’t happen,” Drescher said.
At the age of 15, the child transformed himself back into a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, she committed suicide.
Drescher said some doctors are still "following the same pattern."
But with the advent of the Internet in the years after the year 1990, individuals undergoing these gender surgeries began to appear "not happy with the result".
Similar was the case with 36-year-old Montana writer Jim Bruce, who was born with an <0x58>Y male chromosome, but his genitals were unclear.
Doctors didn’t clearly understand that his penis was small, or that his clitoris was large, but they were certain he could never live a “satisfying life” as a man.
Therefore, shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce 's external organs and testicles were surgically removed and raised as a girl.
She was given a female hormone at the age of 12.
She told ABCNews.com, “I knew I wasn’t a girl.”
I was not happy, but it was very difficult to ask.
At the age of 18, he was going to have vajinoplasty with him.
But feeling depressed and somewhat confused, she demanded medical records.
This led him to discover the terrible truth.
I was enlisted at birth - and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with DSD, which prevented his body from producing enough testosterone, causing his genitals to not develop properly.
After knowing the truth, he became a man again, taking testosterone supplements and removing his breasts.
He was discharged due to surgery.
Today, he explains his perception of intersex individuals in an organization called the Interface Project to normalize people.
But, Annie Tamer-Mattis, executive director of California-based legal group Advocates for Informationd Choice, expresses concern that Germany’s law “invites silence and stigma.”
“A lot of activists feel that German law will prompt parents to make quick decisions and prompt the child to specify “unscheduled.”
We are afraid that this will encourage interference.
We think that rather than waiting, it is better to specify the male or female gender.
But we don't know how the law will play its role, so we can only guess.
Tamer-Mattis said his organization supports Australian law because "it allows adults to be identified in a third gender."
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal sex,” he said.
The law of Germany relates to specifying it at the time of birth.
This is not a war fought by newborns at this time.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their body.
But Dr. Erlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh breast radiologist whose daughter has a sexual development disorder, and who assists hundreds of others in the support group, said Germany’s law would “encourage both parents and children.”
Baratji's daughter Katy was born with male chromosomes, but she had a DSD called full androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Since her androgen receptor had defects, female characteristics developed in Katy.
There is vagina in her body but there is no uterus or ovaries.
Now 29-year-old Katy is married and is a resident of the Department of Child Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to become a mother through adoption or a hostessal surrogacy.
“This law allows parents to ensure that they don’t take decisions on their own in haste,” Bartz said.
It provides them with proper understanding and time by some testing before writing, ‘male’ or ‘female’.
In this way, you stay well - raise the child, love the child.
You have a beautiful baby and have fun with it.
We do not need to have a surgery in a hurry which cannot be returned.
"It brings children into the decision-making process and frees parents from the anxiety that motivates them because they don't believe they are doing well," he said.
Ultimately, the child will determine which gender he is more comfortable with—and that would be a great thing.
It enables children to make decisions for themselves.
A legal awareness camp was organised by Tehsil Legal Services Committee Ramnagar under the chairmanship of the committee and sub-judge Sandeep Kaur of Ramnagar.
Students and others were given the right to education and the law for economically backward people.
During the camp, advocates M L Gupta, Rohin Bhardwaj and Sarpanch raised awareness on the subject.
A large number of villagers were present on the occasion.
Report: Considering the Biden Dumping Obama campaign for Hillary Clinton.
According to the New York Times, close advisers to President Barack Obama secretly considered Hillary Clinton as Biden's replacement for the vice president ticket for 2012.
The most notable explosion in the revelation is the massively anticipated 2012 campaign Tom by Mark Halperin and John Halemann, "Double Down: Change the Game 2012."
The Times received a copy of the upcoming book and reported Thursday evening that the president's top advisers held "widespread group meetings and polling in late 2011" to learn what dumping Biden could help in Obama's re-election fall hopes.
According to the Times national political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book gives full details of the campaign of the main executives and the White House, the head of the former White House staff, put the bill for the name, to find out what effect former state secretary Clinton's change from vice president to vice president influences on the poll.
The potential switch was a very safe secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen presidential advisers – including former Obama campaign chief Jim Massina, and former White House senior advisers David Oxlord and David Palouffe – knew the changes were under consideration.
"Double Down" claims that Dilla tried to replace Biden despite his personal amalgamation, even before finally deciding when he was telling his information that Clinton's ticket would not improve Obama's situation.
In an interview with Martin, Cunningham confirmed that the administration had actually considered Clinton’s place with Biden.
"I said looking at the whole scene, and one of them, it was," he told the newspaper.
You remember, when the presidency was in danger at that time, we were in such a situation as, "Holy Christ, what else shall we do?"
While Dell described the research as "precaution," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign made significant investments to find out how much the claim would yield if the poll was conducted.
"The campaign doesn't spend on voting and focused groups like money unless they're seriously considering something," Martin said on AC360.
It's unclear, halachic, whether Obama knew his team was looking for change.
Martin told CNN that he asked if his boss knew of a possible reshuffle.
While Dell said he "didn't think the president was aware of the possible change", the former chief of staff believed it was "possible" that Obama knew.
"Double down" sure: will not answer whether the political investigation reached Obama's desk. Martin further explained.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama was not aware of Biden dumping ticket research.
"Possibly," Martin said.
Glow-in-the-dark ice cream do you like?
A British entrepreneur has created the world's first glow-in-the-dark ice cream using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis has taken great advantage of the sea animal to develop the best breakfast.
He came up with the idea after reading a research paper on jellyfish and convinced scientists in China used chemical glare to re-slice proteins.
Ice cream will increase the pH level of protein by reacting with the tongue that eats it and the ice cream will shine.
Chris says that ice cream is brightened by reacting to the heat of the mouth, that is, the more licking you win, the more it will be brighter.
Charlie, founder of Lick Me I Am Delicious Ice Cream Company, said: “It’s an incredible thing, but the early days produce me <0xC2><0xA3>200 to about 2 grams of stuff.”
The protein we are using in ice cream will react with the neutral pH in the tongue.
As the mouth warms, the protein will increase the pH level and the ice cream will shine.
We've been experimenting for the past few months and it looks perfect to share on Halloween as it gives amazing shine effects.
This will probably be the most expensive ice cream I've made because the glitter of jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So the cost of each scoop comes to me around 140 pounds.
Isak, however, is very good.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol, is famous for its unusual flavors including beer, cheese, meat and gold leaf.
But his next project is going to be even more ambitious.
He said: "I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream."
It’s natural impossible because of the ice crystals that make up the refraction over ice cream, but I think we’ll find a way to do it.
Ice cream is the usefulness of a jellyfish, synthesized by Chinese scientists.
The entire market in Rani Bagh market was at a standstill from the customers.
It was recently that people had to wait 15 to 20 minutes to buy the utensils.
The same was the case in Wazirpur, Avantika Rohini, Naharpur, Ashok Vihar Central Market and Prashant Vihar Central Market.
Similar sights were seen at the bullion shops in Pitampura, Ashok Vihar and Model Town.
People also bought gold and silver ornaments and coins.
Due to this, traffic was disrupted in other markets, including the outer ring road.
However, people who left the office for home had to spend hours in the jam to reach home.
Halloween 2013: By the Numbers
When I was young, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, be quiet late and play for the dress-up neighborhood.
Today, I've become more than a greedy one.
I didn't even sign in to give candy out of my apartment for the last two years and probably won't this year.
But the statistics show that I have a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans are actually celebrating Halloween this time around $158 million., $6.9 billion will be spent on candy and costumes and decorations.
One of the things I've always wanted to do is to look at all the things that have happened in the past.
According to the NRF, the total cost of the costume is estimated to be $1.2 billion out of $6.9 billion.
This year, everyone is angry with sexist inanimate objects.
Women do not have to have vulgarity, because it is also a sexy food like pizza, hamburgers and carrots.
I hope for men a lot of zombies, and thanks to the dead space, our Instagram feeds will be created for men this year.
According to Google, the most searched costumes will be Zombies, Batman, Robbery and Chunky.
I don't think there's anything wrong with being traditional.
Last year we dressed the dog and surprised we weren’t alone.
According to the NRF, the American people will literally spend $330 million for pet costumes.
It's amazing that there are a lot of dog breeds.
When it comes to candy, we don't look around.
According to the Nielsen company, Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year.
Hairy Bars, Lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizards and Clark Bars are around 600 million pounds.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, it's good news that 41 million trucks and trucks are going to take part in our neighborhood.
But in reality, we're going to buy what we're joking about during a 90 million pound chocolate Halloween.
According to the Confectioners Association, one thing we will not use during Halloween is candycorn, but it will also sell around 35 million pounds.
That's about 9 billion people in Mecca.
It's a mystery. So far to be resolved
There's nothing more magical than the holocaust.
They have the best names, "the terror behind the wall (which, in fact, is a prison), "the cheetah-o-chik" and were like "House of Shock."
In fact, according to American power, there are 1200 officially sanctioned ghost houses in the United States that generate 500 million revenues. And those awesome good photos that your friend puts on Facebook and the man who likes and comments on you Nice Face.
Finally, let's talk about the pumpkin.
Charlie Brown introduced the great pumpkin when we were kids, and a jack-o-lantern carving is like decorating a Christmas tree - it's something we've done since we were little.
Luckily for us, the "Baby in a Pumpkin Trend" started last year thanks to the pintest, so most of us grew up carving these guards and not having sex with them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, this year, Americans will spend around $106 million on pumpkins.
The jack-o-slowly peppery lantern on its front porch probably from Illinois, which grew by 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you’re looking for additional debt, try to engrave their 2,032 pounds of pumpkin on the phone Tim and Susan Matisses in Napa, Calif., and above.

The dream of the firecracker traders to do business in the firecracker market located in the transport area has not been realised.
The firecracker traders have been trapped in the majdar following the high court order.
Neither can they now trade in the temporary firecracker market created at Ranjit Avenue, nor have they been issued licences to do business in the transport area.
The commission, constituted by the Punjab and Haryana High Court, declared the temporary firecracker market at Ranjit Avenue unsafe during its visit.
A fine of Rs 10 lakh was also imposed on the Deputy Commissioner of Amritsar for lack of proper arrangements there.
The High Court, in its order, has strongly reprimanded the administrative authorities of Amritsar, saying that what kind of administration could not solve even a problem of firecrackers for nine years.
They could not find a suitable place in the city.
After this, proper security arrangements were made and firecrackers were asked to issue licences for business in the market located at Shipgarh itself.
Though the firecrackers were happy after the order, the police on Friday watered down their happiness.
A team of the police licence branch reached the firecracker market and put counters there and sold the farm.
After that, the conditions they were told were impossible to fulfill in a day.
ACP East Gaurav Garg, Asalha licence branch in-charge Anup Kumar, SHO Sultanwind Arun Sharma and others reached the firecracker market.
He expressed dissatisfaction with the arrangements made by firecrackers.
Therefore, no licences were issued to firecrackers.
Diwali is a day away.
Due to this, traders are worried.
They are facing a loss of crores of rupees.
Firecrackers Avinash Singh, Rakesh Seth, Harish Dhawan, Harish Dua, Desraj, Satnam Singh, Manjinder Singh and Ginni say they will stake a claim on the district administration if they lose crores of rupees.
Angry firecrackers took out a protest march from Shipgarh to Ranjit Avenue on Friday night.
They raised slogans against the district administration and the police.
After this, he also stopped trading in the temporary firecracker market in Ranjit Avenue.
A fire brigade was called to rescue a lost pope at the mouth of a distressing mountain 50 feet above the ground in a mine
Cocker Spaniel Ruby ran away after a short road collision
He was spotted three days later by a dog walker trapped in the mine
Firefighters unloaded the front part of the rock from the rope to save the dog from the mouth of death
After the pope somehow got stuck at the mouth of the distressing mountain 50 feet above the ground, calling firefighting personnel gave him a lucky life.
The nine-month-old Cocker Spaniel Ruby had fled after a road collision on Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before being rescued from the mine on Wednesday.
His owner, Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, were in the Flappit mine in West Yorkshire to meet Ruby again, and he has blessed the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After his escape after a small accident, he searched for his lost dog like a madman, and an appeal was posted on social networking sites.
At 2.15 p.m. on Wednesday, a sharp-eyed dock walker spotted Ruby, 50 feet above the ground, on the mountain in a quarry.
A technical rescue team from the Clayhyton fire station rushed to the scene and took Ruby down by a rope and used a stomach tube to bring her down from the rock.
Specialist technical rescue officer Andy Clayton said: "She was in a critical situation.
She was in the middle of the front part of the rock, 50 feet from the top and bottom.
She did not do a single act during the rescue, she remained a stone.
But now he is good.
After that, she was eating biscuits.
It was a very unusual call for help.
It's incredible to see a dog.
Special Technical Rescue Officer Peter Law said: "Ruby survived fortunately."
He was likely to be seriously injured or in a worse condition.
Ruby was taken to a veterinarian for examination, where she was found to be good in addition to exhaustion and dehydration.
Miss Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire said: "It was terrible to see the rescue work."
At first I couldn’t believe how he got there.
It's amazing to get him back in his hands.
The veterinarian said that if she got too tired and fell, she would definitely fall down.
The fire brigade did a very good job.
What they have done is truly remarkable.
We were very proud of them, and they were all great.
Mr. Alderson from Keegli also said: "We were afraid she might fall, but she stayed there."
The fire brigade did an excellent job.
I can't believe how he got there.
Mick Jagger says Katy Perry didn't hit him when he was 18
During an interview with the Australian radio show this week, the Pon Star said he sang backing vocals for Zager's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard."
Perry said he had dinner with senior rocker, and “When I was 18, he hit me.”
"This thing got old, and he treats me well," he said.
The 70-year-old Zager's representative said in a statement on Thursday that he "clearly denies ever hitting Katy Perry."
The representative also said: "Possibly Perry is saying about them in another person's misunderstanding."
Perry was one of the singers to come as a guest on Rolling Stone's Tour this year.
His new album "Prism" reached the top spot this week.
George Kerevan: Europe's disintegration gave the Scots an option
Another day, another story of fear of freedom
This time we have been warned that independent Scotland will be required to join as an independent travel zone throughout Europe as a condition of EU membership.
Passport control over Barwick and barbed wire on Hadrian's walls indicate stories about the border.
The truth is that the Strathclyde paper described the potential economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, though - presumably - did not describe it in the headlines.
Nor did anyone describe that EU members spend most of their time changing their formal rules to suit their needs.
Since Scotland is no longer the Schengen area, it will be an affordable discount for the sustained non-compliance Brussels in exchange for getting what Brussels really wants from Scotland.
So, then, non-story.
And the thing that has been stuck for so long, has accumulated. First of all I heard the unsubstantiated news “Freedom means passport control” about 40 years ago.
Yet the interesting point in retelling this interesting old story was lost.
Why should independent Scotland be expected to bid for Europe anyway?
Why should London's Yoke be bought and sold to Brussels, especially now?
Here's the real European news: The great, post-war plan to organize Europe has finally come to a halt.
With the Euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.
Dedicated parties throughout the EU are gaining strength to oppose the EU or to close the euro as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Euroscaptile Alternative for Germany party - which has been founded this year itself - suddenly gained nearly five million votes in the September federal election, and thus effectively ousted the Free Democrats (equivalent to our own Lib Dems) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to build federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis proved to be radically transformative.
Along with the stringent regulations imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, the constraints imposed on national economies through compliance with the same currency are causing many people to think that Project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis did not have much role to play in the excessive budget deficit of national governments - this was only true in the case of Greece.
Rather, the euro system stabilized the currency exchange rate in favour of German exporters to its members - something that German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation, southern Europe finds itself in a situation with inherent loss of productivity compared to Germany.
The only solution is to reduce salaries and public spending - which has been encouraged by Berlin.
European productivity sickness is deeper than the current budget and currency problems.
To provide discounts to French and German energy firms on consumer spending - as a result of "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels, European industries pay twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the United Nations.
This is a paradoxical cost loss, which we have already seen in Grangemouth.
Even freeing all wages in the world cannot save the European petrochemicals industry from being affected by cheap U.S. shale gas.
As a result, a sense of rebellion has flared up among the people, especially in France, which was once a major fan of the EU.
After the war, France's top politicians saw the EU as a means to keep Germany in control, and Paris as a means to provide the world with a bill equal to Vanshington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport to political legitimacy, and it has imposed its own economic policies on Europe, causing the French economy to collapse.
Results: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-EU National Front has won by pushing the ruling Socialist to third place in the recent by-elections.
The front is the most popular party in France at the moment with 24 percent of the vote - it's a timely warning for British Labour that they can't walk by assuming that disintegration for the left, will automatically benefit for the right.
What is Le Pen doing with his new found fame in the middle of French whites, the working class?
The party wants to use next year's EU elections to create an anti-EU, anti-money laundering bloc in the European Parliament.
If, as much as possible, the anti-EU parties perform well in these elections, then this type of faction could affect the European Parliament for the first time.
My point of view is this: Soon the confluence of anti-EU and universal anti-money sentiment in Europe will put an end to the euro.
The euro will not end completely, but it will bounce back in some form, such as “Europe of the (Soviet) Nations” which will be supported by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its neighbouring economies may maintain the euro, but France and southern Europe will resume their currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project in the hope of increasing its closeness with the US.
However, Vanshington's growing interest in the Pacific indicates that Britain will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland after all?
We can choose to remain (necessarily) the territory of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests - including telling Berlin and Brussels to separate at the right time.
I think Scotland can perform better in a loose European system, provided we keep our own currency.
It will be easier for non-federal nations to work together with other like-minded countries in Europe.
Otherwise, we should think of maintaining our economic independence while following the path of Norway.
The SNP government in Scotland - notably - has been the most successful anti-money laundering political campaign in Europe, winning an astonishing majority in 2011 based on the Tori-Libe Dam Coalition, which was proposed (and implemented) by Labour's chancellor Alistair Darling.
It would be absurd for Scotland to vote for independence at this time, because in that case it would have to accept the rules of monetization imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Youth Before Time: Growing Up Early
Research shows that African-American and Hispanic girls are more likely to attain puberty at a younger age than white girls of their own age.
Physical change does not mean that youth is near.
There is no evidence that hormone or any other chemical can be blamed
Experts believe that obesity outbreaks can be a cause of puberty at a young age.
The case of premature puberty is not as effective in boys.
Pat Etheridge, a former CNN correspondent, is an expert journalist on children's health and family issues.
Should the mother be worried if her daughter starts developing breasts at the age of 7 or 8 and the hair of the genitals begins to grow?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando, Florida this week, pediatric endocrinologist Dr Paul Caplowitz made it clear that these early physiological changes are common among American girls, reflecting these new trends.
“I spend a lot of time convincing parents – that generally it doesn’t reflect rapid progress toward full puberty,” says Caplowitz.
Direct signs of development such as germination of breasts, hair and body odor of the genitals and eyes are seen in girls prematurely.
But over the last four decades, there has been a very slight change in the age of Rajaodarshan (first menstrual-religion).
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, up from 12.75 in 1970.
“When the breasts begin to develop, it takes at least two to three years in first menopause,” explains Caplowitz, who is also the author of “Time-Pre-Juvenile in Girls: The Essential Guide to Dealing with This Common Problem.”
The most accurate test of the development of youth is time.
There is debate about what the onset of puberty is, but when growth occurs with breast growth before the age of 8, the two call it "child-old".
In most cases, the procedure will slow down or stop – which can be closely monitored by the pediatrician.
In the event of more rapid progress, an endocrinologist may need to investigate to eliminate the possibility of serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
Treatments for delaying premenstrual periods and other consequences are: premature ageing of the bone, which can lead to undeveloped growth and nut length as an adult.
The recommendations for drug or hormone treatment depend on the age of the child, growth rate, growth rate, and emotional adulthood.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Caplowitz is aware of the drugs but admits, “Pressing youth can exacerbate behavioral issues, and girls may begin to feel isolated from their peers.”
The second big problem can be understood: parents simply do not want their younger daughter to have a monthly religion.
“They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or about how they will maintain hygiene,” said Caplowitz.
A woman, whose daughter had started menstruating at the age of 10, recalls, “It was a shock.”
Although there were signs of this and we also talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready.
She was afraid of her school and returned upset that she was the first to start menstruating in her classmates.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
Yet, there is no consistent evidence that milk or other foods contain hormones, chemicals in the environment, or sexually oriented messages in the media.
Boys are also - like girls - getting premature puberty.
Caplowitz lays down the rule that the main reason for this is an outbreak of obesity.
She had helped conduct the study on girls aged 6 to 9 years in 2001, which combines body fat with the time of puberty.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are also many other factors contributing to it.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to have a tendency to have puberty before white girls of their age.
There are many explanations for this.
Globally, the pattern of premature puberty appears to be influenced by everything, from economic conditions to weather and genes.
Other puzzles: Although boys are getting facial and genital hair at an early age, the practice of puberty is not as clear as girls in them.
Other physicians attending the AAP Conference supported the complexity of the subject.
Even in infants and children, it has become common to see acne and genital hair.
“We need to be careful about how we identify the real beginnings of puberty,” says Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Garrett Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek guidance from their pediatrician to seek opinions about how to talk to their children.
Caplowitz advised, “This may mean negotiating ahead of the expected time.”
If you stay calm, your child will usually respond properly.
Girls who develop prematurely need to be assured that even if it is happening prematurely, it is part of normal life.
On Thursday, the minimum temperature was recorded at 3.1 degrees Celsius.
The rain and cold wind on Wednesday night made people feel very cold.
On Sunday, people wore sweaters and headed towards markets and their destination.
After the first rain of the winter, people have also taken out the quilts.
In the morning, people were also seen enjoying the sun.
With the change of weather, cold, etc., will also be a great relief from the disease, but after that, the sunshine continued due to cloud cover throughout the day.
The children also went to school wearing sweaters.
The maximum temperature was recorded at 25.1 degrees Celsius while the minimum was recorded at 13.7 degrees Celsius, according to the Air Force Meteorological Department.
The rainfall was recorded at 7.8 mm.
According to the Meteorological Department, the sky will remain cloudy.
Large orders of jet manufacturers bet from the dispute for seat width.
This month's Dubai Arsho has sparked a fight between the leading aircraft manufacturers for the width of tourist-class seats for long-haul flights.
The dispute focuses on the width of the seat of the economy class in long-haul flights, not always as provided by airlines but whose allotted space efficiency is claimed to be the key by the latest Jet Airbus SAS and Boeing Company.
Airbus expects an industry standard of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in the economy cabin this week, but it should be decided by the airline's main rival Boeing says.
The dispute between the aircraft manufacturers comes after a possible sale of the twin-engined version of the long-range aircraft from the order entered after the 17-21 incident.
How is the previous section of the aircraft built - especially whether the seating is equal to 9 or 10, the designs of mini jumbo jets are being designed keeping in mind the Davos of greater capacity?
Boeing says it has built a "777 <0x58>" that will keep 406 people 17 inches wide and 10 people in a row in the economic department.
Airbus said that in a collision with the A350, it will take 350 people to an 18-inch, 9-equivalent seat.
Aircraft giants often strike business on technical matters through advertising in the business press.
Now, with the Airbus 777 <0x58> expected to dominate more than 100 orders in Dubai AirSho May, further appealing to the public.
Recently, it is being seen that anything is going to happen at the beginning of the Vigilante War, showing the Finnsero all three together in a restaurant, will you accept this?
Airbus sales chief John Lehi said "the Boeing regional turbo is also offering long-haul flights in close proximity."
In the form of change, people are getting big, but the way the aircraft sits has not changed.
According to data from the U.S. Department of Health, between the 1970s when the Boeing 747 Jumbo defined the modern long-haul journey, and the average 40-49-year-old U.S. male ke weight increased by 10 percent at the end of the century.
According to U.S. health statistics, the average American male's waistline in the 21st century is 39.7 inches.
Airbus says its rivals cling to the concept of a seat in the 1950s when the average circumference of the new name "jet set" was narrow.
Airbus says it has set up a research commission that suggests an additional 53 per cent improvement in sleep quality in the width of the seat.
Boeing has disputed Airbus' seat measurement data, saying it is not up to the manufacturers' decision on how airlines balance between fares and facilities.
It also says, research shows that more than the width of a seat depends on the cabin experience.
Boeing cabin expert Kent Crawver said: "It really shows the flexibility of airlines and the things they believe they need to do to be successful."
"They don't want to tell us what they're worth."
They know their business better than anyone else.
For flyers it's about the elbow room, but for suppliers it's increasingly an issue that it can affect income.
The dispute is estimated to be worth at least $700 billion in trade, with aircraft orders competing to tip the scales of U.S. and European exports in the coming decades.
For the first time in July, whether the seat layout is actually a fight between the new jets, Reuters reported.
Airbus and Boeing claimed to have 20 per cent performance per seat compared to the segment's leader in their new twin engine design, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300 aircraft.
Boeing's claim of performance depends on the 10 with the 777 <0x58> One with the original 9 with the 777 design.
10 par with profit in unit cost has now been used.
Kevin Kenston, head of Europe’s Airbus Passenger Facility, says “It’s Boeing’s aircraft to occupy more seats with our products, to make them more competitive.”
On the other hand, analysts say the entire 10-seat-per-line cabin for the current 777 S suggests that many passengers are in favor of the denser layout, which can go with cheap fares as well.
"The eighteen-inch seat width will be great for passengers, but the reality is that this business point of Airbus is driven by the threat of the Proposition 777," said Mary Curby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but are providing a list for airlines to choose from suppliers.
Jet sellers from all over the world should also take careful measures to check on this layouts competition.
Resting more, all builders are also offering high-density layouts for low-cost aircraft services and regional travel.
Airbus is giving an A350 equal to 10 but says it hasn't sold out yet.
But until recently, Airbus insisted on extensive cabin seats on some of its jet planes for the need for more cabin facility.
Modern jet aircraft are unlikely to fly on a new industry standard, without the support of another manufacturer, but it could distract from a wave of 777 <0x58> sales.
New Anti-Nicotine Vaccine May End the Joy of Smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that can eliminate the fun that comes from smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to keep mice safe from nicotine addiction for the rest of their lives.
Further testing is needed before trials on humans can begin, which can take many years, but Ronald Crystal, a professor at the Weal Cornell Medical College in New York, said initial indications are positive.
“We very much hope that this type of vaccine strategy can ultimately help millions of smokers who have tried to quit using all the methods available in the market today, but they found that their addiction to nicotine is far more powerful than these existing methods,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine has a harmless virus, which is designed to transmit genetic information with the aim of making anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cell, which then begins to form a permanent stream of antibodies.
Antibodies detect any nicotine molecule in the blood, and prevent nicotine from rising inside the smokers by neutralizing them before they reach the brain.
In the trial, the vaccinated rats, who were later given nicotine, continued their normal activities.
The researchers say that but the rat who was not vaccinated "feeled good" was a sign that nicotine had reached his brain.
This experiment was described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The earlier tobacco vaccines had failed because they had antibodies.
It had to be administered at regular intervals to maintain the level of antibodies, but proved expensive and impractical.
But the price of the new vaccine is expected to be high, as the liver will make the cell a factory of antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if the human vaccine of the future is completely safe, it can be given to children, before the temptation to try cigarettes, to protect them from nicotine addiction.
But it will probably be used by smokers to quit smoking.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not get any pleasure from smoking because of the nicotine vaccine, which can help them get rid of their habit," he said.
British scientists described the result as interesting, but warned of the need for much more research.
Even after the post-mortem, the actual cause of the tiger's death could not be ascertained.
The Forest Department is giving a go-ahead reply to this, saying prima facie the death of the tiger is natural.
On Thursday night, forest personnel of Ramnagar forest division found the body of a tiger near the Pawalgarh Conservation Reserve, Khichdi drain.
As all the organs of the dead body of the tiger were secured there were no marks of any wound or injury etc. on it.
The post-mortem of the tiger was conducted on Friday in the presence of forest conservator Vivek Pandey, deputy director of CTR Saket Badola, DFO Kahaksha Naseem, SDO GS Karki and veterinarian Hema Rathore.
According to sources, the tiger's internal body is said to be damaged during the post-mortem.
The exact cause of the tiger's death could not be ascertained.
The departmental officers continued to give a befitting reply on the death of the tiger.
However, the internal organs of the tiger have been sent to IVRI Bareilly for a topsicological examination to confirm the poison.
The death of the tiger can be said to be natural, forest conservator Vivek Pandey said.
No signs of poisoning etc. have been found from the tiger's body.
Yet for this, Bisra is being sent for a probe to confirm the poison along with a search of the surrounding area.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obide to us.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be examined by the State Karpson Watchdog.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joe Tripody has refused to refute the maritime strip policy at the request of his political guru Eddie Obaid, the patron of former New South Wales, who had hidden interests in government-controlled three lands.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday detailed its investigation into whether Mr. Obaid violated the circulars of the Pleas Policy from several state ministers where two restaurants and cafes owned by Obide were renewed without tenders after the expiry of their time in August 2005.
Lynn Ashpole, the former Deputy Chief of Staff, was aware of Mr. Tripoli's hidden interests after the evidence given on Thursday.
During the years of discussions in 2005, the government had put pressure on public tenders for leases to be introduced.
The lessees were against this and they wanted more time.
In 2009, the circular's enterprise for leases, which obide earned $25 million annually, was renewed with no lease tenders.
Shri Tripathi, who was the Minister of Dargahs from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of public tender.
But he refused to change at the request of Mr. Obaid, Mr. Tripodi had requested for a change in the government lease policy
In a phone call to ICAC in August and September 2007, Mr.Obide and Mr.Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had come to the fisheries department of Mr.Obide after working in the Ministry of Ports
Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wheley asked Mr. Tripodi. "Was the development of commercial lease policy being discussed in the telephone conversation of the case?"
"No," answered Mr. Tripod.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it certainly wasn't.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obi-Wan.
Officials say Israeli fighter jets launched a strike in Syria.
Israeli fighter jets targeted the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior administration official confirmed Fox News.
The officer did not say what the motive was, but there was at least one motive required.
The Associated Press reports that the target Russian missiles were the SA-125.
Israel has carried out air strikes on missiles inside Syria at least twice this year.
Foreign workers on a 457 visa can go through the "authenticity" test
The government is considering a "authenticity" test for foreign employees on a 457 visa, as it aims to extend a stringent action.
If adopted, the test will be implemented through a criteria designed to prevent the 457 used to fill unskilled positions in Australia or to be delivered to family and friends in a disguised manner.
A government discussion paper was released today, denouncing the government’s wording of foreign employees, former Labour MP Maxine McQueen today said it could anger Australia’s neighbouring countries.
He told the US India Institute today that "foreigners are reaching the end of the line" and that "Australians first job" rhetoric is a very unpleasant repetition at a time when unions have demanded a safe labor market.
Historically, this meant that white workers should have been protected – and I wouldn’t be surprised if some people in the area had seen a echo of that historical evidence.
The discussion paper outlines 12 measures that were previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met officials about the smugglers, has implemented five proposed changes, while the rest are under consideration.
If the "authenticity" criterion is adopted, the visa applicant can be examined as to "whether the nomination is true in circumstances in which the nominee is the relative or personal partner of the owner or the relevant person of the person sponsoring the visa."
Businessmen may need to keep a count of the number of 457 visa holders, as the first businessmen who wanted to sponsor a small number of employees hired hundreds of people.
Meanwhile, the 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker, died of a suspected heart attack after arriving in a refugee boat on Christmas Island this week.
The man's troubled nine-year-old son had come to Australia on a trip with him, and on Wednesday, after his father's death, an adult cousin of his has tied the shield, which was on the same vessel.
Australian authorities rushed the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The study has been announced by the British government to increase Scotland's benefits from the HS2 rail project.
The work by HS2 indicates high-speed services in Scotland and the northern part of England, which will begin soon with the first phase in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kremer said the project would "make the UK one."
Scotland's Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" to work with the UK government on the project.
The first phase will include the new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When the second phase is completed, the lines will reach Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the cost of building high-speed links between London and Northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The British government, which was negotiating with Scotland Transport, directed HS2 Ltd to consider further improving rail capacity and travel time for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of reducing the potential travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London by three hours or less.
According to Baroness Kremer: “Our goal for HS2 is the real national network, which will bring the UK and its cities closer together.”
We are moving forward with HS2, because its benefits will be much higher.
Without this, we will face problems related to the capacity of our rail network.
But it’s also about the connectivity of 18 UK cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be more well connected due to HS2.
According to Scottish Secretary Alastair Carmichael: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown appealed to Mr. Carmichael to "clear" Scotland's return to the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: “High-speed rail is likely to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland, but it will also increase the economic burden on Scotland in terms of high-speed rail across the UK.
We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the British Government to explore options to bring high-speed rail to Scotland, create benefits for all, and meet the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the investigation report with the ministers of the British government next year and taking a decision together on further action.
Aircraft electrical equipment rules will remain in effect in Australia
Despite a softening of equipment-related regulations in the US, Australian aircraft passengers will continue to turn off their tablets and smart phones while flying and landing.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left open the option for U.S. airline companies to change their procedures so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos, or play games on their devices during the critical stages of flight, provided those devices remain in "airplane" mode.
Passengers can do this on many flights right now, but many people don't like being able to access their e-books, etc., while flying and landing aircraft.
Australian aviation companies are considering the decision, according to which U.S. aircraft service companies will have to do a lot of work to meet this requirement, but they have indicated that they have no immediate plans to make changes to their processes.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was considering the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electrical equipment at critical stages of flight in Australia are still effective.
“Currently, CASA does not have any specific regulation regulating the use of electrical equipment in the aircraft,” the authority said, “the issue falls under the regulations, according to which the airline operations companies have to ensure that the security arrangements are always in place, and passengers have to comply with the safety instructions given by the crew members.”
Virgin, who is already in talks with CASA about expanding the use of its in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, is set to follow this change, but she asked to take further action on the regulatory directive.
"We will welcome the review by the CASA in terms of allowing the use of electrical equipment, as we really feel that it will provide a better experience to customers, as we now have (wireless in-flight entertainment) on our planes," the spokesperson said.
Kwantas said it would follow the current rules right now.
"As per our current policy, electrical equipment cannot be used while flying and landing aircraft, and we have no immediate plans to change it," it said.
FAA decisions apply to U.S. carriers.
By the way, we are always interested in regulatory developments that can benefit passengers and we will certainly consider the decision of the FAA and the reasons behind it.
The impact of this decision will vary on each U.S. aircraft service company and will depend on the age of their aircraft.
Aircraft service companies will be required to certify that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices, as well as amend their manuals, training materials, carry-on baggage programme and briefs to passengers.
"After verification of the endurance of their aircraft by airlines, it will allow passengers to use hand-held, light-weight electrical equipment such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones at all heights," the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their equipment while landing the aircraft.
The group has also suggested keeping heavy equipment safely under the seat or in the upper compartments while flying and landing aircraft.
Silver of Ponbrokers due to difficulty felt by the middle class in Singapore
Janani Amirthalinga is taking cash from her daughter's school fees by giving her a gold bangle, ring and earrings to pay for her school fees at the Bendmeier shopping centre in Singapore.
“My husband and I recently bought a house, so all our money is stuck in it,” said Mrs. Amirthalinga.
She says that, although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars (2,400 U.S. dollars) as an administrator, and her husband also does the job, the family’s monthly income remains insufficient.
In fact, there is a similar demand in parts of South-East Asia - where domestic debt is increasing - Valmax, where they are making their transactions, became the third pawnshop to be listed on Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Jewelry mortgages aren't the only way to get cash - 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Ms. Ameerthalinga - but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In Singapore, pawnbrokers typically charge 17 percent per annum, slightly higher than the 15.4 percent offered by the United Overseas Bank, which is a local lender that has a branch at the same shopping center.
However, pawnbrokers have the advantage of not requiring credit checks or proof of salary, and they can provide loans faster than the bank.
Lakhs of people are turning to Ponshops in the region due to the increasing cost of living by families and the difficulty faced by them due to increased domestic and consumer debt.
After five years of strong growth after the global financial crisis, and cheap credit due to simple monetary policy in developed economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to PonShop to meet their needs due to the slowdown in their economy.
This week's rating agency, Standard's Ange Poor's, called the rising domestic profit mainly due to rising mortgages, a risk factor for Asian banks' creditworthiness.
It said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest domestic debt proportion of GDP in Asia.
Malaysia tops the list with 80 per cent of GDP, compared to 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are concerned about high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which has emerged lightly from the tech slowdown this week.
On Thursday, data showed a sustained export slowdown and a decline in consumer demand.
"The deciding point is that with rising prices, people in the middle to lower classes [of the income scale] will try to increase their income in every possible way," said Song Seng Wun, economist at the Malaysian Bank, CIMB.
Historically high prices in gold prices over the past two years have led people to pledge personal assets, as they are taking advantage of the opportunity to capitalize on the value of their family jewels.
In Singapore, 70 per cent of the items pledged at the city-state's 200-poon outlets are gold.
People are saying, "The feeling of gold looks good, let's pledge grandma's gold chain, and take it back next month."
Ejimony, Thailand's largest pawnshop operator, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its outlet in recent months.
There is so much growth in the mortgage business that the operators of the outlet in Bendimir and 15 others like it in Singapore, not only in their neighborhood, are planning to expand to Malaysia where it has four stores, but also plans to expand outside Asia, says Yah Li Ching, executive director of Valumax.
The company will finance it, using 60 per cent of the 66 million Singapore dollars listed this week on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some discount lenders have been criticized for high interest rates, Ms. Yah says that mortgage lending not only offers cheaper rates compared to other lenders, but it also does not directly increase loans.
"Customers pledge items they already have, and encashing personal assets does not increase domestic debt," she says.
The social acceptability of Ponbroking is increasing in order to receive short-term and secure financial support.
It is not that the pawnbrokers are only used by financially weak people.
Rich people in Singapore also use the VALME<0x58> outlet, they pledge gold bars or Rolex watches, which can provide cash payments of up to 60 per cent of their purchase price.
We have customers from all sections of the society.
“These include wealthy individuals who need a short-term loan for business ventures or investments, or small businesses that need to meet their cash flow requirements,” says Ms. Yah.
Sometimes they just need money in a very short time.
India's largest businessman Mukesh Ambani and his wife Nita Ambani are celebrating their 50th birthday on November 1, 2013.
Neeta is celebrating her birthday not in Mumbai but in Jodhpur.
He organised a large party on the occasion.
Several Bollywood stars arrived in Jodhpur to attend the party. On the evening of October 31, several big stars were seen holding a flight to Jodhpur at the Mumbai airport.
The stars include Karisma Kapoor, Geeta Basra, Vinod Khanna and his wife Kavita Khanna, Abhishek Kapoor, Anu Malik, Shekhar Kapoor, Raj Kumar Hirani, Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra, Rahul Bose, among others.
Of course, you can imagine how big the water will be when such big names will join the party.
$325 million rescue package for the health of Taji
The Union government has stressed that there are strict conditions attached to the $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's ill-health system that will ensure that the state government does not waste funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibercek has announced that the Commonwealth is taking "immediate action" to address the current crisis caused by the aging population of the island state, high rates of chronic diseases, and system limitations.
The decision to finance over the course of four years was made in consultation with the government, with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has brought an emergency rescue package, which we believe will address the special challenges being faced by the state.
The $325 million package also includes an alternative surgery plan of $31 million.
2600 additional operations, including orthopaedic and cataract surgery, will help in resolving past accumulated cases.
It also includes funding for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Lawnsistation, better care after leaving the hospital, training of medical experts, mental health services and introduction of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals.
“These investments are in line with the best practices I’ve been told by leading physicians to improve Tasmania’s health system,” said Ms Plibersek.
The minister stressed that the government of Tasmania will face strict reporting and accountability regimes.
The state will have to maintain the current funding level to receive Commonwealth funds, and report each month on where the additional funds are being spent.
A three-member commission will be constituted to ensure that service is rendered by the State in the most effective and efficient manner possible.
Mr. Wilkie said that $325 million would not mean much, “unless real improvements are made to take Tasmania’s public health system to a more sustainable level.”
Yet he praised the government for responding to his request for immediate assistance, which he first brought before the Prime Minister in early May.”
“I hope the federal aid package will prove to be very helpful towards separating the state re-public health system from the crisis-hit list,” said Mr Wilkie.
According to the state government, these additional alternative procedures will largely undo the recent deductions.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is "band-aid solution."
"We are here for this reason because the Labour State Government has taken $430 million in its health system," he told ABC TV.
You can't take the state government's nearly half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth's $300 million as a good news day.
Mr. Dutton demanded that Ms. Plibersek should guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The conversion by Giulum Nicklaus of Dennis Diderot's novel details the best production design and time period, but it has gone far beyond what it should have been.
The novel, depicting the time of France in 1760, narrates the tragic story of Sujan, a young nobleman sent by his family members to Convent.
When she revolts, she faces extreme cruelty at the hands of the voluptuous victim Mother Superior, and becomes the object of sensual attraction for the other.
This film never goes into sexuality or sensation - and that's the problem.
Due to the seriousness of the narrative, there is also the risk of making a boring film for the audience.
CSA Vice-Chancellor Dr Munna Singh has decided to impose entry fee in the garden due to the dirt spread in the garden.
A 15-day ultimatum has been given to the departments to rectify the situation.
The Vice-Chancellor conducted a surprise inspection of the Deputy Director Seeds and Fields and Director Research with the Garden Department at 10 am on Friday.
During this time, he found more than a dozen employees, including directors in these departments, out of their seats.
After retaliating, he threatened to cut the salary if he was found absent the next time.
Dr Naushad Khan, media in-charge of the university, said a pass of Rs 30 will have to be made for a month-long trip.
On a daily fee of Rs 1 per day, people will be able to go to the garden and take a walk.
The system will work: The files related to various functions before the Vice-Chancellor will arrive under one system.
Not every employee will have the right to enter the Vice-Chancellor's office with his or her file.
The officers concerned will take their final call to the Vice-Chancellor.
The monitoring group said Syria had destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons.
The monitoring group said on Thursday Syria had destroyed critical equipment to produce chemical weapons and toxic gas war materials, while fierce fighting erupted in northern Syria, which is very close to the location where toxic agents are believed to be kept.
Also on Thursday, the Syrian movement group said about 120,000 people had been killed since the start of the Syrian civil war that began nearly three years ago.
The announcement by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons comes a day ahead of the last date of November 1
The Hague-based organization had designated Dumskas to destroy or "ineffective" all chemical weapons production units and chemicals used to mix and fill in toxic gases.
The completion of the initial phase of destruction is a significant milestone in this ambitious development that aims to destroy all of Damascus' chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Destroying equipment means Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Dumascus still has to destroy the existing weapons and collections.
Syria is believed to have 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and nerve agent sarin.
The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that the announcement came after clashes escalated in the city of Safira on Thursday, which experts believe is a chemical weapons production unit as well as a storage facility.
The movement group, which details the death toll through the movement's network in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children, it said.
The government said 29,954 President Bashar Assad is a member of the military, 18,678 are in favour of the government and 187 are Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
It also said that the dead included 2,202 army absconders and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated that nearly 100,000 people had died in the fighting since March 2011.
It has not updated the data since then.
Due to this conflict, about 20 lakh people have been forced to leave the country.
Assad's army battled the rebels for several weeks in Safira, many of whom belonged to al-Qaeda groups.
On Thursday, the Observatory said there were casualties from both sides, but did not explicitly say anything.
This war reflects the threat faced by inspectors of chemical weapons who, in a very short time-frame, have a mission to eliminate toxic weapons in Syria during the ongoing civil war.
The OPCW, which has worked closely with the United Nations, said its team is "currently satisfied and confirmed - and has seen all of Syria's declared critical production and mixing/filling equipment - destroyed."
It also said, "No further inspection activity is being planned."
Earlier this week, inspectors said they have completed the first phase of the verification process by visiting 21 of the 23 centres declared by Damascus.
The inspectors said they were not able to visit the two centres for security reasons.
On Friday, the OPCW said that according to Syria, the two centers had been "removed and ... chemical weapons products kept there were transported to other declared centers, which have been inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the unit at Safira was one of the two centres where the inspectors of the OPCW were not able to visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be approved by the Executive Committee of the OPCW next month.
In a statement issued by the OPCW, Ahmet Uzumku, Director General, Monitoring Group, said, “I salute the determination and courage shown by you all in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization.”
The civil war, which has been going on for three years, is mainly a conflict between the Assad government and its security forces, including members of the Shia sect, and rebel Sunni Muslims.
In other developments, Observatory chief Rami Abdurrahman said a powerful explosion had taken place Wednesday at the Air Defense Center in the Syrian coastal region of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is not yet known, he said.
The police have recovered the forged registry, forged seals, laptops and photocopies of the forged registry from the possession of the accused.
The Moti Nagar police have registered a case against all the accused.
Police Commissioner Paramjit Singh Gill said the accused have been identified as Rajiv Aggarwal alias Binttu of Chandra Nagar in Haboval, Kamal Krishan Jaswal of Jhumar Mandi, Gurinder Singh Gagagi of Kohada and Sonu of Jhumar Mandi.
Balbir Singh of the Registrar's Office (East) has absconded from the spot.
According to the police, the accused along with the clerk and record keeper of the registrar's office, Balbir Singh, used to extract papers from the records of the vacant and old lands and then buy new stamp papers and forged registry on them.
Not only that, the real registry was missing and forged in the registry records.
The accused then sold the land for crores of rupees on forged papers.
At the same time, they used to take loans on these forged papers.
After this, the real owner of the land used to remain a burgeoning account of the police and administration.
The accused, who had prepared the forged registry, kept a close watch on the lands of the NRIG.
Because there is no one to look after the land of the NRIG.
Therefore, it is easy to prepare and sell the fake registry of those lands.
During interrogation, the accused told that they have prepared around 150 fake registers so far, police commissioner Gill said.
According to the police, a case of cheating and theft has already been registered against the gang leader.
Anger over the death penalty for planning a bomb blast in Bali
Relatives and relatives of 202 people who were killed in the 2002 bomb blasts expressed outrage over the punishment given to those who planned the bombing, saying Omar Patek should face the firing squad.
Patek, who ran as one of the most wanted individuals in Southeast Asia for nearly 10 years, was sentenced to 20 years yesterday for his role in building the explosive device used in the bomb blast.
He can be released after 15 years on parole.
Umar, 45, was found guilty of mass murder by attacking two nightclubs in Kuta's famous tourist area, killing 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injuring a lot of people.
He was also found guilty of several other terrorism-related charges, including a series of bomb blasts at a church in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors had sought life imprisonment, though they could also demand that the man, who is said to be the infamous "destructive person" as the master making the bomb, be sentenced to death.
The decision rekindled the painful memories of Perth-based woman June Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters in a devastating attack by Patek and his co-conspirators a decade ago.
Stopping his hopes, he said Patek should have been given the death penalty.
I really feel that he should have been given the same punishment as other dreaded terrorists.
Ms. Cortine told AAP, "She should be put in front of the firing squad."
I have to live every day without my grandchildren and my daughters.
On October 12, 2002, immediately after 11 p.m., the club was decommissioned after a bomb detonated in a van parked outside The Sarai Club.
Peter Hughes was in the paddies bar at the time of the blast, exactly 20 seconds before a bag full of explosive material was detonated by suicide bombers.
They moved into a month-long coma as a result of this bomb explosion and died three times while on life-saving equipment.
Mr. Hughes says Patek should have received the same punishment as the three other members of the Jemmah Islamiyah terror group - Amroji, Mukhalas and Imam Samudra - who were sentenced to death four years ago.
In fact, this person should be sentenced to death before anyone else.
You see, there is no reason to keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and injuring countless people, 20 years of imprisonment is not enough.
Patek is the last person to be convicted of Bali bomb blasts.
He survived being held for nearly a decade, but was eventually arrested in January 2011 in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where the U.S. military killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent had submitted evidence that the report revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to re-establish contact between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al Qaeda.
"She didn't surrender," says Ms. Cortine.
Even to this day, the pain of hurting so many people is really not.
The decision, which came ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, will be marked by celebrations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year," said Ms. Cortine.
Patek can still appeal against his punishment.
FAA: Aircraft passengers can now use gadgets in the aircraft (but cannot make calls from cell phones)
Passengers will be able to use their electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch movies, listen to music - but will not be able to talk to their cellphones - under the highly-anticipated new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect these changes immediately.
At a news conference, FAA administrator Michael Huarta said how quickly these changes are implemented will vary in each airline.
The airlines will have to show the FAA how their aircraft meet the new guidelines, and how their crew members are updating the training manuals and the rules for collecting devices to show the guidelines.
The FAA has said it has already received plans from some airlines to extend the use of portable electronic devices on the aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the airlines that have already submitted plans.
The FAA said in a statement, "Based on the status of the plan, we can approve the extended use of the electronic device very quickly.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets, and other devices when the plane's door is closed.
They are expected to not turn on the aircraft until it reaches a height of 10,000 feet and is allowed by the captain.
Passengers are expected to turn off their devices again at the time of landing, and do not turn it on until the aircraft has completely landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are completely safe from electronic disruption can allow their passengers to use the device while flying, landing and taxiing by air, the FAA said.
Most new airline companies and other aircraft that have been modified in such a way that passengers can use WiFi at higher altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed these changes.
“When the policy is implemented in a safe manner — and we will work with airlines companies to do so — it will be a win-win for both sides,” Gladding said in a statement.
When it comes to this issue, we are fed up with feeling like "Hall Monitors."
But surfing, emailing, sending or receiving messages, or downloading data by connecting to the Internet at a height of less than 10,000 feet will still be prohibited, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So still no conversation with friends, online scramble-like games, the famous incident associated with which is that in 2011, actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone while the plane was parked at the door, and was taken off by American Airlines for refusing to turn off the device.
And heavy equipment such as laptops, etc. will still have to be collected as their bouncing will cause the other person to worry about getting hurt in the cabin.
Cell phone calls will continue to be banned during the flight.
The regulatory authority relating to phone calls rests with the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.
The FAA may lift restrictions on some electronic devices during the flight and landing of the aircraft.
Last month, Mark Rosenkan of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transport security expert at CBS News, said cell phones were still considered a risk.
"Cell phones are really serious issues, not just because they can potentially cause disruptions in navigation-related devices, but also because they can cause disruptions in cell phone towers when they are in the air," Rosenkar said.
The industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to probe the issue has recommended last month that the government should allow greater use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on the FAA has been increasing in recent years to reduce its use.
Critics such as Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo have said there is no legitimate security reason for the prohibition.
It is even more difficult to enforce these restrictions because the use of the device is ubiquitous.
Some studies also indicate that nearly a third of travelers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in the year 1996 when reports of disruption in navigation and communication equipment were received due to the passengers carrying FM radio and high-tech gadgets at the time.
The new airlines are more dependent on electrical systems than the previous generation of aircraft, but they have also been designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines have been proposing the use of Wi-Fi at cruising altitudes from passengers for many years.
Modified aircraft for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to disruption.
Huerta said most airlines must meet the eligibility criteria for greater use of electronic devices under the new guidelines.
Today's electronic devices emit much less power radio transmission than previous generation electronic devices.
For example, e-readers have a fairly nominal transmission during page flipping.
But transmissions are strong when the device downloads or sends data.
Amazon.com has also been one of the advocates of reducing restrictions on the use of the device by passengers.
In 2011, the company officials loaded their entire Kindle e-readers in the airline and blew them up to test the problems but found no such problems.
The FAA Advisory Committee has expressed mixed feelings about the risks posed by the use of the device.
Douglas Kidd of the National Aircraft Passengers Association said he believes the device's disruption is real, even if the risk is nominal.
Other members of the committee said, there are only reports described by the pilot in support of the device disruption in the aircraft system, most of which are very old.
However, the committee members recommended that the FAA allow the pilot to order the passengers to turn off the device when the aircraft is unloaded in low visibility.
The Travel Industry Group has welcomed the changes and has called them a common knowledge facility for people travelling in the latest era of technology.
We are pleased that the FAA has recognized that the passenger travelling with pleasure is not inconsistent with safety, rescue and safety, said Roger Doe, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
After learning about the serial bomb blasts in Patna, the UT police has geared up for a quick reaction during Diwali celebrations and during emergency situations in view of security.
A total of 1,800 constables will be patrolling and foot patrolling at all the main sites, crowded markets and other places in the city to ensure smooth functioning of the traffic system, prevention of incidents of brawl, teach lessons to the mobs and other perpetrators.
These personnel will include women police personnel including PCR, traffic unit.
Police personnel and commandos will also conduct duty-cum-record checks at hotels, guest houses and other places including PG in the city.
The SHO of the police station has been directed to constitute a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to investigate the case.
Apart from this, the DSP has been entrusted with the responsibility of conducting investigations in markets, malls and other places, including the VIP sectors of the city.
In view of the emergency situation and the convenience of the people due to Diwali festival, senior officers have also fixed the duty of additional police personnel in the police control.
The police asked the staff of the district administration to maintain high alert in case of emergency, including the fire department and PGI director, principal director and DHS, Sector 16 GMSH and Sector 32 GMCH management and other dispensaries.
In order to teach a lesson to manipulators, departmental officials have now put women police personnel and others on duty by naming 'anti-gunda staff' led by NGOs.
Police personnel of the Anti-Gunda staff team will be keeping tight vigil at crowded places including markets in plain clothes.
All SHOs have been ordered to install 44 nakas in the interiors of the city on Diwali.
Police personnel will also remain stationed at 38 Naka points along the city's borders.
The bird was released back into the forest by air for safety from the North Sea rig.
The bird that was found stranded on the North Sea Oil Rig has been released back into the forest by air transport from the coast.
The bird, known as the Water Rail, was sent to Aberdeen by a helicopter before the Scottish SPCA returned to its Eloa rescue centre.
Central manager Colin Seddon said: “This water rail was probably the winter migratory bird of Northern Europe, which was hit by strong winds over the North Sea.”
It seems that this bird was tired and took refuge on the oil rig.
He further explained: “It was unable to fly again so we were contacted for help.”
Before leaving, the water rail was healthy and fit.
Is the upper class of Europe ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April and a pledge was taken to bring business together and determine what changes the UK's employment and prosperity creators want to see in our relationship with the EU.
For that, we conducted the largest and most detailed survey of UK business leaders and asked them what they thought of the UK business with the EU.
U-Gov took the views of 1,000 business leaders, representing the UK's business size, regions and locations.
The results of this survey can be surprising to many people.
We found that a large part of the businessmen now want to export out of Europe, and focus on countries that are becoming modernized and growing, while EU member states are becoming sedentary.
They want the government to prioritize new trade relations with countries like China, India and Brazil, and not engage in the long-term and dire process of reforming the EU's mysterious institutions.
When asked about his views on specific policy areas ranging from monopoly regulation to product law, most business leaders believed that control of these decisive qualifications should come back to Westminster.
The general dissatisfaction with the single market could be seen very easily, with businessmen saying that the price of regulation of Brussels far outweighed the benefits of being part of Europe’s trading zone – even the vast majority of businessmen who traditionally favoured European companies, 40 percent agreed.
Finally and most frankly, our survey of business leaders found that, a large part of the world clearly wants Britain to move on the path of trade-based relations and treaty change, rather than politics with the EU.
The findings, which were seen in the levels of major business groups, showed that practitioners are pushing towards a "meaningful change" that would give the UK its lost power back.
It has a very high price - the issue of treaty changes for Britain and getting a better deal changed 16 percent of the vote in favour of staying in the EU, in the referendum.
The Prime Minister should not be in doubt: the survey shows that British businessmen support his plan to negotiate the terms of the UK's membership in the EU.
It also showed that practitioners expect to renegotiate the current power balance in favor of the UK by making a meaningful change.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and it is becoming increasingly imperative, as the eurozone is moving forward towards an all-encompassing economy and the fiscal union.
Priority must be given to jobs and growth in the UK, as the findings of our survey show that this means a new focused focus on business and a fundamental change in Brussels's regulatory procedures.
Alexey Miller of Gazprom calls the pipeline the beginning of a new era in Bulgaria
The head of Gazprom said the beginning of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marked the beginning of Europe's largest energy projects.
“Today is a historic event: Construction began on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream Gas Pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe,” Gazprom President Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element of energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream will diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
Officials said that a dispute between Gazprom's Counterpart and Gazprom over Ukraine, where Russia is the majority of its gas to Europe, presents a risk to traditional routes.
Miller said a direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant the "forever" cessation of gambling geopolitical risks associated with transit countries.
After the start of the entire project in 2015, Bulgarian customers will receive gas at discounted rates from the South Stream.
Gazprom said construction should start in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline has been designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Two YMCA employees charged with sexual offences before charges against Jonathan Lord, Royal Commission hearing
Before being charged against Caringbah child care employee Jonathan Lord in 2011, two employees of YMCA NSW have been charged with child sexual offences.
But in its statement before the commission, it said it had "never reported a case of child sexual abuse within its organization", the commission was told.
Chief Executive Officer Philip Hare was asked about the case in which a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences, and another case in which the YMCA Caringbah Gym Instructor was charged with child sexual offences against children living in her care in the year 1991.
Mr Hare, an advocate who assisted the commission, said he knew about the case at first, but he did not know about the second case.
He also admitted that the statement of YMCA before the Commission that "YMCA has been externally examined and found YMCA at the forefront of child protection" is also not accurate.
There is evidence before the Commission that the YMCA was notified, and it achieved the second lowest rating in four possible ratings in the Department of Education and Community Quality Audit in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who is associated with YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that the "including myself" management had failed because of the Lord's appointment, and failed to ensure that employees were clearly aware of their obligations related to reporting child safety policy violations.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual offences with 12 children during his two-year tenure at YMCA.
He was sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum of six years.
But Mr. Hare denied the suggestion that there was a cultural problem in the YMCA, due to which the employees did not report child safety violations by the Lord.
What the employees saw about the breach included the Lord spending time alone with the children, getting them babysitting privately, placing them in the lap, telling them he loves them and letting them play on his mobile phone.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under the supervision of the Lord, and had asked for child safety training, because he was concerned about his behavior, testified that the YMCA, which supervised the Lord, was "very threatening and difficult to meet most of the time".
The CEO stated that he did not accept the evidence of the employees that they were not comfortable in giving information above their manager.
He said that, rather, his friendship with the Lord misled his decision to inform him about it.
Mr Hare said he had provided his view to the YMCA NSW congregation that, from the "Jonathan Lord incident" the text for the organization was "about not giving information."
Mr Hare said the decision to sign the confidentiality agreement by the employees soon after the allegations surfaced was made by YMCA Child Services Manager Liam Whiteley.
He said the purpose was to avoid compiling evidence, but it was "excessive" and not executed correctly.
Stephen Smalbone, special professor of child sexual abuse at Griffith University, said YMCA NSW was not a safe organization during Jonathan Lord’s tenure between 2099 and 2011.
He said there were "serious problems" in the appointment, supervision, admission, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing has been adjourned to December 20.
Blair says he wants to return to the UK
Tony Blair said he would like a chance to become Britain's prime minister again - but he believes a comeback is unlikely.
In the night interview taken on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from the Prime Minister's Office, the 59-year-old Blair expressed his views on various domestic policies.
After leaving office in June 2007 after a decade as a leader, limiting most of his comments to his role in foreign affairs and representative of the Middle East group’s peacekeepers, Mr Blair largely avoided discussing British politics.
When asked if he would like to return to the post of Prime Minister, Mr Blair was presented by London's Evening Standard newspaper, saying: "Yes, of course, but that is unlikely to happen, so..."
He urged the leaders not to ignore the business community after the financial crisis.
When Cardiff gathered a crowd of horse-performing experts for the best horse of the year, they knew it would be a challenging competition.
But no one was ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Still not in school and a few months away from taking his first step, this little boy and his palate Shetland's Tutu Tafi easily completed three stages and won the top prize - she overtook her 30 adult rivals.
At the annual competition organized by the Sunnyback Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff, the unattainable pair - the Sk - was highly praised for its appearance, behavior and style.
In front of the men and women wearing beautiful bowler hats, he squinted his flat hat at a loose angle and made his two-year-old toffee round the ring.
The decision-makers praised Fenton for his natural ability to control who is far ahead of his age.
Toffee received the highest marks for his appearance and personality.
Fenton was given the toffee as a gift last March on her third birthday, and she has practiced with this tattoo of Shetland every day since then.
Her 30-year-old mother Donna said: "Fenton and Toffee are a fantastic pair."
They had to face the challenge from all the candidates, but they both won the Gold Cup and the Rosett.
This was only the second time he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we are all very happy with his win.
The most different in this landscape, he found everyone so amazing that they wanted to take photos with him.
The little boy from Nanteglo village near Abwell, South Wales, is walking on the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been performing horses for more than 10 years.
Mr. Howells said: “The whole place was full of excitement, and everyone was celebrating and clapping.”
He was running on sand all over the theatre, and despite being so small, he did an extraordinary job.
Fenton is a madman of animals - he loves horses, tractors, and farm, and he has reared two chickens that he cares for.
The way he's started, he'll be at the best horse exhibition of the year long ago - and I'm sure he'll perform very well.
A spokesman for the annual horse exhibition said: “Fenton is only three years old, but he comes to control his pony.”
They are a very good couple.
The judges gave the points in view of the manner in which Fenton and Toffee performed and the manner in which they performed in the show ring.
He saw good team work between Tutu and his rider - Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring in this case.
I’m pretty sure Fenton’s cute clothes have helped him, he really looked very different.
The Chinese newspaper will be the "resurrection" of the pleadings
A Chinese newspaper, which made an appeal on the homepage to release a reporter guilty of defamation, will be restored, a press regulator said.
GUANGZHOU's New Express newspaper had made a rare public plea for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribes to write fabricated news about the state-owned company.
The regulator said that the New Express now has to go through a "complete improvement."
The order of "improvement" came from the Guangdong Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television Administration.
"A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express of the Yangcheng Evening News Group had published a lot of false news about the listed company Joomlaion in the period between September 2012 and August 2013.
The regulator said in a statement that "the editorial management of the New Express was messy."
It said it had decided to impose "an administrative penalty by cancelling Chen Yongzhou's reporter's license."
It had “directed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a complete revamp of the New Express, recommending the New Express to investigate those responsible for it and the New Express leadership team to be urgently revised.”
Mr. Chen wrote many articles in the New Express blaming financial irregularities in a construction-equipment company called Joomlaion.
After he was banned, his newspaper published two homepage appeals for his release, saying it supported Mr Chen's journalism.
But after that Mr. Chen accepted to come on state television and write and publish false stories for money.
He told state broadcaster CCTV: “In this case, I have damaged Jumlayn, as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to win the trust of the people.”
I did this mainly because I was greedy for money and fame.
I have realized my mistakes.
Following Mr Chen's apology, the New Express issued a homepage apology, stating that it had failed to properly investigate his report.
Recently, many high-profile suspects have pleaded guilty to TV broadcasts.
Experts say that from time to time there is coercion, despite a law later this year prohibiting authorities from forcing a person to blame himself.

U.S.-Mexico drug tunnel found its own railway
One of the most complex drug trafficking tunnels between the U.S.A. and Mexico has been found to have its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.
U.S. officials have described a four-foot three-foot tunnel as one of the most complex secret passages ever discovered.
The tunnel is about six football pitches long, which connects Tijuana, a warehouse near Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
The area is filled with similar warehouses, which makes it easy to hide the truck being drug-filled.
Officials said it had been closed before a drug had passed through the tunnel.
According to court records, authorities have seized eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the discovery of the tunnel.
The three men, who were reported to be working as drivers, were charged with possessing marijuana and cocaine for the purpose of distributing them.
If convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison and life imprisonment.
Traffickers in Nogales, Arizona, take advantage of the huge underground drainage canals.
The tunnel is the eighth major route discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered since Central Mexico's marijuana harvest in October, challenging drug mafia groups capable of making the product reach consumers faster.

British police send extradition notice to Assange
British police today sent an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and pleaded for asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had sent an "arrest notice" to 40-year-old Australian Assange, for which he would have to appear at the police station, as well as that he would be responsible for his arrest if he failed to do so.
Assange is facing extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual offences, and his options under British law ended when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal against his extradition earlier this month.
Stockholm will hand him over to the U.S., fearing he had requested asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19, telling the South American country for political asylum.
A spokesman for Scotland Yard said the 40-year-old had “sent a surrender notice to Assange, which required him to appear at the police station on the date and time we chose.”
He is in violation of the conditions of his bail.
The embassy declined to comment on the police notice.
Assange fears that due to the release of more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on an anti-spam website called WikiLeaks, he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States to face possible espionage charges.
A fine of <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 (<0xC2><0xA3>1,000) for driving a car at 130 mph with a hot drink between the legs
The driver is fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 (<0xC2><0xA3>1,000) for driving a car at a speed of 130 mph (210 km/h) by placing a hot drink between the legs.
Andrew Howe, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was seen driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in Brentree on May 27.
When the police stopped them, they found a take-away drink of their feet.
In the Colchester Magistrates' Court, Howie has pleaded guilty to negligent driving.
Seven points were added to his license, resulting in him being banned from driving the car for six months.
He was also ordered to pay a fine of 90 pounds (<0xC2><0xA3>90) and a victim surcharge of 100 pounds (<0xC2><0xA3>100).
Tax on foreign property owners will end London's artificial status
The Finance Department has provisionally calculated the CGT measures, but is awaiting a final decision from Mr. Osborne, who in the 2012 budget had introduced stamp duty at the rate of 7 per cent for houses valued at more than 2 million pounds, and for individuals who prefer to have a house in a company instead of a separate individual.
Stamp duty from residential properties in the cities of Westminster and Kensington and Chelsa in the tax year 2012/13 was <0xC2><0xA3>708 million, already more than the combined sum of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber.
Mr Cook pointed out: "After the increase in stamp duty of high value houses and the introduction of the Associated Anti-Avoidance legislation, it is very difficult to argue that high value property has less than reasonable tax, which has nothing to do with the impact of the old council tax system.
He added that "but this move could silence some foreign investors in buying property in London and make them reluctant to sell to current owners."
Prime property, the top 5 to 10 percent share of the housing market by value in wealthy South-West London, stretching from Phulham to Wimbledon, has grown by a record 11.8 percent last year.
According to Sevils' research, the prices of central London continued to rise by 5.6 percent each year, but seemed to be slightly lower than the growing "domestic market", as the city's southwest, north (7.4 percent) and east (6.5 percent) surges.
Scientists have further shed light on the subject of what is the relationship between a dog’s tail movements and its mood.
Previous research has shown that happy dogs tend to move their tail more to the right (from a dog’s point of view), while restless dogs tend to move their tail more to the left primarily.
But now scientists say that fellow dogs can recognize this subtle distinction of tail and react to it.
The study has been published in the journal Current Biology.
"In humans, it's well known that the left and right sides of the brain are involved in the stimulus that generates positive or negative emotions," said Professor Georgia Vallartigra, a neuroscientist from the University of Trento.
Here we have tried to see it in other species as well.
They reported that the right part of the brain in dogs, like humans, was responsible for left-handed movements and the opposite order, and the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to unilateral dung shaking by other dogs, the researchers tracked animals while watching movies of other dogs.
They measured the heartbeats of pet dogs and analyzed their behavior.
It probably won't take long for us to understand why their dungeons sometimes move on one side and sometimes on the other.
Prof. Vellartigra pointed out: “We introduced dogs with dogs’ films – in a realistic version or in a shadow-picture to deal with other issues that are confusing, and we could see the tail movement and present the tail more left or right.”
When the animals saw a sentimental dog moving his tail to the right (from the dog's point of view), they were completely relaxed.
But when they saw the tail changing its direction and moving mainly to the left (again from the dog's point of view), their heart beat increased and they looked restless.
According to Prof. Vellartigra, they do not think that the dogs were communicating with each other intentionally through these movements.
Instead, they feel that dogs have learned from their own experience what they should be concerned about and what not.
He said: “If you’ve met other dogs many times, and if they constantly shake their tail one by one it’s related to more friendly behavior, and the right part presents less friendly behavior, you react based on the same experience.”
Researchers say these findings can provide owners, veterinarians, and trainers with better information about the feelings of animals.
Fellow of the School of Veterinary Sciences at the University of Bristol, John Bradshaw, a dog behavior expert, said this is not the first study to examine whether the left or right part is important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they see an aggressive dog and turn their heads to the right when they see a happy dog.
In another research from the University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: “Unlike the Italian study – when the robot dog’s tail moved to the left rather than to the right, dogs were more likely to get closer to it rather than restless.”
He said that this difference was because in various studies, dogs were not able to fully understand animals or robot dogs in films.
He explained that studying how dogs react to real dogs could help in this.
"While there has been considerable evidence from different mammals that the two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information is still to be obtained - and dogs are no exception in this case," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, it seems that it will probably not take much time for us to understand why their duplicity sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone Glasgow gig due to Alex Turner's illness
A rock bank named Arctic Monkeys has postponed Gig in Glasgow after its lead singer suffered from a conjunctivitis.
The Sheffield group was scheduled to perform at the hydro site in the city on Friday.
But his lead singer Alex Turner's illness forced him to reschedule the show's date.
The band's announcement came at a time when they were obliged to postpone the gig in a similar manner to the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on its official website, Arctic Monkeys said: "After the decision to postpone the show in Birmingham LG Arena tonight after seeking medical advice, Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the show on November 1, Friday in Glasgow Hydro.
"Alex Turner was found to have a shoulder injury in the investigation, and he is sadly not able to perform."
The show will now take place on November 20 at LG Arena in Birmingham, and on November 21 at Glasgow Hydro.
All tickets will be valid for the show.
We apologize for any inconvenience caused to all ticket-holders.
For any other assistance, contact the customer service of the box office from which you purchased the tickets.
Pope Francis will announce the name of the first cardinal in February.
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will create a new cardinal of the Catholic Church for the first time in his term on February 22.
Cardinals are the highest-ranking clergy in the Catholic Church, their rank is only below the pope, and they are the ones who elect the pope, so Francis will appoint the first group of his people, who will eventually help him choose his successor.
Currently, there are 201 cardinals.
By the way, Cardinals are not allowed to participate in the pope's election after reaching the age of 80 - they fall into the group of 120 "cardinal electors."
In a statement announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that before the ceremony to promote the new cardinals, a meeting of all existing cardinals would be held, which the pope calls the gathering.
“Pope Francis has already decided to announce his decision to hold a February pope-council to make it easier to plan other meetings involving cardinals from different countries around the world,” Lombardy said.
Catholic Voices' Jack Valero said the number of cardinal electors was likely to decline by February.
He said that in general, the number of cardinal electors is less than 120, the number of cardinals, and the names of cardinals over the age of 80, as they wish.
Valero said that next year's pope meeting would be important, as it would be the first pope meeting since Francis was elected in March this year.
At present, there is a kind of prejudice towards Europe and especially Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope, also nominates Cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of the Roman Catholics in South America are Catholics, but their numbers are very low in Cardinals.
The Cardinals Council - a group of eight cardinals from around the world whose task is to find ways to improve the church - will also be the first cardinals to be elected after being formed by Francis.
Before that, the Pope had to decide all things on his own.
“Just now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valerio said.
He said it was "possible" to seek advice from Francis Cardinals.
But we haven’t been in this situation before – it’s totally new.
Valero said that generally the Pope gives the bishop of large places the post of cardinal, but Francis was "totally amazing - so we don't know whose name they will announce."
GM recalls pickup trucks in U.S. to correct seatback
General Motors has recalled nearly 19,000 trucks to correct a shortfall in hand-turned seatbacks in its new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks, according to a notification from U.S. auto safety regulators on Friday.
In some trucks there may be a decrease in the front seat winding system.
As a result, the Union failed to comply with auto safety standards regarding seatback, head rest.
According to an information posted on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, "If the vehicle gets stuck from behind, it is possible that the head attendant may not be able to properly protect the driver, thereby increasing the risk of injury."
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
GM's trucks began to be shipped in June, and this represents the most important wagon launch for the top U.S. automaker since the 2009 bankruptcy renewal.
GM had informed the truck owners about the defect in late October.
The owner could not review the notification letter due to the 16-day government ban on the NSTMA, which had disrupted the increase in auto sales in October.
GM said on Friday that the sales of Silverado and Seera trucks, which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, were up 20 per cent in the first 10 months of this year.
In October, GM had sold 42,660 silverados and 16,503 sera pickup trucks.
On Friday afternoon, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) stock was up 1.4 per cent.
The Disappointment of Obama's Voters
I voted for Obama twice for change.
He says Obamas great efforts have been hampered by the GOPs policy of inhibition
Obstacle policy can't excuse drone attacks, troubleshooting Obamacare website
Obama's 2008 campaign is a reminder of what could have happened.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a lot of bad books these days.
This is a book about which I think this second year of medical school will boost my enthusiasm and give me a glimmer of hope.
It's called "The Courage to Win," and is a memoir of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I get tired of my patients’ slips at night and go to bed, this book takes me to a time where politics inspired millions of people and speeches could hold your breath.
The elections proved to be one-sided, and newsmen took a break to reflect the historical significance of the time.
There were tears of joy in the eyes of my classmates, and my parents saved every newspaper they received.
A group of young visionary people were on their way to the White House, and the whole country was ready for change.
He had an 82 per cent approval rating when he became president in 2008.
And then I closed the book.
The truth of the present is a harsh truth, such as coming back from the world of dreams.
It's hard to miss those days of hope - they seem to be a distant memory, a tragic memory of lost opportunities.
There was a real change after I voted for the first time.
Simply put, I could not have imagined any of this.
I credit Obama with a lot of achievements, from the Affordable Care Act to the withdrawal of our forces from Iraq, to the end of the "Don't Ask," killing of Osama bin Laden.
In addition, I believe that the policy of partisan opposition has stalled many of our country's efforts to move forward: immigration reform, public alternatives to healthcare, closure of bases on Guantanamo Bay, among others.
But there are countless times in which I find myself in front of my colleagues and colleagues in favor of the Obama administration, and I have the answer that I can give them.
I have reached the point of political despair.
Republican opposition policy is not the answer to the spying of foreign leaders, nor is it the answer to drone attacks on innocent children abroad.
It cannot respond by the National Security Agency to the collection of data about the personal lives of ordinary American citizens, nor can it respond to the prosecution of those exposed to the wrong actions of the government.
It cannot explain the reason for the killing of American citizen Anwar L. Awlaki without trial, nor the reduction of public funds and expenditure limits during the presidential campaign.
It cannot answer the findings of the report, which says that attempts by the White House to silence the media "have been the most aggressive ever since the Nixon administration."
And most recently, this cannot excuse the failure to design a simple website even three years after it was signed into law of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if I was expecting that.
If, at the age of 18, I should have guessed that the governance system could refute the political campaign that brought it forward.
The obvious is that the elected office is not a predictable path, as the opposition political party and random events such as the Newtown Massacre will shape our public discourse.
Yet the examples I have given above seem to be mostly chosen by the administration itself.
This is what bothers you the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was thrilled with his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and uncertain choice, which did not seem to determine his policies or his position.
I felt that a second term for Obama, free from the pressures of future elections, would fulfill the hopes we have been hearing for a long time.
Yet, while Obama’s approval rating is less than 45 percent this week, it has become much harder to return to the year 2008 through that book.
When I look at him, I remember the promises he had made.
A portion of the book was reading this week, describing how Clinton suffered a huge loss due to Obama in the Pennsylvania primary.
In a post-mortem campaign meeting, he told his subordinates that they needed to return to the track, and remain faithful to their objectives.
"I want my mojo back," he said.
We must remember who we are.”
Five years later, Mr. President, I cannot agree with you any more.
The views expressed in this comment are those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claimed that there is a conflict of interest of PM Tony Abbott about the parental leave plan
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer has said Prime Minister Tony Abbott's interest in the parental leave plan is conflict as his daughters can get pregnant, and take advantage of it.
Maharathi of the mining sector, who is in dispute over the payment of a $6 million carbon tax bill, has claimed while attempting to answer questions about the conflict.
Palmer could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial in determining whether carbon and mining taxes should be reduced.
But Mr. Palmer has claimed that only ministers can have conflict of interest, and said Mr. Abbott's daughters can personally benefit from the policies.
"They may have a significant interest conflict in terms of paid parental leave, because if any of their daughters are pregnant, they will have a direct interest whether they get a leave or not," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Election Commission has officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner of Fairfax's Sunshine Coast seat by 53 votes.
Mr. Palmer called for a revival of the counting of votes to speed up the process.
Tony Aut's daughters Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois and Bridget.
Should the outcome of the election come two months after we have voted?
"We should have a better system," he said.
Why can’t we have a system in which we can fill our variations on the computer, vote instantly and have a result at 6:30 in the evening?
Mr. Palmer also criticised the use of pencils for marking ballots.
That's because if a person doesn't like it, they can erase it.
In today's time, the use of pencils is absolutely absurd.
The Election Commission is studying the options for electronic voting, and recently released a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said his policies included the creation of an international airport for the Sunshine Coast, and that they would take their new work "very seriously."
Public office is for public service.
“We don’t need any other awards other than the history awards that we can serve the community at this critical time,” he said.
This caused inconvenience to the litigants.
Bar Association president Ramesh Singh Negi, while addressing a public meeting on the occasion, expressed his anguish over the deteriorating law and order situation in the state.
He said the fast-paced attacks on lawyers and their families prove that criminals have become fearless.
There is no fear of the police and the administration.
Referring to such incidents in different places recently, he said the safety of the common man can be easily gauged when the advocate society is not safe.
RBS suspends two Forex traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its Foreign Exchange Department, with the case getting information from two experts, another indication that the global investigation by regulators into the suspicious manipulation of the currency market is moving at a rapid pace.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in the investigation into the world's largest financial market, which exchanges $5.3 trillion each day.
The two traders will be the first employees of RBS, who have been suspended with the probe going on into the recurrence of the Libor Interbank loan manipulation scandal.
The bank declined to comment on the suspension, confirming that it had received a request for information from regulators this month.
Two weeks ago, the bank said, “We are continuing our investigation into the matter, and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators.”
Last month, experts from the case said that RBS had sent records of emails and instant messages sent to the former trader and sent them to the UK Regulatory, Financial Conduct Authority.
The trader named Richard Yousser left RBS in 2010, and is believed to have been discharged from his current position as the European head of forex spot trading at J.P. Morgan.
Rohan Ramachandani, the head of European spot trading in the city, went on holiday last week, while a former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been accused of any wrongdoing.
The instant messaging group of Mr. Yousser includes barclays and Citigroup bankers, experts said.
UBS said it has taken action against some of its employees this week after the Swiss regulator, Finma, was told that it was investigating suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market in many Swiss banks.
At least six global authorities - the European Commission, Finma, the Competition Authority of Switzerland, Vicko, the FCA, the Department of Justice in the US, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are investigating allegations of being sued by the bankers for their favourable fluctuations in the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, J.P. Morgan, and Credit Suisse have also conducted an internal investigation, or have received a request for information from regulators, said people familiar with the matter.
Banks have been closely scrutinizing instant messages and emails equivalent to many years in search of clues to any wrong activity.
The news about the check-in has created a stir among traders in the sector who have been among the most profitable individuals in the investment banks' trading unit for the past several years, but they are facing a challenge this year, as opportunities for bookmakers have come down due to low volatility in the currencies.
Some bankers tried to suppress the matter by saying that manipulating a very large and highly liquid forex market is impossible, but senior traders say it is not necessarily true.
The senior trader said that the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increased use of their own platform by banks, despite the extremely huge magnitude of forex buying and selling, means "you can start influencing the market at a slightly lower ticket price."
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that the trader would be serviced this week from its Exchange Traded Funds Desk in London, which had lost nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and is cooperating with its regulators.
“We believe the trader acted alone, and have been controlled,” Credit Suisse said.
Students studying technical and management courses, including those running on campus, will be able to exercise their franchise this time.
The university vice chancellor has written to the governor seeking permission to hold the elections.
With the commencement of the admission process in the university, the demand for holding of student union elections had started.
He had also launched a signature campaign to elect his representative to convey his voice to the university administration and college management.
Around two dozen courses, including BTech, MBA, pharmacy, biotechnology, bioscience, tourism management and paramedical science, will be able to choose their representatives this year.
More than 6,000 students studying here will get a chance to exercise their franchise for the first time.
Vice-Chancellor Ashok Kumar said that the Governor has sought permission to conduct elections in the university.
The date of the election will be announced as soon as it is allowed.
"""It is the responsibility of the college management to conduct elections in other colleges."
Many college managements do not want student union elections to be held on their campus.
However, due to lack of unity among the students, elections are not being held.
The council had launched a signature campaign for the elections.
Akash Jaiswal, Department Convener ABVP
After Diwali, the district administration will ask for permission to conduct elections in colleges.
The lack of clarity on the students' union elections is also causing problems.
On Dhanteras, people have bought a lot of gold and silver from utensils in the capital.
Such purchases have increased 20-30 per cent compared to last year
A large number of people thronged jewellery shops in Shimla.
From the lower market to the mall road, there was also a large crowd in the shops.
This year, however, there has been an increase in the prices of such items, but people still did not seem to be able to make purchases on auspicious occasions.
On Friday, it was 7:52 a.m. to 10:12 a.m. and 1:56 to 3:37 a.m. and 6:17 a.m. to 8:12 a.m.
At the time of the said three Muhurat, more crowds of people flocked to the suburbs including Shimla for more shopping.
In the Shimla Lower Market, people could not find a place to sit on their feet.
The same goes for every small store.
In such a situation, when shopping on Dhanteras, which is celebrated as Dhanteras, the Triodashi Dhanteras of the Krishna Paksha of the Kartik month, is a sign of auspicious Diwali.
Supreme Court upholds Obama's health care law
As a major victory for the Obama administration, the U.S. Supreme Court today declared the healthcare law constitutional in the name of Barack Obama.
In a 5-4 vote, the judges ruled in favour of a separate order of the Patient Safety and Affordable Care Act, which would require citizens to buy or pay health insurance before 2014, that it was constitutional under the power of the government to impose taxes.
Chief Justice John Robert supported four other liberal members of the court, while other judges Scalia, Thomas, Elito and Kennedy disagreed.
The court also supported the remaining paragraphs of the 2700-page law, saying that the condition of the healthcare law that states increase Medicaid eligibility or that they lose all federal Medicaid funding is not unconstitutional.
The petition was moved by 26 states and the National Association of Independent Business Federations (NCFI).
The legislation was opposed by all major Republican presidential candidates during the early 2012 session, including project nominee Mitt Rumney.
It is true that our work cannot be carried out without money.
Money is one of the greatest needs for living, but it is not in our interest to assume it all.
We celebrate Dhanteras on the day of Krishna Triodshi in the month of Kartik.
Dhanteras is worshipped as the god of wealth, Kubera and Yamraj, the god of death.
Money has an important place in our religion and life.
No money is good or bad.
We have a bad feeling about money.
There can be no more valuable thing than the money which is useful for the welfare of humanity, but the money which causes arrogance makes no sense.
Let us earn money for the holy purpose and spend for the holy purpose only.
It is the duty of every person to earn money for the maintenance of the family.
It should also have a sense of spending on society, but unaccounted collection or the tendency to earn money destroys our conscience, personality.
The spirit of giving should always be in the mind.
A fraction of the money you give can also form the basis of one’s life.
We should all think about the fact that many people in the society are living in dire straits.
In fact, in the Puranas of life, equal importance has been given to meaning, religion, work and salvation.
Everyone wishes for wealth and success, and according to their effort, they also get wealth and success.
It is the same wealth that is sustainable with which respect is attached.
No matter how rich a criminal may be, he can neither consume it properly nor benefit anyone else.
Don't waste your money on someone else.
True wealth is the one who makes the way to flow in the infinite hands of wealth.
There can be no better use of money than creating jobs for others.
Another thing, money is not just in the form of money.
It would also have been in the form of your health, character, love for others.
Try to be the owner of that money.

Special judge Ismail Mehta has sent Ahmed to 14-day judicial custody after hearing the NIA's plea in the closed-door case.
According to sources, Uzair Ahmed, the main accused in the Patna serial blasts case, along with Indian Mujahideen members Imtiyaz Ansari and Haider, were involved in the incident.
Ahmed had met several other terrorists from Ansari.
The NIA also wants to arrest the other accused in the case.
In this case, the search for the bomb-making material and the terrorists who made it is still underway.
For this, Ahmed has to be taken to Bihar, Jharkhand and several states, for which he needs to be taken on remand.
The NIA had on October 30 arrested accused Uzair Ahmed from Ranchi in connection with the Patna serial blasts case.
A day earlier, the Special Task Force (STF) had revealed that there was a forgery in the 2012 PMT.
The STF has found a glitch in the roll number of 700 students in the investigation.
Out of these, about 125 students had taken admission in medical colleges.
Now the admissions of these students can be cancelled.
After the STF disclosures, the medical education department has started brainstorming to cancel the admissions of these students.
According to the information, the department is waiting for the list of all these suspected students to meet the STF.
The list will be sent to Vyapam to revoke the eligibility of the students involved.
However, the department is also seeking legal advice in this regard.
According to the departmental officials, since the students who took admission in 2012 have completed one year, it is necessary to seek legal advice in this regard.
The medical education department officials are not in a position to say anything as the matter is limited to the STF investigation.
Vyapam director Tarun Pithore said if the STF submits a list of suspected students with evidence, their admissions will be cancelled immediately.
Director Medical Education Dr Nirbhay Srivastava, however, said that he has not refused to cancel the admission of the students if they are found to be correct.

Out of these 345 medical education departments, 84 admissions have been cancelled so far.
Poonch MLA Ejaz Jaan inaugurated the water cooler at the Gurudwara complex.
The MLA said a large number of people used to visit the gurdwara, but due to lack of proper drinking water arrangements, water coolers have been installed here.
This will allow people to get cold water on hot days.
Clean water will be available during the winter season.
This will solve the problem of drinking water for the devotees.
Members of the Gurdwara Committee and others were present on the occasion.
After the general elections, if the new government continues its policy of discontinuing the sale of kerosene through ration, there will be no kerosene at these shops in half a dozen states.
The states where the sale of kerosene is to be stopped are Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand.
Apart from this, the sale of kerosene is also set to be stopped in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and some states in the northeast.
According to sources in the petroleum ministry, it will be decided to discontinue the sale of kerosene at PDS shops in the states on two grounds.
The first is the rapid construction of electricity connections in rural areas.
The second base is the LPG connection.
That is, the sale of PDS kerosene is being stopped in the states where most of the rural households have been given LPG connections.
The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas has taken steps in this regard.
The sale of PDS kerosene in Delhi has already stopped since October 2013.
According to sources, under this policy, kerosene quota has been reduced significantly in Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand.
The quota in Punjab has been reduced from 2.72 lakh kg to one lakh kg.
In Uttarakhand, kerosene quota was reduced by 70 per cent, while in Haryana it was reduced by nearly 40 per cent.
Despite this reduction, there has been no report of shortage of kerosene from these states.
The ministry believes that it is clear that kerosene has been used for adulteration.
The price of PDS kerosene and diesel is currently at Rs 37
This will encourage those who are struggling.
In states where sales through PDS will be stopped, oil companies will sell kerosene at full price in the open market.
At present, oil companies are losing more than Rs 39 per litre on kerosene.
In 2013-14, the burden of kerosene subsidy is estimated to be around Rs 31,000 crore.
The accused used to open the accounts of the investors citing the trading firm and forgery in the name of buying and selling the shares.
This is probably the first time such a revelation has revealed a fraud worth crores of rupees in the state.
The police have not been able to reach him yet, but seven people, including the accused, have been taken into custody by the police.
The gang operated a fake commodity market under the name MetaTrader-5.
The company's agents used to take cash from investors and make fake IDs on a fake software.
This led to the purchase of shares of investors by the accused.
It was then that he realized at what price it was purchased.
In fact, no shares were bought or traded, as no demat account of investors was opened and shares were shown to be false on this fake software.
Police suspect that hundreds of people have been arrested in connection with the incident.
Every investor used to invest between Rs 2 and Rs 5 lakh in the name of making profits.
The main accused, Amit Soni, has been detained by the cyber cell from Jodhpur while his six other associates have been arrested from Indore.
According to ADG Cyber Cell Ashok Dohre, any stock trading company is required to join the stock exchange as a trading firm.
Only then can the company trade shares through its investors.
Then the investor's demat account is opened so that shares can be bought and sold for him, but the company called MetaTrader-5 was neither associated with an exchange nor traded stock.
The company bought the server for itself on September 24, 2012, citing trading in the name of Wintrade.
Since then, people have been complaining about the investment through this company.
At present, eight businessmen from Indore have come forward to lodge a complaint with the cyber cell.
Even after selling their purchased shares in profits, their amount was not transferred to the account.
In this regard, he started asking for a profit amount from the company's actors.
Investors are even saying that on the fake ID given to them, the price of their purchased shares was always low.
This price was fixed by the accused at his own level.
The company has appointed its CEOs and agents in Rajasthan, MP and Maharashtra.
Agents advised people to join the company by offering more profits.
After this, Rs 2 lakh was deposited from someone and Rs 5 lakh was deposited from someone.
On the day of the Test, the players of this team keep creating new records and now their status in ODIs is also seen gradually increasing.
A good example of this came on Thursday when a well-placed New Zealand team defeated Bangladesh to take an unassailable lead in the ODI series.
Sohag Ghazi and Mashrafe Mortaza took an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series as Bangladesh defeated New Zealand by 40 runs in the second ODI.

For New Zealand, Ross Taylor was the top scorer with 45 runs while Corey Anderson scored 37 runs.
Kyle Mills contributed 27 not out, while Nathan McCullum contributed 25 runs, but none of the team's batsmen could turn the good start into a big innings, leading the team to a loss.
Earlier, Bangladesh were bowled out for 247 in 49 overs despite a half-century from Tamim Iqbal (58).
James Neesham and Anderson picked up eight wickets each.
Anderson took four for 40 while Neesham took four for 53.
Tamim has become Bangladesh's highest run-scorer.
Tamim, who surpassed Shakib Al Hasan, has scored 3702 runs in 124 matches.

Punjab State Power Corporation is earning crores of rupees per day at the recently-concluded Gate City Circle Office Khandahar Building.
In such a situation, all the employees are forced to work in fear of accident.
In the coming days, there is an atmosphere of fear among the staff working on the roofs of this building due to the fall of cement.
The building, built in 1913 during the British era, was the first municipal corporation office.
The building was handed over to the Electricity Board in 1995.
The department is working on its repairs by doing only colour grading.
The condition of the building is so bad that employees are also afraid to sit in it.
The condition of the building is so bad that the plaster often falls from the roofs.
In the last one month, cement has fallen from the roofs of four rooms.
A woman employee was also injured in the incident.

BJP<0x60>s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, who arrived in Pune to inaugurate a part of the Dinanath Mangeshkar Hospital, launched a scathing attack on the Congress at an election rally on Friday.
"""There was a coalition government in many states and at the Centre, sometimes there was a Congress government, sometimes there was a Communist government, sometimes there was a BJP government,"" Modi said."
You have seen the rule of several parties.
I call upon the political pundits and economists of the country.
Some parameters should be fixed in the country.
What did the team do?
If this results in a comparative result, the question will not come before the country whether the BJP government should come or not.
Wherever the BJP government is formed, efforts have been made to fulfil the aspirations of the people.
This country is witness to the low inflation in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Morarji Desai governments.
The poor man had two meals.
But when the Congress or its support government was formed, the poor man did not suffer.
Not a single Congress leader, not a single UPA leader is responding to what he has done in nine-and-a-half years.
Even the media of our country does not reach them.
The Congress has become disillusioned.
They don't even respond to the media.
It is the Lok Sabha election, you have to answer to the people.
"Taking a jibe at Congress leader Kapil Sibal, Modi said, ""On this day, questions are being asked to Modi."
In a democracy, not a ruler in Delhi, servants should sit.
There can be no Nath in Delhi, there should be only slaves.
Friends of the Congress continue to leave the balloons on the coming day.
Friends of Congress, we have already taken the exam 10 months ago.
In a democracy, people take the initiative.
Google, Samsung and Huawei have been sued in connection with the Nortel patent case.
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, on Thursday filed a number of lawsuits against Google, including cell phone manufacturers, which it overtook in the Nortel Insolvency auction.
The association, called Rockstar, which bought Nortel Patents for $4.5 billion, has sued Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, HTC Corporation, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement at the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google has been accused of violating seven patents.
The indictment said the patent also includes a technology that combines search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, which is a key part of Google's search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not be contacted immediately.
Samsung, Huawei, and HTC all make phones that run on Google's Android operating system, which is tougher than Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made a $900 million initial bid for Nortel patents.
Google has increased the bid several times and finally offered $4.4 billion.
After losing to Rockstar at Nortel Patents, Google bought Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, one of the main reasons Motorola had a long list of patents.
"Google has violated, and continues to violate, despite losing in an attempt to acquire patents-in-suits at the auction," the indictment said.
Rockstar has sought increased compensation against Google because it claims that Google's patent infringement is malafide.
Believed in Egypt's first freely elected president
Mohamed Morsi has taken the oath of office, but his Victory Day could hardly end the political struggle in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi, who was ousted 16 months ago, promised a "new Egypt" while sworn in as the country's first independent elected president.
On its formal establishment before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi has become the first elected Islamic president of the Arab world, and the fifth President of Egypt, after the removal of the monarchy nearly 60 years ago.
He took the oath on his chair before 18 judges of the court dressed in black, on the banks of the Nile, which looked like an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are looking forward to a better future, a new Egypt and another republic," Morsi said during a formal ceremony broadcast live on national television.
The radical group Muslim Brotherhood, which has spent 84 years since its founding as an unlawful declared organization, and which has been targeted by previous governments, said the 60-year-old Morsi, a trained engineer in the party’s U.S., “Today the Egyptian people have laid the foundation of a new life – complete freedom, true democracy and stability.”
Hundreds of soldiers and police escorted the building and arrived at Morsi in a small convoy of cars shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Since Mubarak's time, only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court to congratulate the new president, traffic was also stopped for a while so that his motorcade would run out of a busy street that connects the city centre to its southern suburbs.
Morsi's personal prestige, ridiculed as a "empty tire" of the Brotherhood, increased greatly after his victory, and his speech on Friday presented him not only as an Islamist but as a candidate for all those who want to complete the 2011 revolution against dictator Mubarak.
Wearing a blue business suit and a red tie, Morsi took the oath of office before the judges sitting in a wooden paneled chamber, saying, "Today Egypt is a citizen, national, constitutional and modern nation."
Morsi then went to Cairo University, where he was to deliver his inaugural address.
He was given an official welcome by the military band playing the national anthem while standing in the posture of caution.
Military ruler Field Marshal Hussain Tantavi was also present on the occasion.
Upon his arrival, hundreds of people present in the lecture room at the main university there were greeted with the slogan "Army and people are one hand."
Founded in 1908 as the bastion of secular education, the University of Cairo later became the bastion of Islamic student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi on Friday took a symbolic oath in Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the revolution that ended Mubarak's dictatorial rule last year, and took an oath to take back the president's powers removed by the military council from his post from the ousted leader last year.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the Court instead of taking an enabling oath of Parliament, they bow down to the will of the Army, which is an indication that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech at Tahrir Square was full of dramatic popular currencies.

Secretary of State John Kerry unexpectedly acknowledged that in some cases U.S. espionage has exceeded the limit.
At the same time, he claimed that innocent people have not been tortured under the intelligence surveillance programme.
Kerry's confession came while addressing the annual summit of the Open Government Partnership held in London via video link.
"I assure you that innocent people are not being tortured in this process.
But in some cases inappropriate methods have been adopted in an attempt to gain information.
Meanwhile, an important committee of the US Congress has approved a bill limiting the surveillance activities of the National Security Agency (NSA).
Its aim is to make surveillance more transparent and restore the confidence in the public that has been hurt by the disclosure of large-scale phone tapes.
The move has been welcomed by six US companies, including Google, Yahoo.
The NSA has also cracked down on these companies' data centres.
The Select Committee of the Senate on Friday passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Reform Bill (FISA) on the NSA by 4 votes against 11.
The bill mentions a number of restrictions, including a ban on one-time phone tapes under the US Patriot Act.
Under the FISA, knowingly collecting and using data illegally would be considered an offence and a jail term of up to 10 years has been provided for it.
The bill will become law once it is passed by both the Houses of Representatives and the Senate.
The committee chairman and Senator Diane Festin said the NSA's phone recording program is under law and I believe it has made a significant contribution to the security of the country.
But in spite of this, more transparency should be brought in.
Not only this, the security of the privacy of the people should also be taken care of.
Meanwhile, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, AOL and Facebook have backed the bill, angered by the NSA's Internet surveillance program being exposed.
In a letter to Senators, the companies said they welcome the proposal of MPs who have curbed the NSA's massive phone record.
It is worth noting that the documents issued by former CIA employee Edward Snowden removed the cover from the NSA's actions.
The international community is outraged after the NSA's telephonic conversations with heads of states of 35 countries, including Germany and France, came to light.

The next hearing of the case against Musharraf is on November 11.
In 2007, Ghazi Abdul Rashid was killed in a military operation against militants hiding in the Lal Masjid.

According to the police, Musharraf was not directly involved in the killing of the cleric.

The company has increased its full-year profit forecast, and is expecting record profits from holidaymakers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel company expects its full-year underlying profit before tax to be between $325 million and $340 million, while the previous forecast said it would be between $305 million and $315 million.

According to a recent media report, the NSA has flown information from Yahoo and Google's data centers for spying.
The Washington Post made the disclosure based on documents collected by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
According to the report, the NSA's programme was called Muscular, which it conducted in collaboration with its British counter-part-GCHQ.
The two agencies stole data from Yahoo and Google’s massive fiber optic cable network.
The Washington Post quoted a top-secret document dated January 9, 2013 that said more than 18 million documents were collected within 3 days of the start of the program.
These include email, text, audio and video messages.
According to the Washington Post, the program was run outside the US and a Anonymous telecommunications provider helped the NSA gain access to this information.
According to the newspaper, it was much easier for the NSA to run the program outside the US, as court orders are required for such operations in the US.
NSA Chief General Keith Alexander denied the allegations at a press conference in Washington, saying, "As far as I know, it never happened.
The NSA has always gathered all the information within the ambit of the law.
The NSA was recently targeted for spying on the German Chancellor.
The United Nations said Wednesday that the U.S. administration has assured its communications system will not be monitored.

Schools to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In English literature courses, students must read at least a play by Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and a contemporary British story after 1914.
The exam will also include "not seen text" to encourage greater reading.
A joint English literature and language course will be terminated.
From the year 2015, students will have to take a separate GCSE in the language, and there will be a lot of induction to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Department of Education will release new courses for English and Mathematics tomorrow - both of which will be the first subjects to undergo revolutionary changes.
It will also change into other major topics next year.
In a separate step, the exam will showcase the changes in the structure of the GCSE with regulatory off-kilter, new grading system, and less curriculum.
Speaking in the summer, Education Secretary Michael Gove said that "there was a lot of consensus that we need to improve our examination system in order to restore people's confidence", adding that "GCSE will be "more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous."
Studies found that English schools devote less time to mathematics - 116 hours a year or 3 hours a week during a session than in most countries.
According to the comparison, Australian schools offer students an average of 143 hours a year, while Singapore has an average of 138 hours.
While there was no formal need to give more time to mathematics, coalition sources said that the extensive mathematics GCSEs - combined with the subjects in the league table - were likely to encourage additional teaching in schools to be provided.
This course will focus more on “real world problems” including financial mathematics.
The Supreme Court refused to stop media reporting.
The Supreme Court said it cannot ask the media not to report information received from the police or any other source.
Asaram's counsel said that Asaram is being called Dracula in this case.
There is a guideline for reporting in this case but it is not being followed.
On this, the Supreme Court said that you have many other remedies which can be used.
Asaram's counsel said there are thousands of news papers and 100 news channels across the country, but there are two channels in particular, which are more troublesome to him.
These people are damaging their image and reporting unilaterally.
In this case, the right of Asaram should be protected.
The court refused to restrain the media from reporting, but told Asaram's counsel that he had other legal remedies that he could use.
Pawan Bansal, who was surrounded by opposition questions at the railway gate, put the opposition in a spot saying he had not seen any woman in 15 years.
After that, everyone was surprised at where the woman came from in the middle.
Perhaps Bansal was referring to the domestic relations of a big BJP leader and a councillor.
Turning the matter to the media, Bansal told reporters that the BJP had conspired to get a complaint by putting a woman behind them during the last parliamentary elections, which did not succeed.
Talking to reporters, Bansal said the CBI had questioned him in the railway bribery case.
If they were to be made witnesses in the case, would they have been made after a thorough investigation?
Bansal said that in the booth scam that he was talking about, he had written a letter to only one needy person.
If they do, they will be punished for their sins.
He said though the Nigam had no constitutional right to raise the issue in the House, he himself asked the opposition to speak.
He said as far as development works are concerned, the opposition will be given a list of 15 years of development works.
They cannot even think about the way Chandigarh is growing or is going to be.
The two exchanged greetings at the Cabinet meeting.
At the end of the meeting, Singh praised the Chief Minister's speech for his retaliatory attack on Narendra Modi at the Chintan camp.
He also said in his speech that he had no other feeling in his mind.
They want the party to be strong.
New challenges need to be tackled.
It was the same sentiment on the face of the Chief Minister that he took Singh's speech in a positive manner.
Singh had requested the Chief Minister to respect the workers at the Chintan camp and protect them from alleged harassment of officers.
However, he had also said that he was ready to resign from the Cabinet to keep his word.
By the way, after the opinion that emerged in the Chintan camp, fresh consideration is expected in the matter of putting workers in government posts.
At the camp, state JD(U) president Vashisht Narayan Singh had said that the nomination of workers in the 20-point committees would be announced soon.
It was also a sign that the list was almost ready.
There are reports that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will now inspect the list from his own level.
They will also examine whether the opinion of the MLAs and MPs has been taken in the making of the list.
The list will be revised extensively to accommodate old and committed workers, if required.
The common allegation of MLAs and MPs is that they did not seek their opinion in making the nomination list.
While the names of those who came much later from other parties have been included in the list, many important activists active since the days of Samta Party have been neglected.
Some people are born with a silver spoon, some make life ideal by their hard work and people take inspiration from them.
One such person also has a name of Late Dhirubhai Ambani.
Dhirubhai Ambani was born on December 28, 1932, the third son of Hirachand Goverdhandas Ambani, who was a teacher at a school in Chorwad, a small village in Gujarat.
Among the five siblings, Dhirubhai was third.
The five children of the family include Ramniklal, Natwar Lal, Dhirubhai and two sisters Trilokana and Jasumati.
Due to financial constraints, Dhirubhai had to leave school only after high school.
Dhirubhai started helping the family financially in childhood.
At this time they used to set up a Bhajiya shop near Girnar, the income of the shop was limited to the number of tourists coming here.
Talking about Dhirubhai's first job, in 1949, at the age of 17, he arrived in Aden, Yemen by a ship named Kabota.
Here his elder brother Ramaniklal had made all the arrangements for him, so he had no problem getting jobs abroad.
But something else was going on in Dhirubhai’s mind.
So in 1954 he returned to Vatan.
In 1955, he tried his luck by putting Rs 500 in his pocket.
This is where his professional journey began.
From here, Dhirubhai Ambani took such steps that he never looked back.
His name was known not only in the country but also abroad.
Dhirubhai Ambani left the world on July 6, 2002.
At this time, he was the owner of Rs 62,000 crore.
Currently, his son Mukesh Ambani and son Anil Ambani are in charge of the government.
Like his father, the names of these two brothers are also among the international level businessmen.
Who doesn’t know the Ambani family today?
Dhirubhai, Kokilaben, two sons Mukesh and Anil Ambani and their wives Nita Ambani and Tina Ambani.

Killing mosquitoes is going to be expensive to avoid diseases like dengue, malaria, filaria.
The state government is going to triple the tax on transplants, mats, liquids used to kill mosquitoes.
The proposal for tax hike will be placed before the Cabinet soon.
The government, which is facing a financial crisis, is exploring all possible ways to increase its earnings these days.
A resource committee has been formed under the chairmanship of Urban Development Minister Mohammad Azam Khan to improve the financial health of the government.
According to sources, in a recent resource committee meeting, the committee rejected a number of proposals to increase tax, which would have a direct impact on the general public.
However, the committee has given its nod to the proposal to increase tax on mosquito repellents, quails, mats and liquids.
It is proposed to triple the tax on them.
Currently, there is an additional tax of 4 per cent and one per cent.
It is now taxed at 12.50 per cent VAT and 1.50 per cent additional tax.
The government is expected to get an additional revenue of around Rs 14 crore from this.

The committee believes that the Tendu leaf is used to make the beedi that people from the lower classes drink.
Similarly, the committee has not given a green signal to increase tax on transmission wire etc. electrical goods, saying that this could have an impact on the general public on the cost of electricity.
The committee has also not accepted the proposal to impose a green tax on renewal of commercial vehicles.

SRINAGAR: The security cover of former minister Ghulam Hassan Khan, who joined the Congress from the People's Democratic Party, was allegedly removed by the police.
Khan blamed the state government for this, saying his security has been removed for political reasons.
Ghulam Hassan Khan, who won the election in 2002 on a PDP ticket from Shopian, joined his cabinet when Mufti Muhammad Saeed was the chief minister.
Ghulam Hassan Khan said that I have got the security cover since 1996.
I live in a place called the heart of terrorists.
A security team of CRPF was deployed at my house under the leadership of Sub Inspector.
There are bodyguards with me too, but all my security was suddenly withdrawn on Veerwar.
When the security team was going from my house, I spoke to the Deputy Commissioner and the District SP.
But instead of reinstating security, he said he would investigate the matter.
However, when contacted in this context, IGP Kashmir Abdul Gani Mir denied any information about the matter, saying it was a sensitive matter.
I will myself examine how the security of a former minister and a senior political leader has been removed.
State Congress chief Prof Saifuddin Soz said that there is no such thing in my knowledge.
If the security of Hasan Khan has been compromised, it is a very serious matter.
I am currently in Jammu coming to Kashmir in the next two days.
I will discuss this issue with the concerned administration.
According to the report, the UPA government has spent Rs 8.5 crore in the last four years to celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel.
In contrast to Modi's claims, during Atal Bihari Vajpayee's tenure as prime minister (between 1999 and 2004), there was a period when no advertisement was issued by the government over Patel for two consecutive years (2001-2002).
Laying the foundation stone for the 182-metre statue of Sardar Patel at Kevadiya in Gujarat, Modi said, "Earlier there was no advertisement on the occasion of Sardar Patel's Jayanti.
While DAVP records show that the UPA spent Rs 30 lakh in 2009-10, Rs 4.10 crore in 2010-11, Rs 2.7 crore in 2011-12 and Rs 1.4 crore in 2012-13
When asked about Modi<0x60>s claims, Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewari said the BJP<0x60>s PM candidate does not speak on the basis of facts.
The UPA did not bring any advertisement on Patel in the year 2008.
He said that this was due to the economic slowdown that year.
However, the amount spent on the advertisements of Sardar Patel is much less than the amount spent on the Jayantis and Purnimas of the Nehru-Gandhi family members every year
The DAVP spent Rs 33 crore on print advertisements for the birth and death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, Rs 21 crore for former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, Rs 14.5 crore for Indira Gandhi and Rs 9.38 crore for Jawaharlal Nehru.
When asked about this difference, Manish Tewari said, "It should not be seen from the point of view of expenditure on advertising.
Because the price of advertising depends on many things, such as the size of the ad or the rate of the ad for that year, etc.
The real thing is that it shows our dedication, the people who oppose it without knowing about it are trying to take over the legacy of a great leader.

Moving through soil, rivers and forests to provide free medical care
Dr.George Well is providing free healthcare in rural areas of Cameroon
Well and his team see hundreds of patients on nearly every weekend
There are not many doctors in West African countries; there is only one doctor for 5,000 people.
Give your vote here or via mobile
Dr. Georges Well is one of the top 10 heroes of CNN in the year 2013.
You can vote to make CNN the hero of the year for them or someone in the other top 10.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Well had seen his ailing father go to the hospital, unconscious and unconscious, who was not properly equipped to help him.
Jameel Well was injured in a car accident near Cameroon's capital Yonde in 1981.
Initially, he only had a broken hand, but an infection spread to his brain, and he developed a hemorrhage, which affected the rest of his life.
"There was no neurosurgeon in Cameroon," says Georges Well.
If we had the money, we would take our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, Wells continued to visit his father at highly crowded clinics and hospitals and receive whatever treatment he could get.
"It's not easy," Well said.
You leave home at 5 in the morning with the expectation that you will be the first person to arrive at the hospital, but that doesn’t happen.
There are a lot of patients there.
Some people can wait until death.
The situation has not changed much since Well's father's death in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people in Cameroon.
If compared, there is one physician for every 413 individuals in the United States.
And even if there are doctors, many residents of Cameroon cannot afford it.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly two-thirds of healthcare expenditure in the country is in the private sector.
“Their only problem is poverty,” says Well.
And being poor, they cannot enjoy their lives.
Seeing the pain of his father and his countrymen, Well resolved to resolve some of it.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers conducted 700 free surgeries last year.
He also became a physician himself, and worked as a vasculature surgeon at Yonde's Central Hospital.
And they launched the non-profit organization Escovium, which goes to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped about 32,000 people.
On almost every Friday, they and about 30 people sit in a van, tie medical supplies to the roof and go to rural areas where people need medical attention.
Sometimes luck is not with them.
They have to push the vehicle more than once by pushing through the rivers and the soil.
But when they arrive, they really get the honor of heroes: feasts, singing and dancing, and the best accommodations the community can offer.
Free medical care in these villages is indeed a reason to celebrate, and well – with its great smile and endless energy – involves joy and happiness.
The next morning his team begins to meet hundreds of patients.
“We’re meeting 500 people each trip,” Well said.
They come from about 60 km away from the village, and they come on foot.
All these weekend clinics offer a variety of medical services.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may be able to get vasakhi, donated glasses or free birth certificates -- this document is required in school, but many poor families cannot afford it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgery with local anesthesia.
Operations are usually carried out in school buildings, town halls, or at home; after the procedure, the patient moves on to the recovery area, making room for the next person.
The group's generator lights up the operating room and sanitizing equipment, and Well and his volunteers work on Sunday mornings.
It's a rugged pace, but village musicians generally help keep the team motivated.
“They play drums all night long to keep us awake and continue our work,” Well said.
On Sunday, his team returns to the city, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
The group, which includes doctors from Cameroon and foreign medical students, has done 700 free surgeries last year, and knows their help can change the world of the people they help.
One person reported that he would be able to return to work due to receiving free hernia surgery.
The man said, "This will change the future of me and my family."
In addition to running a weekend clinic and working as a hospital surgeon, Well also works at a private medical clinic around the compound at night.
He pointed out that this is his second job that finances 60% of his non-profit work; the rest is funded by private donations.
"I don't know when they sleep," said Katy O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer at Well's group.
They are always either in the hospital, or trying to make money for their organization, so that they keep running these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley who come from the United States and Europe to join Well's campaign, this is an experimental opportunity they can never get in their country.
“We have been able to gain experimental experience in the surgical we help Dr. Well catch tools or clean blood stains,” O’Malley said.
As a second-year medical student in the U.S., you will never have the opportunity to do so.
Volunteer students typically spend on their own to arrive in Cameroon, and they often come with medical supplies of donations.
But after reaching the compounds, they come and go, and the costs of the instructions are well - borne.
"There's no doubt they're heroes," says O'Malley.
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameroon is never going to end.
For Well, almost the same workload, there is no difficulty.
Helping other people live a happy life, fulfilling the promise made to their father, these are the things that give them a lot of joy.
"I'm very happy when I do this," Well says.
And I think about my father.
I hope they see what I am doing.
I'm doing this to make people laugh, reduce their pain.

Manmohan Singh is the Prime Minister and his government is, yet he needs an answer from Modi.

Obama's health care bill has been withdrawn.
Amid a shower of criticism, President Obama retracted his frequently repeated misleading promise yesterday that "you can continue to do so if you like your health plan."
With millions of people receiving revocation information from their providers, Republicans have criticized the president for misleading U.S. citizens in recent times.
Yesterday, Obama changed his real message.
He said in a speech in Boston that “a lot of people who have health insurance, and that’s useful, can continue to do so.”
Addressing what he calls a "flag of news" about the repeal, Obama has graced U.S. citizens receiving these information to buy new coverage in the market.
Most people will be able to get a better deal, as much money or even cheaper than the proposed comprehensive health care plan.
"You'll get a better deal," he said.
It should come as no surprise that 5 per cent of the population who buy insurance with their own money may be forced to change their plans as their coverage is not in line with the desired standards under the Affordable Care Act.
In a statement before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington, Sebelius said, "I tell these American citizens directly, you deserve better than that."
Sebelius, who is taking responsibility for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online market since October has been "unfortunate."
"I'm just as disappointed and angry as everyone else," he said.
I want to gain your trust again.
Sebelius, from a fellow sitting behind him at the House hearing yesterday after a fierce nod with the Republicans, said the sentence in anger, which was caught by a mic. Billy Long, R-Mo about whether he would need to be nominated to Obamacare.
In a more than three-hour-long hearing, Long repeatedly asked Sebelius why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act, has not voluntarily renounced government-sponsored insurance to buy a plan through Healthcare.gov, which he is now selling to millions of Americans.

A proposal in this regard has been sent to the government by the ADA, which is going to be approved soon.
In this historic city, surrounded by Ganga-Yamuna on three sides, there is no longer a plot on which the ADA can plan a major housing project.

In an unexpected confession, John Kerry said U.S. espionage has "unfairly gone too far"
John Kerry has signaled a softening of the U.S.'s protective attitude on its surveillance program by unexpectedly acknowledging that sometimes its spying goes "unfairly far ahead."
The minister of state has also admitted that he is also guilty along with Barack Obama in the case of being on an "automatic pilot" as a rebel disclosure to informant Edward Snowden about the NSA's espionage activities unfolded.
This revelation has brought the U.S. government into diplomatic ground in relation to its allies.
Speaking via video link at the Free Government Conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “There is no question that the President, me and others in the government were really aware of some of the things going on with the automatic pilot, because looking back, it had the potential of World War II, and the difficult years of the Cold War, and then, of course, 9/11.”
They have become the first high-class member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage has crossed its limits, but insist that no one’s rights were abused.
He said: "In some cases, it's inappropriately gone too far."
And the President is determined to try to make it clear to the people and is currently conducting a thorough review so that no one is subjected to abuse.
I assure you that there is nothing wrong with innocent people in this process.
Mr. Kerry emphasized that, however, the NSA was striving for good cause, and its monitoring work has saved many lives.
He further stated: “We are facing a world where people are willing to blow themselves up.”
There is radical extremism in the world, which is committed to killing people and attacking governments.
So what's the problem if you're able to stop it before it happens?
We’ve actually saved the plane from collapses, buildings being demolished, and people being killed because we’ve been able to learn about the plans of others in advance.
Meanwhile, the chair of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday that U.S. lawmakers would go to Europe to help address concerns abroad about so-called U.S. espionage, and try to convince European countries about the need to continue anti-corruption efforts jointly with the U.S.
Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about threats to stop his involvement in terrorist organizations because of the National Security Agency's oversight loophole.
"It's really important for the US national security interests that European countries be with us in the context of our counter-terrorism efforts,"" Murphy, who was first elected to the Democratic Party and chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, told Washington in an interview."
European countries need to make it clear that we need to continue working together to fight terrorism, which should not be affected by their anger about the NSA program.
The news of the NSA recording millions of phone conversations in Europe has brought bitterness in relations with some of the U.S. allies, although the agency's chief said these reports were not entirely accurate, and reflected the misunderstanding of the metadata shared by NATO allies with the United Nations.
Other disclosures in documents leaked by Snowden suggest that the NSA has monitored cellphones of 34 other top world leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
National Director of Intelligence James Clapper defended the incident of spying on allies as necessary and said it was common practice by both sides to do so.
Amid the uproar, Murphy said his office was arranging a Congress visit that is likely to take place this year, and he hoped the delegation would include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of other law-makers participating will be released in the coming days.
He said that the work on the travel programme is still going on.

A new policy for board changes has been introduced in the municipalities.
Recently, a party of Congress leadership's board councillors in Saithia municipality of Virbhum district was changed to the Trinamool's board.
The change came as most of the Congress councillors, including the municipal chairman, joined the Trinamool.
Not only the Congress, but also some councillors of CPI, CPI and Forward Bloc have put the Trinamool under pressure here.
Trinamool Congress general secretary Mukul Roy said it was a good sign for the party.
He said 10 Congress councillors, including Sanithia municipality chairman Virendra Parikh and Congress leader Viplav Dutta, joined the Trinamool.
Some Left-wing councillors, including the CPI(M), have also hoisted the Trinamool flag.
All have written to the District Magistrate under the Bengal Municipal Act stating that they have become a part of the Trinamool and according to the number force, the Santhia Municipal Board has also come under the control of the Trinamool.
Mr Rai also claims that everyone agrees with the roadmap for Bengal's development under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.
Leaders of other parties, including the Congress, CPI, CPI, and Forward Bloc, are moving to join the Trinamool Congress.
Qualified leaders of any party are welcome to the Trinamool.
The Trinamool's capture of the municipal board is being seen as crucial in political circles due to the change of Congress councillors in the Saithiya municipality ahead of the November 22 municipal elections.
Earlier, Left-ruled Haldia and Nadia are also examples of TMC taking over the Congress-ruled municipal board.
Those who join the party are given a grand welcome at the Trinamool Bhavan in Kolkata when the party is in power in the district due to change of party.
Trinamool Congress general secretary Mukul Roy is excited about the leaders joining the Trinamool by breaking away from other parties.
He said those who break up from any party are welcome to the Trinamool.
He claimed that the faith of the people under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is increasing as a result of which people want to join the Trinamool.
However, the main opposition CPI(M) says lower-level leaders of other parties are being intimidated and intimidated.
People are joining the Trinamool Congress in fear of terror.
The CPI(M) is treating the change in the board of elected local bodies as a blow to democracy.
In a democratic manner, any party has the right to increase its population, but it is necessary to question the rationale for changing the vote on the issue of power.
Australian woman pleads against Thai prison term
A 21-year-old Sydney woman has been sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for making false allegations of assault on a taxi driver, appealing against the decision and getting bail.
On June 15, the Phuket provincial court found Stevie Rochelle Bomford guilty of making a false charge against the Thai police, alleging that a local taxi driver, along with two other individuals, tried to stop him on Sunday, June 10.
But later CCTV footage revealed that she had returned to the hotel safely after her separation from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police, after questioning Bamfort for two days, admitted to making up the story.
He was lodged in the local police station before the court.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison at a low-security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket, instead of an adult women's prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who has requested the Foreign Affairs Department in Canberra to assist her daughter.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about her daughter's care and wanted her back to Australia.
“It’s certainly been a worrying time for us, but we hope she’ll be back home as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamfod has appealed against the punishment order, and has been granted bail on 50,000 Baht.
Meanwhile, in Australia, the report said that she was vacationing in southern Thailand on a crabby holiday.
Thailand-based legal sources said Bamford's case was being contested by a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that as a result of the appeal, the court could extend his sentence to two years and force him to remain in adult prison.
However, after the recent killing of Australian travel agent Michael Smith in Phuket, Thailand can also be blamed for trying to improve its poor tourist image.
