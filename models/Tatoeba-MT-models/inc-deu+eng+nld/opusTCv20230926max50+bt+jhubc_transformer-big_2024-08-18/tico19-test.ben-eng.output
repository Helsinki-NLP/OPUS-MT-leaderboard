Rapid increase in cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The segregated cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) show a similar trend between the European Union/European Economic Area countries and the UK that ensures that although at different stages depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
Based on the knowledge gained from Italy, the country, hospitals and intensive care units need to ramp up preparedness for the rapid growth of COVID-19 patients who will need healthcare and especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a shocking pneumonia case was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, China's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the novel coronavirus as a functional component is now being referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Therefore, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection was named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
To date, the authentic data is that 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild disease, that is, respiratory tract infections with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 becomes a more serious disease that creates the need for hospitalization, while 6% of cases experience severe illness that requires intensive care.
The death rate of hospitalised patients due to COVID-19 is around 4%.
In this survey, we are reviewing the trends in each European Union/European Economic Regional (EU/EEA) country and UK (UK) COVID-19 cases and comparing them to Hubei province of China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with the number of Italys between January 31 and March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
China's backward COVID-19 spread more geographically and the mobility of the COVID-19 pandemic to the rest of the world is currently followed by this country.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
In the number of Eurosurveillance 2020, on March 5, Spiteri and his colleagues reported on the first European confirmed COVID-19 cases as per the WHO's case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on January 24, 2020 in Wuhan, China's Hubei province.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 was detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in the UK, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported as of 31 December 2019, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Recovered number of COVID-19 cases and cumulative extent found
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) only reports to the countries' health ministries, national and regional health authorities, and the WHO on the number of COVID-19 cases calculated in each country worldwide derived from official sources, which are updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
This data was used to assess the trend of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare what happened in Italy.
As a proxy for the outbreak of the active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the 14-day short-term incremental incidence of COVID-19, thus considering the natural course of COVID-19 during the period January 1 - March 15, 2020 in each EU/EEA country and the UK.
We have also presented the cumulative number of registered cases of each country up to 8 a.m. on 15th March 2020 and it is compared to the cases in Italy for the period 31st January to 15th March 2020.
COVID-19 Trends in the EU/EEA Countries and the UK
Trends in the 14-day short-term incremental incidence of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and in the UK generally followed the trend of Hubei Province (China) in general (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around February 21 and then increased sharply (complementary material) around February 28, 2020.
It was driven primarily by a rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK have shown a similar growth trend in the gradual increase in cases of COVID-19 growth (complementary materials).
Figure 2 shows a comparison of Italy’s numbers with the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK for the period 31 January–15 March 2020.
As of 8 a.m. on March 15, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK have already reported a comparable total of cases in Italy in just three weeks or less.
Our results indicate that the number of known cases of COVID-19 is growing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trend noticed in the sequenced cases of COVID-19 indicates that the pandemic is moving at a comparative pace in all countries.
Despite the fact that countries are at different stages, there are variations of national public health responses, and countries probably have different definitions of cases and different protocols for selecting patients that must be tested for COVID-19, including catch-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in Italy's infected areas described a situation where 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care, and media sources said hospitals and intensive care units in these areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
The admission data for COVID-19 patients in hospitals and/or an intensive care unit is currently only available in 6% and 1% cases at the EU/EEA stage, respectively (the data is not shown).
However, they should be systematically collected to supplement the current surveillance information that focuses on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010–11 in the format of 4.2 beds per 100,000 population in Germany from 29.2 to Portugal showed a major difference in the availability of Intensive Care and Intermediate Care beds in Europe.
This means countries may have fewer or more resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 people in 2010–11).
With the number of COVID-19 cases hospitalized in each EU/EEA country and the UK, modelling scenarios regarding healthcare capacity saturation have shown that there is a <0x3E>90% risk of intensive care beds being overburdened and provided in the ECDC's sixth update to the rapid risk assessment of COVID-19.
Since the incidents have so far been in the EU/EEA countries and some areas of the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units typically provide a specific regional service to the user population, data on infected and intensive care beds are recommended to be made available in the method of naming the regional unit for the figure 2 (NUTS-2) level.
Experiences from Italy and current trends from other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is making rapid progress in the EU/EEA and the UK.
So the ongoing community of SARS-CoV-2 in the country, hospitals and intensive care units should prepare themselves for the situation of infection and the need for healthcare and especially intensive care, as happened in the affected areas of Italy, to increase the number of COVID-19 cases.
As indicated in the recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, a rapid, pre-operative and holistic approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with changes in the path of mitigation from suppression, since the expected rapid increase in the number of cases, if not implemented before the deadline, may not give sufficient time to the adopters and hospitals to understand, accept and respond to those needs.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a brief period of opportunity that countries have the potential to further increase their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on healthcare.
If it fails to do so, there is a possibility that healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries will face an increase in the number of patients requiring intensive care in the next few days or weeks.
More than 3,000 people have died and more than 80,000 people have been infected in China and the rest of the world due to the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2, which has brought a catastrophe to mankind.
Similar to the SARS-CoV virus that caused SARS among thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also be transmitted from bats and cause the same symptoms through the same procedure.
However, the severity and mortality of COVID-19 is lower than that of SARS, but it is much more infectious and attacks older men and women than younger men.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications on emerging diseases, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the topic of rapidly developing research.
We will include primary topics about epidemiology of the disease, autism, virology, diagnosis, treatment, speed indicators of the disease, and prevention.
Although many questions still need answers, we hope that this review will help to understand and eliminate the dreaded disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory to all Chinese people who have been asked to stay indoors for the entire time of the holiday and yet for many weeks due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly correlated with the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and its associated disease was named COVID-19.
The pandemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread to more than 50 countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, there have been more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 due to the virus, of which more than 40,000 patients have been discharged and more than 3,000 patients have died.
"WHO warns that COVID-19 is ""the number one enemy of the people"" and possibly more powerful than terrorism."
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), less than two months after the first report on January 7, 2020, more than 200 articles have been published on COVID-19, including viruses, epidemiology, autism, diagnosis and treatment that determine the sequence of the virus isolated from multiple patients.
This review attempts to summarize the progress of research in new and fast-growing topics.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another CoV-caused disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, the pandemic in 2012).
What we have learned so far about disease prevention and forecasting and some of the remaining but urgent questions we have discussed.
CoVs are traditionally thought to be pathogens that are not life-threatening in humans, causing about 15% of the common cold.
Of course, in this century, we have faced twice the high-resolution sterilized human CoV, which is SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which started a pandemic outbreak in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and which soon spread to many other countries with terrible symptoms and mortality.
COVID-19 is the third COVID-19 outbreak recorded in human history.
As shown in Figure 1,1, the origins of pneumonia clusters were first reported from Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the China National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the COV sequence was released.
The first fatal incident in Wuhan was reported on January 15, 2020.
Meanwhile, the pandemic quickly spread to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, health care providers were informed about the infection, which indicated that it was possible to transmit the infection from people to people.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was locked down and all public transport was shut down.
The first clinical study on the disease on January 24 stated that only 21 of the 41 confirmed patients had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, considered the place of the onset of infection from unknown animal sources.
On January 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
By the time of this report, the disease has already spread to about 50 other countries in China and around the world (Figure 2.2).
As the situation rapidly expands, the final magnitude and intensity of the outbreak are yet to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-centric survey on 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented a more updated picture of the pandemic (https://mp.weixin.qqq.com/s/UlBi-H<0x58><0x5F>rHP<0x58>a1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 has infected people of all ages, but has mainly been seen in the 30-65 age group.
About half (47.7%) of those infected were over the age of 50, very few were under the age of 20, and only 14 were under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
The spread of COVID-19 has been mainly in Hubei and its surrounding areas.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from the onset of the disease to the diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from the onset of the disease to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The initial reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased rapidly before January 23, 2020, in line with the period of mass transportation before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate in confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the cumulative mortality rate among all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subset of large and folded viruses containing a single source of sense RNA.
They can be divided into four categories or genera, that is, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alpha- and beta-coV-poses are known to infect humans.
The wrapper for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (S) glycoprotein binds to its cellular customer angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptideal peptide 4 (DPP4), respectively, and then the membrane adhesion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after the transcription of the viral genome, the envelops form the genomeic RNA virion-containing vasculature with glycoproteins and nucleocaped proteins, which then merges with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic case of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 is the epicentre of the outbreak, a new type of beta-CoV with more than 99.98% of the 10 sequenced samples collected from Wuhan's Hunan marine food market.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically similar to SARS-CoV-2.
Through the electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the superficial part of the epithelium of the human respiratory tract.
It was reported that human ACE2 was a receptor in the case of SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S proteins in SARS-CoV-2 are relatively weakly bound to human ACE2 compared to SARS-CoV, which, in real terms, causes less severe infections in SARS-CoV-2 patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 is a novelly small protein encoded by orf3b and can also produce proteins encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2's orf3b may play a role in the ability to cause viral diseases and inhibit the release of IFN<0xCE><0xB2>; however, orf8 does not have any known functional fields or patterns.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou and others reported the cryo-EM structure of human ACE2 at a full-length 2.9<0xC3><0x85> resolution in mixed material, including the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the mixed material with open and closed adaptations was combined as a dimer, and the ACE2-B0AT1 alloy material could bind to two S proteins, providing evidence for the recognition and transmission of CoV.
In order to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection, B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target for clinical trials.
Original and intermediate wearer
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and spread to humans through civets and camels, respectively.
By comparing SARS-CoV-2 to other CoVs, bats were considered to be the natural hosts of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% equivalent to two SARS-like CoVs derived from bats called bat-SL-CoVZ<0x58>45 and bat-SL-CoVZ<0x58>21.
However, what intermediate host virus helped to overcome species barriers to infect humans is still unknown and the path to infection is yet to be explained in detail.
Ji and others who presented the snake as the carrier of the virus from bats to humans that are involved in homologous recombination in S proteins.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, indicated that the long-horned pangolin, often used in traditional Chinese medicine, is a potential intermediate for SARS-CoV-2 among mammals—the SARS-CoV-2 and the CoV discovered between the pangolins, 99% of which are genetic homology-based.
However, the 1% difference in the spread of the two genomes is still a big difference; therefore the conclusive results are still awaited for absolutely convincing evidence (Figure.33).
The psychochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet widely known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive up to 5 days in a dry environment outside the organism at temperatures below 20 <0xC2><0xB0>C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and at 56 <0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes in heat; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents other than chlorhexidine can make the virus ineffective.
The entire human race, in general, lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and therefore has a risk of being infected with the novel virus.
There are currently no detailed studies on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
So, we can only see previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
Usually, after a virus has entered the host, it is first identified by the host's innate immune system through the receptors of a pattern marker. These receptors include C-type receptors such as Lectin, TLR-like receptors (TLR), and NOD-like receptors.
Through various pathways, the virus induces the manifestation of inflammatory things, the maturation of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the transmission of the virus and accelerate macrophages phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help protect the virus from immune response.
Soon, useful immune responses also joined the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B> T cells, play an important role in prevention.
CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8<0x2B> T cells kill virus-infected cells directly.
T-helper cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help the immune cells.
However, CoV can inhibit the action of T cells by inducing the death of T cells.
The immune system, including supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential for fighting viral infections.
For example, antibodies isolated from recovered patients prevent MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, excessive sensitivity of the immune system creates a large number of free radicals locally that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst case scenario, multi-angle defects can even cause death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by the onset of jaundice, is more likely to cause harm to the elderly and pregnant women with pre-existing conditions.
It is common that people who have come in contact with a large number of viruses or those whose immunity is weak are more likely to be infected than others.
The estimated incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days, based on the study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, studies on 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period of the disease was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
According to a recent study, based on the population of 8,866 infected patients, the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
Adjusting the effective quarantine period based on the most accurate pathogen detection period is very important for health authorities, thus preventing transmission of the virus from infected but symptomatic people to others.
As a general rule, people infected or exposed to the virus usually need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Is it necessary to extend the quarantine period up to 24 days?
In most cases, fever is the main and primary symptom of COVID-19, with no symptoms, or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, drowsiness, headache, throat pain, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
A week after the onset of the disease, some patients felt dyspnea (respiratory) and/or hypoxemia.
In severe cases, patients develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and chocopathy.
In patients with fever and/or shortness of breath and severe fever, even if there are no pulmonary imaging abnormalities, the virus needs to be tested in early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December 2019 found that 98% of the percentage of symptoms had fever, 76% had dry cough, 55% had dyspnea, and 3% had diarrhea; 8% needed ventilation support.
Two recent studies of a class shaker (family cluster) and a shaker (cluster) caused by infection from an uninfected person were reported to have made similar discoveries.
In comparison, a demographic study in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%) as the main symptoms.
However, 80% of them needed ventilation support, which is much higher than COVID-19 patients and is consistent with higher mortality of MERS than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it was proved that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13%) were the main symptoms and that about 14%-20% of patients needed ventilation support.
As of February 14, the global COVID-19 death rate was 2%, while the confirmed cases reached 66,576.
In comparison, SARS had a mortality rate as of November 2002, with 8,096 confirmed cases being 10%.
For MERS, the death rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases based on a demographic survey in June 2012.
A previous study reported that 95% of SARS-CoV-2's R0 of 5.71-7.23 was higher than 6.47, including the Confidence Interval (CI), with the R0 of SARS-CoV only ranging from 2 to 4.
A comparison of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV with SARS-CoV-2 in terms of symptoms, mortality rate and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The numbers above indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infections are more likely to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but are less deadly than the other two.
Therefore, controlling the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is more challenging than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pandemic.
Infectious diseases often begin in the same family or from vehicles such as the same gathering or ocean ships.
Often patients have a history of traveling or living in Wuhan or other infected places or coming into contact with infected persons or patients in the past two weeks.
However, reports have found that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks, and patients who have recovered from the hospital can carry the virus again, sending a warning to extend the quarantine period.
In the early stages, the number of white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in patients is normal or low.
For example, in 1,099 COVID-19 patients, the number of white blood cells including the number of lymphocytes <0x3C>1<0xC3><0x97>109/L has reached <0x3C>4<0xC3><0x97>109/L in violphores and the level of elevated asperate aminotransferase and viremia was found in the <0x3C>9<0xE2><0x80><0xB2><0xE2><0x80><0xB2><0xE2><0x80><0xB2><0xE2><0x80><0xB2><0xE2><0x80><0xB2> of the lymphocytes in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Some patients had increased levels of liver and muscle fungus and myoglobin in their blood, and most patients had an increase in the concentration of C-reactive protein and erythrocytes in their blood.
In patients with severe cases, the level of D-dimer, which is a fibrin corrosive product present in the blood, increased and the number of lymphocytes decreased.
Chest radiography abnormalities are found in most COVID-19 patients and are characterized by bidirectional uneven shadows or blurred glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients are often seen with symptomatic pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory illness syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid respiration, and progressive fibrosis seriously endangers gas exchange.
The abnormal action of type-I and type-II pneumocytes reduces the surfactant levels and increases the surface-tightness, thereby reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and increases the risk of weakening the lungs.
Therefore, the worst types of chest radiological investigations are often seen in cases of the most severe extent of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, a pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed multinucleated sinus cells in the lungs of the deceased with pneumococytosis dissociation, haylin membrane formation, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration and the disease, which is similar to the viral infection and the pathology of the AARDS.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA identification was used as the main criterion for COVID-19 diagnosis through reverse-transcreptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
However, due to the extremely high wrong-negative rate, which could accelerate the pandemic, starting on February 13, 2020, in China, clinical or clinical manifestations began to be used for pathogens (which are no longer solely dependent on RT-PCR).
The same situation has been observed in the diagnosis of SARS disease.
Therefore, the connection between the history of the disease, clinical display, laboratory tests and radiological investigations is essential and necessary for determining the effective disease.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang Group described a protocol using the CRISPR-based Sherlock (SHERLOCK) technique to determine SARS-CoV-2, which used dipsticks in less than an hour without the need for expanded materials. Rated 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10 <0xC3><0x97> 10 <0xC3><0x97> 10 <0xC3><0x97> 10 <0xC3><0x97> 10 <0xC3><0x97> 10 <0xC3><0x97> 10 <0xC3><0x97> 10 <0xE2><0x97> 10 <0xE2><0x97> <0xE2><0x97> <0xE2><0x97> <0xE2><0x97> <0xE2><0x97> <0xE2><0x97> 10 <0xE2><0x97> <0xE2><0x97> <0xE2><0x97> <0xE2><0x97> <0xE2><0x97> <0xE2><0x97> <0xE2><0x97> <0xE2><0x88><0x97> 10 <0xE2><0x97> <0xE2><0x97> <0xE2><0x97> 10 <0xE2><0x97> <0xE2><0x97> <0xE2><0x97> <0xE2><0x97> <0xE2><0x97> <0xE2><0x97> <0xE2><0x97>
It is expected that the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and usefulness if clinical samples are verified.
Due to the lack of experience with Novel CoV, doctors can provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients, mainly as they try to treat other co-occurring diseases such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other virus-related diseases (Saturn (Sunny 2).
This therapy includes antiviral drugs, immune response suppression, steroids, plasma in patients who have recovered, Chinese medicine and psychological support for current and potential treatments.
It was also suggested to use plasma from patients who had recovered for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing to produce antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs at the beginning and also possibly attacks other organs at low levels that reveal ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
Still, respiratory inactivity and disability are the main threats and the leading cause of death in patients.
Thus, breathing support is essential for relieving symptoms and saves lives, and this includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, ventilation that does not need to be cut, and mechanical ventilation that has to be cut down depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), which is an advanced cardiopulmonary bypass technology, used to treat life-threatening cardiac or respiratory disorders.
It is also essential to maintain the balance of electrolytes in SARS-CoV-2 patients, prevent and treat indirect infections and septic shocks, and protect the functioning of vital organs.
It has been reported that excessive response to the immune system in SARS and MERS patients results in a cytokine catastrophe.
Cytokine is a form of inflammatory response to the cytokine present through the release of classes of cytokine, including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines emit a large number of free radicals through immune cells, which are the main cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Resistance resistance suppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine disorders, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and Tosilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine disaster.
Repressive treatments for other immune responses to cytokine disasters include correction of T-cell-directed immune response; inhibiting IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1, and TNF; JAK mitigation; suppressor of cytokine signaling 4; and HDAC mitigation.
To reduce the severity of inflammatory damage, steroids were widely used as immunosuppressants in the treatment of SARS.
Although high-dose steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injuries in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, dramatically affecting the possibility of healing.
Nevertheless, short courses of corticosteroids at low to moderate doses are advised to be used prudently for critically ill COVID-19 patients.
No effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed as of the time of writing.
However, the interstitial application of Remdesivir, including nucleotide analogues, has proven to be effective for a U.S. patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug, which was initially developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by the Ebola and Merlburg viruses.
Later, other single sources, including MERS and SARS viruses, showed potential resistance to the RNA virus as well.
Based on this, Gleiad has provided this compound to China for conducting a pair of trials on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly awaited.
Baricitinb, interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin are recommended as possible therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
After combined therapy with Lopinavir/Retonavir, diarrhea, vomiting, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur.
The interactions of this treatment with other drugs used in patients need to be carefully monitored.
Production of plasma and antibodies from recovered patients
Blood collection from patients who have recovered from infectious diseases has a long history to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy people from the clutches of the disease.
In fact, patients who have recovered often have relatively high levels of antibodies in terms of pathogens in their blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight against germs and other external objects, and they detect individual molecules of pathogens and directly mitigate them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, and with it decreased inflammation and viral loads and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, certain therapies have not yet been developed and prior verification and clarification is necessary to propose methods for widespread use.
Also, in terms of medical effects, some of the disadvantages associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can overestimate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and there is a huge demand for plasma to treat critically ill patients.
It is difficult to develop and develop antibodies at a specific stage in the fight against the global pandemic.
Thus, it is more important and effective to isolate B cells from patients who have recovered and to detect genetic codes to monitor effective antibodies against the necessary proteins of the virus or to encode effective antibodies.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years for the treatment of various diseases.
However, its effects largely depend on the combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis based on TCM-theory.
Most of the effective ingredients are unknown or unclear, as it is difficult to extract and verify the optimal combination of such ingredients or them.
Currently, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms, or for patients returning from severe stages, due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19.
For example, it was reported that Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
In many states of China, where TCM has been used for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, where 87% of patients have had the highest recovery rate, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningjia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while in Hubei province, where TCM was used for only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, the recovery rate was the lowest (13%).
However, this is quite a gross comparison because many other influencer factors such as the number and severity of patients should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing the combined treatment of WM and TCM with the treatment of Western Medicine (WM).
They found that the time required for body temperature to return to normal, relieve symptoms and hospitalization was significantly lower in the WM<0x2B>TCM group than in the WM group alone.
Most interestingly, the short-term decline rate (severe to severe) was significantly lower than the WM team only (7.4% vs. 46.2%) in the WM<0x2B>TCM team and the mortality rate was lower than the WM team alone (8.8% vs. 39%).
Despite this, the effectiveness and safety of TCM are awaited in larger doses and in more and more centres for more controlled testing.
It will also be interesting to identify the process of work and, if possible, clarify the effective ingredients of TCM treatment or their combinations.
Most patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are highly contagious and even susceptible to life-threatening diseases, and people in quarantine also experience monotony, loneliness, and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, cough and adverse effects of treatment such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to further anxiety and stress.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, various types of psychotic symptoms were reported, including long-term depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor exposure, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidal tendencies.
As part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, mandatory contact tracing and quarantine can create more anxiety and guilt about the impact of people being infected, quarantined and stigmatized by their families and friends.
So, COVID-19 patients, suspected individuals and individuals who have come in contact with them as well as the general public who need mental health care should also be provided.
Psychological support should include establishing mental health teams from multiple branches of medical science, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the outbreak and medical planning of SARS-CoV-2, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are necessary to prevent the chain of transmission of infectious diseases from animal reservoirs and infected people, and often they complement antiviral treatments to control the epidemic caused by exposed viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines to create long-term and robust immune antibodies against SARS-CoV and/or to create protective immunity.
Live-attenuated vaccines have been tested in animal models of SARS.
However, before starting a medical study, the effectiveness of these vaccines in older people and in the life-threatening-challenging model, and their protection against virus transmission from animal sources to humans, have not yet been determined.
This is probably because SARS was eradicated 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
In contrast, scattered events and MERS swarms continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the existence of zoonotic sources in the diseased region.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed using inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
Preparing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for people who are not immune is an urgent and important task to control the ongoing pandemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome this difficulty due to the need for a long time (average 18 months) for the development of the vaccine and the dynamic change of the CoV-groups.
As a novel disease, the entire clinical course of COVID-19 has just begun to fully develop for thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover slowly without prior illness.
But similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with much higher illness and mortality rates in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, it is imperative for health-service agencies, especially in areas with limited resources, to create a paradigm model of the disease to prioritize their services.
Based on the clinical study so far reported, the following factors may have an effect on or be associated with the speed indicator of the disease in COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the outcome of SARS disease, which is also true for COVID-19.
In a survey of 8,866 patients described above, 47.7% of those who were over 50 had COVID-19, mainly in the age group of 30-65 years.
Patients who needed intensive care were at the same time more likely to have other conditions and complications and were significantly older than others (the median age of 66 versus the median age of 51 years) which indicated age as a speed indicator of the disease for COVID-19 patient outcomes.
Gender: Men have more SARS-CoV-2 infections than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.
The existence and complexity of multiple diseases: Patients with COVID-19, who require intensive care, are more likely to suffer severe heart attacks and arrhythmias.
Cardiac events were also the leading cause of death for SARS patients.
It has also been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also be associated with ACE2-positive cholangiosite, which can result in defective liver function in COVID-19 patients.
It should be remembered that age and underlying disease are strongly related and can interfere with each other.
Unusual information found in the laboratory: C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the blood reflect the severity of inflammation or injury to tissues, and have been suggested as a potential disease speed indicator for disease, therapy response, and final healing.
It was also suggested to have a mutual relationship with the severity and predictability of COVID-19 with the CRP level.
Also, raised lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatinine kinase (CK) can also help predict outcomes.
These enzymes are widely released in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during cell damage.
Thus, they are routine markers for heart or liver dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: Timely advances in chest radiography and clinical symptoms should be considered together with other problems to predict the complexity and consequences of COVID-19.
The use of steroids: As described above, to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage, steroids are the commonly used immunosuppressants as an accessory treatment for infectious diseases.
Since high doses of corticosteroids were widely used in severe SARS patients, many of the respondents were suffering from avascular osteonecrosis, including long-term disability and low standard of living.
So if necessary, steroids should be used in the case of COVID-19 patients at low doses and for short periods.
Mental Stress: As described above, many patients during the COVID-19 pandemic often suffered from long-term quarantine and extreme uncertainty and were under unusual stress when they saw patients, including close family members and others, die.
It is essential to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help these patients get rid of stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 seem to be different from those of SARS.
In addition to transcription in the lower extremities of the respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively replicate on the upper extremities of the respiratory tract and does not cause mild symptoms or any symptoms in the early stages of infection, similar to other coVs responsible for the common cold.
Thus, patients who are at an early stage or during the development of pathogens can produce a large number of viruses during daily work hours, causing a lot of difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, if patients became seriously ill, SARS-CoV infection was thought to occur, when most infections did not occur in the early stages.
In this way, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more acute and difficult to control than the outbreak of SARS.
China is currently making great efforts, including a lockdown in Wuhan and nearby cities in the hope of preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the continued quarantine of almost the entire population.
While these measures have caused dramatic damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is declining, indicating the slowing of the pandemic.
The most promising estimate is that the disease outbreak will end by March, and the disease's downward phase will last for 3-4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter and others speculated that COVID-19, which is proving to be more contagious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and others set up a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic and indicated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both mid-turbinate and throat ulcers in patients who recovered and left the hospital two weeks ago, indicating that the newly identified virus would become a cyclical phase similar to influenza.
However, there are optimistic indications in China based on the falling number of new cases, indicating that current strategies may continue to work.
It was initially predicted that Ebola would cause one million cases, including half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease is finally under control.
It is also possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can weaken in cases of infection and eventually destroy or become a relatively less infectious virus in coexistence with humans.
The comparison between SARS and MERS with the COVID-19 pandemic is given below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is also highly transmissible through direct contact with cough or sneezing and possibly virus-contaminated components.
The virus was also found in feces, which highlighted new possibilities of infection from mallet-to-mouth.
A recent study on 138 cases found that 41% of the cases were probably caused by a nosocomial (hospital-derived) infection, including 17 patients with other pre-existing diseases and 40 healthcare providers.
Thus, adequate precautions must be taken to protect people, especially health-care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even patients or those who are close to them.
Masks can be used as the first stage of defense to reduce the risk of infection; the use of surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (Series <0x23>1860s) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical face masks prevent small droplets of fluid from a potentially infected person from spreading through the air or getting stuck on the surface of the object, from which they could spread to others.
However, only N95 (Series <0x23>1860s) masks can protect against taking through small virone respiration such as 10 to 80 nm, only 5% of the virone is able to fully penetrate; SARS-CoV-2 is the size of SARS-CoV and both are about 85 nm.
Since particles can enter through even five surgical masks, healthcare providers who come in direct contact with patients must wear N95 (Series <0x23>1860s) masks.
In addition to masks for health care providers to further reduce contact with the virus, fit isolation gowns should be worn.
The virus can also infect people through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 although he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus probably entered his body through his inflammatory eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also wear transparent face coverings or goggles when working with patients.
In public cases in affected or potentially affected areas, everyone is advised to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more frequently than usual, try to stay indoors to quarantine themselves, and limit exposure to potentially infected people.
A distance of three feet is considered appropriate for a person to stay away from a patient.
These measures are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came as a new virus in the human world, China's high alert should have been based on the deep memory of the 2003 SARS outbreak due to its high resemblance to SARS-CoV, according to a January 7, 2020 report.
However, until January 19, 2020, the director of Wuhan's Center for Disease Control comforted the citizens by saying that the novel virus is less contagious and limited in human-to-human fertility and that there are no problems in preventing and controlling the disease.
This message significantly eased public panic, especially when the entire country was preparing for the spring festival and the important time to curb the disease in Wuhan to a minimum was wasted.
China's disease control agencies can take this rigorous education and make essential improvements in the future.
For example, these organizations need to be more careful when making (1) public announcements as each word will be considered by citizens and it can change their attitude and decision; (2) physicians or officials must be more sensitive and responsive to the undesirable information obtained from clinics, without waiting for formal reports; (3) to be more proactive in the early stages of testing and prevention of possible epidemics, rather than trying to comfort the public.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and has spread to more than 50 countries around the world at the time of writing this report.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and is also in the middle of symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has created a feeling like the return of SARS.
However, there are some noticeable differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are necessary to suppress the pandemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people and men more than women, and the severity and mortality rate is also higher for older people than younger people.
The death rate of SARS is higher than that of COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients also transmit the virus in symptomatic conditions, while SARS patients usually do so in severe illness, making it much more difficult to suppress COVID-19 infection than SARS.
This is partly explaining why SARS-CoV-2 has spread faster and more massively than SARS-CoV.
In some COVID-19 patients, regular RNA evaluations for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative.
On the other hand, patients who have recovered can again be positive for the virus.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Considering such rapid progress in research on COVID-19, a number of important issues remain to be addressed as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of the genetic homology between SARS-CoV-2 and two-bat SARS-Navy CoV has been found, we still can't conclude that SARS-CoV-2 came from bats.
Which animal was the intermediate species to transmit the virus from the original host, such as bats to humans?
Without knowing the answers to <0x23>1 and 2, we cannot effectively reduce the spread of the infection and the outbreak can return at any time.
Although molecular modelling and biochemical assessments have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how does the virus enter the respiratory cells accurately and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also inhibit ACE2-speaking cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to this question, we will not be able to get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the pandemic last?
How the virus is genetically transmitted to humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, death like SARS, or a re-emergence of the flu at some point in time?
This is essential, but it takes some time to find the answers to the above and many more questions.
But whatever the price it demands, we have no choice but to stop the pandemic as soon as possible and get our lives back to normal.
The origins of human coronavirus
Conversion and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronavirus (CoV) and its hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illnesses such as common colds.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks have shown the currency upside down to reveal how devastating and deadly HCoV infection can be.
The rise of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has brought CoVs back to the top of the discussion and surprised us by the high transmissibility and low immunodeficiency compared to our sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is an animal-borne disease and understanding of the zoonotic source of HCoV can help us.
Most of the HCoV has been derived from bats where they are less pathogenic.
Some HCoVs have also been identified as Aadhaar holders.
Animal husbandry has a direct impact on the prevention of human diseases.
Researching the exchange of CoV in animals can also give important insight into CoV disease in humans.
In this review, we give a brief overview of existing knowledge about the seven HCoVs, focusing on their discovery history as well as their animal sources and interlinked infections.
Importantly, we compare and compare different HCoVs from the point of view of virus evolution and genome reconnection.
In this context, the current COVID-19 pandemic was discussed.
In addition, the need for successful host change and the impact of the virus' evolution on the severity of the disease is also noted.
The coronavirus (CoV) belongs to the coronavirus family, which includes a group-covered, positive-sensitive, single-stranded RNA virus.
"These viruses, which sheltered the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobytes of RNA viruses, were called ""CoV"" because of crown-like conjunctivitis under the electron microscope."
Structurally, CoVs have an integral genome that belongs to the same organization.
About two-thirds of the genome has two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted to pp1a and pp1b receptor polypropylene (translation).
Polyproteins are further processed to produce 16 non-infrastructured proteins, which have been named nsp1<0x7E>16.
The rest of the genome contains ORF for structural proteins that include worms (S), wrappers (E), membranes (M) and nucleoproteins (N).
Some lineage-specific accessory proteins are also encoded by different lineages of CoVs.
Based on the differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV), with most of the beta-CoV genus having HCoV, and are divided into four genera (A, B, C, and D).
Ethnic evidence has shown that bats and rats serve as the genes source of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main bases of Gamma-CoV and Delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have continually exceeded interspecies barriers and emerged as some of the major human pathogens.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been identified.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Civir Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as common colds and/or diarrhea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and newly detected SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing acute respiratory distress symptoms (acute respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS) and acute low respiratory tract infections in relatively more patients with a higher likelihood of exposure outside the lungs.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was collected from nasal discharges in patients with common colds in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been collected through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, until the SARS outbreak, the concept was widely accepted that the transmission of HCoVs is generally harmless.
The SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating events in recent history, infecting 8,000 people and having a crude death rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) led to epidemics continuing on the Arabian Peninsula and spreading widely throughout the rest of the world.
The 2019 novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), which is subsequently named SARS-CoV-2, is the functional agent of the current pandemic 2019 (COVID-19) of the coronavirus disease, which has resulted in more than 3,120 deaths and more than 91,000 people infected as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm clock is ticking and the world needs to be prepared for the impending SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
Each of the seven HCoVs has animal sources from bats, rats or domesticated animals.
Multiple evidence supports the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats, where viruses appear to be well adapted and non-infectious but have great genetic variations.
The COVID-19 pandemic presents huge medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges to China and the world.
Natural history, driving force, and species-to-species-jumping provide a framework for exploring the animal source of HCoVs to understand the causes of the limitation.
It can guide or manage the search for the Aadhaar, intermediate and amplifier animal host(s) of SARS-CoV-2 with important factors involved in preventing future spillovers.
In this review, we present an overview of animal sources, inter-species infections, and pathogens of HCoVs.
In particular, we would like to point out this general context and discuss that the protective viruses of HCoV-groups are usually infectious in their natural Aadhaar shelters but are pathogenic after entering the body of the new host.
We also review the trends in the evolution of HCoV where the prevalence of infection often decreases with the increase of the disease.
The results of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak have also been discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Various CoV-contains were collected in various infected animals, including turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats and dogs, before the first collection of B814 of the HCoV-229E strain from the nasal discharge of patients with common colds.
In the past decade, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A summary of the history of the discovery of HCoV in chronological order (Table 1) will be informative and educational.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from the respiratory tract in patients with upper respiratory tract infections in 1966 and was subsequently adapted to grow in the line of WI-38 lung cells.
In patients infected with HCoV-229E, common cold symptoms, including headaches, sneezing, feeling sick and sore throat, were observed, and fever and cough were observed in 10<0x7E>20% of cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was collected from the organ culture and later from the recurrent growth of the virus in the brain of dairy rats.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to the symptoms caused by HCoV-229E, which cannot be symptomically isolated from other respiratory tract pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread worldwide and are mainly infected in winter climates during the temperate season.
Usually, the onset of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by an illness of about 2 weeks.
A study by human volunteers found that healthy people with HCoV-229E developed mild common colds.
In patients with only a few immunity restrictions, severe low respiratory tract infections were observed.
"SARS, also known as ""Atypical Pneumonia"", was the first love-documented HCoV pandemic in human history and its causative representative was SARS-CoV, the third HCoV."
The first case of SARS was found in late 2002 in Guangdong province of China.
The SARS pandemic has led to reports of 8,096 cases across many countries and continents, of which 774 have died.
In addition to the super-spreaders, it was estimated that each case could increase about two accessory cases, along with a 4 to 7-day incubation period and showing final signs of viral loads as they appear on the 10th day of illness.
In patients with SARS-CoV, initially muscle soreness, headache, fever, feeling uneasy and after a cold, shortness of breath, cough and shortness of breath are seen as delayed symptoms.
Lymphopenia, deformed liver function tests, and increased creatinine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
Damage to scattered alveolar, enlargement of subcellular cells and growth of macrophages were also observed in patients with SARS.
About 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation at a later time.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, multiple organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidneys, can be infected with serious cases, usually with cytokine disorders that can be especially fatal in patients with immune system disorder.
The virus was first collected from an open lung biopsy of a relative of an index patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, a lot of effort has been devoted to HCoV research.
In late 2004, HCoV-NL63 was collected from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands.
It was initially prevalent in young children, elderly and respiratoryally ill patients who had low immunity.
Common diseases caused by HCoV-NL63 in cornea, eye sores, fever and bronchiolitis.
Another independent study described the collection of the same virus from the nasal samples of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it is widespread worldwide.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 is the cause of about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and most of these occur in summer, spring, and early winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as Croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was collected from a 71-year-old man with pneumonia and bronchitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to group-derived pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with acute asthma disease.
HCoV-HKU1, similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, has been found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
All of these four group-derived HCoVs have been well adapted to humans and are generally less likely to be converted to cause high pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred due to unknown reasons, such as the rare occurrence of the highly harmful subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to be a severe infection of low-respiratory ducts in China.
Usually, when these HCoVs have the ability to effectively transmit and maintain themselves in humans, they become less harmful or even more contagious.
In 2012, MERS-CoV was first collected from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who suffered severe pneumonia and sedation failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the laboratory-confirmed cases originate from the Middle East, there have been reports of cases coming from outside, including a second phase spread in sometimes close contacts in various European countries and Tunisia.
In 2015, another second-stage outbreak was reported in South Korea where 186 confirmed cases were found.
Marked by progressive acute pneumonia, the clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also experienced acute renal dysfunction, which is unique to MERS in the disease caused by HCoV so far.
More than 30% of patients have symptoms of stomach diseases such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratories have confirmed that more than 34.4% of deaths have occurred, resulting in MERS-CoV being one of the most deadly viruses for the human body.
From mid-December 2019 to late-December 2019, classes of pneumonia patients were detected in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China, as the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was traditionally associated with the virus.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the ongoing outbreak of low respiratory infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a public health emergency of international concern and named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, with a fairly 3.4% mortality rate, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide.
Notably, the fatality rate for Hubei in China is 4.2%, on the other hand, 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, presented as fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Diarrhea can also be seen in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and acute respiratory distress syndromes can progress quickly.
Although 82% of high nucleotide sequences are very similar to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 due to homology, they cluster in different branches of the national tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is relatively less pathogenic but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Infected cases have been reported in SARS-CoV-2 and can play a role in spreading it rapidly around the world.
Comparing and comparing SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs reveals very interesting similarities and differences.
First of all, the course duration of the pathogen and HCoV disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 is followed by SARS-CoV and four HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63) in the community.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits features that are typically seen with non-specific, mild or even symptomless presentations during community-acquired HCoV-communications.
On the other hand, even a small fraction of the severe cases of COVID-19 are showing symptoms of SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 infection groups show interesting characteristic patterns of both acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection is at least as high as group-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the transmissibility in humans after the passage is reduced, as in the case of SARS-CoV-2, it is still to be verified.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples.
Future studies have yet to clarify whether SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role in cases like SARS-CoV in at least some circumstances.
It is of particular interest to show whether SARS-CoV-2, like community-acquired HCoVs, also exhibit seasonal dependence.
Nevertheless, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity, and sustainable spread after passage in humans, will have an impact on the final outcome of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.
All four groups of people with mild symptoms have been well-accepted with HCoV.
From another point of view, it may also be true that people have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both can be the responders of the ancient HCoV epidemic.
The HCoV-types that cause serious diseases in humans and the people who have developed serious HCoV diseases have been eliminated.
In order for this to happen, HCoVs will need to produce transcripts in people enough to accumulate adaptive manifestations that fight against the causes of shelter restrictions.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts, and the more people infected with it, the more likely it will be to fully adapt to humans.
If it is well adapted, it will be difficult for the human body to stop its transmission by quarantine or other measures of infection control.
Over the years, four group-derived CoVs have been circulating in the human population, and are causing common colds in patients with general immunity.
These animals do not need an Aadhaar card.
On the contrary, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been well adapted in humans, and these infections cannot be sustained in humans.
These are required to be maintained and spread out in the Junotic Aadhaars, and perhaps seek the opportunity to spread them to capable human targets through one or more intermediate and amplifier hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has properties that are similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs.
At least until now, it's as highly transmissible as the community-acquired HCoV.
However, it is more pathogenic than group-derived HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoVs or MERS-CoVs.
It will have to be seen whether it fully adapts to humans and whether any Aadhaar or intermediate animal continues to circulate in humans without a host.
Before we discuss the animal sources of HCoVs, we will benefit from discussing the definition and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, Aadhaar, intermediate, and amplifier hosts of HCoVs.
An animal acts as an evolutionary host of HCoV if it shelters the closest related ancestor by sharing superior homology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The paternal virus is usually well adapted to the body of this host and is non-infectious.
Similarly, an Aadhaar holder provides shelter to HCoVs in a continuous and long-term manner.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and are natural hosts of HCoV or its parent virus.
On the contrary, if HCoV is newly introduced to an intermediate host before or just around it, it does not fit well with the new host and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate host can act as an animal source of human infection and can play the role of an amplifier host in temporarily reversing the virus and then amplifying the level of human infection through infection in the human body.
If HCoV cannot continue the infection in the intermediate host, the infection can be prevented.
In contrast, HCoVs can also be adapted to the intermediate host and start a long-term prolapse.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural aadhaar host.
Data from epidemiology revealed that the SARS index had a history of animal contact with the event.
Next seroprevalence investigations have indicated that animal traders had more outbreaks of anti-SARS-CoV IgG than the general population.
A raccoon dog in the gandagokul (Paguma larvata) and live animal markets was first identified for carrying SARS-CoV-like viruses that were almost similar to SARS-CoV.
It was indirectly supported by the information that no other SARS cases were reported after the killing of all the odours in the markets.
However, it has been reported that the masked palm civets of wild or farms without exposure to the live animal market were largely negative for SARS CoV, which indicates that the masked palm smells will only act as intermediate amplifier shelters but not as a natural basis for SARS-CoV.
Notably, since 80% of the guangzhou market contains anti-SARS-CoV antibodies to different types of animals, the possibility that multiple species of small mammals may also act as intermediate amplifier hosts of SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out.
All of these are considered one-way hosts of SARS-CoV.
The subsequent discovery of the natural animal host of SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat CoV, named SARS-related Rhinolophas bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in the Chinese herbaceous bat, which is a closely related bat CoV.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other bats share 88-92% nucleotide sequences with SARS-CoV.
These studies have formed the basis for new ideas that bats shelter emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have been identified from bats, but none other than a designated WIV1 can be collected as a live virus.
Human angiotensin converter enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as a customer of SARS-CoV.
Bats, civets and human ACE2 were shown to be receptors for entry into the WIV1 cells derived from bat stool samples.
Curiously, the serums in patients with SARS who are recovering were able to disable WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, which share 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Although these two viruses have a high level of homology, it is generally believed that WIV1 SARS-CoV is not an immediate parental virus and bats are not an immediate support host of SARS-CoV.
Physiological analyses classify MERS-CoV as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5 into the same category.
The bat uses the same host receptor, Deeptidal Peptides 4 (DPP4), to enter the CoV-HKU4 and the MERS-CoV virus.
The RNA polymerase sequences of RNA-dependent MERS-CoV are phylogeneticly close to the beta-CoV variants identified from Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative bat CoV-HKU25 share only 87% of nucleotide sequence homology.
Therefore, bats may not be an immediate Aadhaar donor of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have found that one hummingbird camel is Seropositive for MERS-CoV specific mitigating antibodies, just like middle-east-source camels in multiple African countries.
Similar to the virus found in humans, the residual MERS-CoV was collected from the nose swab of a hummus camel, which further indicates that the camel serves as the actual base host of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that camels that are tested by MERS-CoV usually have mild symptoms, although there have been a lot of virus shingles (virus shedding) seen.
Notably, infected camels spread the virus not only through the respiratory system, but also through the anus-oral pathways, which is also the main way to spread the virus from bats.
However, questions remain as many confirmed cases of MERS had no history of contact with camels before symptoms began, possibly of human-to-human transmission or of an unknown animal species that sheltered MERS-CoV.
The bat CoV RaTG13 collected from the Rhinolophas Afinis bat has a 96.2% similarity to the nucleotide homology of SARS-CoV-2.
In the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is also too high to determine the parent relationship.
This means that if almost identical bats are not found in the future, bats may not be the direct aadhaar host (s) of SARS-CoV-2.
Perhaps, the animal shelter between SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild animals sold and killed in the Huanan Seafood wholesale market, with whom many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were related, indicating a possible animal-to-human transmission incident.
A number of recent studies, based on metagenomic sequencing, have suggested that a team of endangered small mammals known as Banrui (Manis Javanica) may also carry the genetic beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
This novel is a replica of the 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology SARS-CoV-2 of the Bonnui CoV genomes.
However, with about 90% uniformity at the level of nucleotide sequence, they are evenly associated with RATG13.
They bind to two sub-genres of the virus, such as SARS-CoV-2, on the ethnic tree, one of which shares a similar receptor binding domain (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2 introducing 97.4% amino acid sequences.
On the contrary, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are further deformed, although the sequence homology genome-wide is of a higher degree.
A previous study on the diseased forestry also reported the detection of a continuous sequence of viruses from lung samples, which have been found to be similar to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted various assembly methods and manual presentations to create a partial genome sequence with about 86.3% of the full-length viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support direct forestry sources of SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequence separation between SARS-CoV-2 and the botanical SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV-sectors.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even lower than that of the beta-CoV-combinations related to SARS-CoV-2 and Banarui SARS-CoV-2.
The path of evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins, and other mammals has not yet been established.
Although the highest sequence homology between SARS-CoV-2 and Banerui's RBDs has been found, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV-combinations, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the most genome-adapted sequence homology.
It is highly far-sighted that the high similarity between the beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 associated with the RBD of the Banrui SARS-CoV-2 is driven by selectively-mediated trajectory evolution.
A counter-proposal is in favor of a recombination between the wild SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13, one of the third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, reconnections between beta-CoV-communities are widespread.
The exact origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown.
In addition to high pathogenic HCoVs, animal sources of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Physiological evidence indicates that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E were derived from bat CoVs, although parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in mice.
A bat known as ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV), detected in North America with HCoV-NL63, showed a close relationship.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to CoV, another bat called Hipposideros/Ghanacovam/19/2008, although comelyids have also been suspected as its intermediate host.
For clarity, animal sources of known HCoV-groups are summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Ethnic analysis has provided evidence of the inter-species incidence of CoVs in history.
In the 1890s, when HCoV-OC 43 species crossed and infected humans from domesticated animals, a respiratory epidemic was observed.
The history of inter-species transmission of HCoV-229E is relatively less clear.
Alpha-CoVs of bats closely related to HCoV-229E have been found.
One of them is the Alpaca-Alpha CoV.
Several evidences support the transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, the shared ecological environment can be from contact with bats to humans but not with alpacas.
Instead, people have close contact with the alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E-related bats are diverse and non-infectious in alpha-CoV-communicable in bats, while alpaca alpha-CoV causes respiratory diseases in infected animals.
Alpaca alpha-CoV was not found in wild animals.
Thus, the possibility that alpacas get alpha-CoV related to HCoV-229E from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including the rabies virus, the Ebola virus, the Nipah virus and the Hendra virus.
So it's not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
On the other hand, bats act as a gene pool of alpha-CoV-229E, but alpacas and one-horned camels can serve as intermediate shelters that transmit the virus to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as a great example of spreading an interspecies infection from bats to bats and from a hummingbird camel to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known in early detection, and this is further reinforced by subsequent studies.
It is clear that bats provide a rich base of virus species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, spontaneously full colonization, close social exchanges, and strong flying skills are favorable conditions for bats to become the ideal 'virus spreader'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV came into contact with a bald camel a few decades ago.
It fits well with these camels that have become a stable and natural Aadhaar shelter from an intermediate shelter.
MERS-CoV causes very mild diseases and maintains a relatively low incidence rate among these animals.
Its spread among humans is an accident and people remain the last shelter of MERS-CoV because its infection cannot be sustained.
Unlike the role of camels in transmission of MERS-CoV, it is different if pangolin is present in SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoV-containing is extremely pathogenic among pangolins.
They may be the last shelter for SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs similar to snorkeling in the case of SARS-CoV.
Various possibilities of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from inter-species animals to humans may have to be included or canceled in future studies.
First, bats can be the base host of a SARS-CoV-2 related virus that is almost similar to SARS-CoV-2.
People can share environmental niches with bats through slaughter or coal mining.
Secondly, forestry can be one of the intermediate amplifier shelters where a SARS-CoV-2 related virus was newly introduced.
People are infected with the virus by cutting and eating prey meat.
It is possible that many mammals, including domesticated animals, are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.
A study of domesticated and wild animals for antibodies has been confirmed.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in third species that have contact with both bats and pangolins.
The origins of SARS-CoV-2 are still being investigated.
In addition to the different types of animal shelters, the three main reasons for the viral side are also important in helping CoVs to overcome interspecies barriers.
First, they have a relatively high mutation rate in the form of RNA.
"Compared to other single-stranded (stranded) RNA viruses, the estimated emission rate of CoVs can be considered ""high"" to ""medium"" depending on the rate of COV adaptation of the novel host, and the average replacement rate <0x7E>10-4 replacement will be 2 per site per year."
CoV-contains a proof-reading exoribonuclease, the elimination of which results in excessive variability and weakness or even a survival disability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analog remdesivir is known to form CoV replicas by emitting exornibonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most likely anti-SARS-CoV-2 ingredients tested in clinical trials.
Yet, the rate of COV-counting is about one million times higher than their host country.
In addition, the conversion rate is often higher when CoV-containers can't cope well with the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with SARS-CoV, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently low, which is an indication of more easily adapting to humans.
It is likely that it has already been adapted to another shelter nearby.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, it also applies to MERS-CoV, which suits well with a ribbed camel.
Theoretically, there is very little chance that the genetic drift vaccine and antivirals of SARS-CoV-2 will quickly become ineffective.
Secondly, the large RNA genome of CoV uses extra flexibility in the genome for recombination and recombination, which increases the likelihood of evolution, including interlinking, which is convenient for the emergence of CoV-groups when the situation becomes more convenient.
It is supported by a lot of unique encoded open reading frames and protein functions at the 3<0xE2><0x80><0xB2> end of the genome.
"Third, CoV-containers randomly and often change templates when copying RNA through a unique ""copy-like"" process."
In a shelter that acts as a mixture pot, strand switching often occurs during the CoV RNA transcription.
Higher homogeneous full-length and subgenre RNAs can reconnect to create new CoVs.
The phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination is found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 and in animal coV-containers such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Reciprocal action of the virus-related infection
In addition to the three viral ingredients mentioned above, the viral exchange with the host receptor is another key factor influencing interspecies transmission.
Among these, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as an ideal example, which also showed evidence of positive selection when interspecies transmission occurs.
Based on a comparative analysis of the collection of human and odourous SARS-CoV-CoVs, SARS-CoV is thought to be able to adapt quickly to the RBD mutation of S proteins, especially among different hosts.
Usually in the S protein of a CoV interacts with the RBD cellular receptor and is sharply selected by the response of the host antibodies.
In SARS-CoV, the RBD is contained in the S1 piece in the 318th to 510th amino acids that bind to human ACE2 as well as its correceptors for viral entry.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is able to recognize ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bats, civets, rats, and raccoons, which can cause interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, only the residues of 6 amino acids have been found to be different from those of odourgolic viral isolates in humans and RBD, and 4 of them are located in customer-bonded design to interact with the ACE2 customer.
Civet SARS-CoV RBD contains K479N and S487T mutations, which can increase the ability of spike protein to interact with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, the replacement of these two amino acids can be serious for virus-related adaptations in humans.
It is important to note that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are similar to cellulite.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV's S1 unit of protein indicates that human ACE2 may change the trend of bonding with its S proteins.
In fact, a cryo-EM study indicates a 10 to 20 times higher bonding trend than the trend in human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It is also important to determine if another co-applicant may be needed for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The HCoV-NL63 is also tied to ACE2 but with a different part of S.
There are many other HCoV customers, such as aminopotadiase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetyltide silicic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They can also be counted as the reason for the successful adaptation of these CoVs in humans after they have been infected from their animal shelters to the intra-species.
In addition to cell receptors, the results of interspecies transmission of HCoVs are also governed by factors of dependence and limitations on other hosts.
The division of these host proteins between human and HCoV-containers such as bats, one-winged camels, and rats can be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoVs will have to take over the host dependency factors for a successful interspecies infection and destroy the host constraint factors.
In this case, the molecular determinants are yet to be identified and characterised in this important case of virus-responsive exchanges.
An unbiased genome-wide screening of host dependencies and restrictions for SARS-CoV-2 using state-of-the-art technology of CRISPR can be fruitful.
The Rise of the Novel HCoV: Back to Where It Started
The diversity of bat CoVs provides ample opportunities for the emergence of novel HCoVs.
In this sense, bat cov-samples act as the gene pool of HCoV-communities.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombination drive HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the novel protein-coding genes have the ability to radically modify the acquired or lost viral phenotypes.
Among the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 has been found to be important in adapting to humans because there were collections of SARS-CoV-related bat viruses but they have been found to encode discrete ORF8 proteins.
A 29-nucleotide removal feature of SARS-CoV-poses has been found in strains collected at the beginning of the human pandemic.
This removal divides the ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and it seems to be an adaptive mutation that stimulates the change of shelter.
Also, there is a history of possible recombination of SARS-CoV with alpha- and gamma-CoV-groups, where a large number of small recombinant regions were identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombination positions were also marked on parts of nsp9, most nsp10 and nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the epidemic MERS-CoV went through the process of reconnecting between different tribes, which happened in the case of a bald camel in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, other HCoVs have also been noted for recombination cases, where HCoV recombinates with other animal CoVs in genes that do not form them.
It should also be cautioned that artificial selection may contribute to unintended changes in the viral genome, possibly as a result of the release of viruses from election pressures such as the host immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype formula due to the removal of two-nucleotides.
Although intact ORF4 can be seen in bats and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, the alpha-CoV shows a single nucleotide placed inside, resulting in the frameshift.
Last but not least, the evolution of the novel HCoVs is also driven by election pressures.
When the bats were infected with CoV, they were symptomless or they were only detected with mild symptoms, indicating a mutual adaptation between CoV-types and bats.
It has been found that bats adapt well to co-occurring and physiologically co-exist.
For example, the defects in the activation of the reaction to inflammation in bats effectively reduce the pathology driven by CoV-communities.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats has been suppressed due to the low release levels of repressive natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and the main histococompatibility complex I class molecules.
Moreover, suppressing the reproduction of high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) CoV generated from high metabolic activity in bats and affecting proofreading by exorbitant bacteria can do both of these, thus providing the selection pressure needed to produce the strains of the virus when exposed to a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains can also be developed through recombination that leads to the acquisition of new protein or protein character for host adaptation.
Thus, the possibility of the emergence of three new HCoVs over the past two decades is not coincidental.
CoVs cause mild symptoms in non-infectious or their Aadhaar shelters, such as bats and camels.
They grow strongly without the strong resistance of the shelter.
There is a secret to why symptomatic carriers are seen and what causes serious cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to excessive activation of the immune response and cytokine storm where the stronger the immune response, the more intense the lung damage.
In contrast, in the case of symptomatic carriers, the resistance response is separated from the CoV replica.
The same technique of disconnecting the immune response may have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon reaction is particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, the application of type I interferon should be beneficial at least in the first stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, NLRP3 inflammatory activation in bats is faulty.
With this logic, the prevention of NLRP3 inflammatory disease, including MCC950, can be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the common factors that led to the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
On the one hand, a bat beta-CoV has been found that transmits 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, while there is a bat-CoV that transmits 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although odours and other animals found in the market have been reported to have sheltered similar viruses to SARS-CoV, immediate intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Oddly related to SARS-CoV-2 have been found to be the Banrui beta-CoV-composites, indicating that Banrui will act as one of the intermediate shelters or that the Banrui beta-CoV-composites may contribute to the gene fragment in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although the questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is either intentionally or accidentally man-made.
Due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, CoVs have once again returned to the center of discussion.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals significantly changed our perception of the importance of animal sources and animal Aadhaars in human transmission.
Extensive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have a bat source and are transmitted to humans through intermediary shelters.
As the SARS-CoV infection stems from contact between humans and odours in the market, shutting down the wet market and killing odours there could effectively put an end to the SARS epidemic.
Through the same logic, pangolin should be removed from the wet markets to prevent animal infections in view of the discovery of multiple clusters of pangolin beta-CoV-communities closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, future investigations into what exactly and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through bonrooi and other mammals are yet to be made clear.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in one husky camel for a long time.
These camels serve as the main source of meat, milk, leather and fur for the local people in addition to an important means of transportation.
They are spread across the Middle East and Africa.
So it is impossible to sacrifice all camels for MERS control, as was done in China's wild animal market to prevent SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent repeated outbreaks of MERS, an all-encompassing approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels in combination with other infection control mechanisms.
As we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may appear to be spreading.
There are many types of CoVs in nature.
In particular, bat CoVs with animal potential are very rare.
These Junotic CoVs have a lot of potential to grow and reconnect, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that will be more transmissible and/or fatal in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the testing of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, there should be a plan for better preparation and response.
Many viruses have existed in the world for a long time.
They live in their own natural habitat until they have the opportunity to spread.
Although bats have many features that are conducive to the spread of the virus, the chance of humans being exposed to bats and other wildlife species can be minimized if people are made aware to stay away from them.
To better understand the ecosystems of CoV-countries and their natural host ecosystems, it is necessary to constantly monitor mammals, which will prove effective in preventing human infection and future outbreaks from animals.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent animal-borne diseases in humans is to stay away from the environmental niche of the natural base of the animal virus.
Several pieces of animal source puzzles of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats infect the parental virus of SARS-CoV-2 in the wild, it is necessary to see under what circumstances bats and monkeys can share the same environmental niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in human infection, then how humans come into contact with bats should be determined.
Thirdly, if a third mammal acts as an actual intermediate host, it must clarify how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domesticated animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental transmission should be performed.
Whether it's bats, pangolins or any other mammal, it's expected that SARS-CoV-2 or almost identical strains of the virus will be identified in its natural hosts in the future.
The ongoing investigations in this case will explain the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have a significant impact on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the criteria that determine the "infected" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19.
On 6 February 2020, our team published a quick advice guide for the detection and treatment of the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) infection, and this guideline provided us with experience and made good references to the fight against the pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, based on ongoing research findings and clinical practice experiences, our awareness and knowledge is also gradually increasing; therefore, diagnostics and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidance and provided a new diagnostic criteria for the "suspected case" and "confirmed case" in accordance with the latest COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment guidelines issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) spread, which has been officially named Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus has been named Civir Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO identified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a quick consultation guide and it was published online in military medical research on February 06, 2020.
Since its release, it has received a great response.
Keep in mind that COVID-19 is a new disease, based on ongoing research findings and clinical practice experiences, our awareness and knowledge are also gradually increasing; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), issued the COVID-19 Epidemic and Medical Guidelines (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, released a total of seven editions, each of which contains some significant changes to the content.
Now that Zhou and her colleagues have made a comment about our instruction, they have offered a simple score determination based on their clinical experience.
Their work has added new evidence to our guidance and has also created valuable references for the pandemic worldwide.
We appreciate their hard work and thank them for it.
However, COVID-19's most recent diagnosis and treatment guidelines (the seventh edition of the trial) and their work will also have to be updated in line with recent research.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), in order to confirm the suspected case, one of the epidemiological historical characteristics for a detailed analysis must have two clinical symptoms, or if there is no clear epidemiological history, then three clinical symptoms must be met.
Epidemiological history: (1) the history of the inhabitants of the city of Wuhan and its surrounding areas or the history of travel there, or other communities where the symptoms of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the arrival of the symptoms; (2) the history of the confirmed cases of the infected areas in the vicinity of the hospital in the last 14 days; (2) a history of contact with the infected cases of SARS-CoV-2; or a contact history of the infected patients prior to the nucleic acid test; (3) the city or the surrounding areas.
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with imaging characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) Total white blood cell counts show normal, reduced or decreased lymphocyte count at the stage of initial footing.
For a confirmed case diagnosis based on suspected cases, any one of the following should have a pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors come positive to the real-time anti-PCR test from the IVR <0xE2><0x89><0xA5>2 level of the IRS-CoV-2 inhibitor; (2) to the full gene sequencing of the virus, or to obtain high homogeneity or similarity with the novel coronavirus; (3) to the SARS-SARAM test
We have found that, in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) versions, real-time PCR tests and blood samples have been included in the respirator.
The pathological detection of blood samples was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (eight February 2020); and then the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the ongoing work of researchers that the samples of the respiratory tract, including blood samples, to search for a favorable nucleic acid detection kit for a quick diagnosis, which increases the availability of different samples and which helps to bring certain antibody positive results to sure standards.
Moreover, more and more evidence has been found, which reminds us to be wary of irregular symptomatic and symptomless patients.
Therefore, the flow list of Zhou and her partners should be updated, as they have classified people who do not have clinical symptoms as "low-risk."
The score system also needs to be verified in subsequent clinical practices and studies.
As a conclusion, we hope that more direct evidence will come and readers will call for their comments.
In order to diagnose "identified" and "confirmed cases," we recommend identifying them and following the most recent guidelines in our country.
Our team will update our guidance in a timely manner to help.
Bangladesh has reported the highest daily new deaths due to COVID-19.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 on that day.
This is the highest number of deaths due to the virus in a single day.
Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) said yesterday that the number of infected cases recorded included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases who were at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
IEDCR Director Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora said four men and one woman were involved in the death.
According to Dr. Mirzadi, two of the cases are over 60 years of age, two are between 51 and 60 years of age, and one is 41-50 years of age.
He also said that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11.
Jalal Saifur Rahman, a director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, was among the dead, a hospital official told local news agency Anadolu Agency.
In an online video announcement on Saturday, Bangladesh Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader said public transport will be closed for longer than initially planned until next Saturday.
The closure of public transport began on March 26 and was planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of essential goods such as medical, fuel and food was still allowed.
On March 8, the first case of COVID-19 infection was registered between two people returning to Italy in Bangladesh and one of them's wife.
As of March 19, all three have recovered.
The number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide has exceeded one million.
According to Johns Hopkins University, the total number of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 has surpassed one million worldwide.
At least 52,000 deaths were linked to the coronavirus-induced disease, COVID-19.
The important event happened on the same day that Malawi confirmed their first coronavirus infection and Zambia's first coronavirus-related death.
As of Thursday, North Korea had claimed that it was one of the few remaining countries free of the coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization has documented 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases, in the previous 24 hours at 10 a.m. (8800 UTC).
In the United States, more than 244,000 coronavirus cases were documented, linking at least 5,900 deaths.
Citing data from Johns Hopkins University, CBS News reported that more than 1,000 people in the United States have died from the coronavirus infection on Wednesday.
All over the world, countries have announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow's mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city's lockdown until May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin has announced that payments will continue to be made even if the Russians do not work until April 30.
Portugal's parliament voted in favor of extending the national emergency for 15 days; 215 votes in favour, ten votes in favour, and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia has extended the curfew in the holy city of Mecca and Medina for the whole day; the previous curfew was only effective from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand had planned to implement the curfew between 10 pm and 4 am.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine has announced that the state has extended its stay-at-home order until May 1.
In Australia, the number of toilets per transaction has been reduced.
On Sunday and Saturday evenings, Australia's store chain Olworths and Coles reduced the limit on buying toilet paper per transaction in all stores at the national level to two and one package, respectively.
Also, on Monday, ALDI launched a one-pack limit.
These restrictions were posted as messages in checkouts and on the chain's Facebook pages.
Consumers are said to have been stockpiling fear of COVID-19 by thinking that people have to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also made a pack per order, limiting the sale of toilet paper for home delivery.
These changes followed the limitations of the four packs of previous transactions that Woolworths and Coles launched on March 4th and 5th respectively.
"On March 8, Coles media reported that the four-packet ban had been introduced in various places, but ""in some stores still sold out within an hour of delivery"", describing the demand as ""unprecedented"", and in a Facebook post on ALDI on Tuesday they described it as ""unexpected""."
According to a spokesperson for Woolworths, sales have increased sharply over the past week.
Last week, a two-pack grocery store in Canberra was also allowed for two packs.
To reduce the deficit further, Coles orders larger packages from suppliers and increases the supply repetition rate, Woolworths orders additional stocks, where ALDI makes stock available in advance for a planned special Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers tried to increase stockpiles, but local council restrictions made it difficult during delivery by trucks.
As suppliers try to meet the demand, he expects the cost of production to increase.
Aldi announced on Tuesday that after leaving the stock earlier, some stores may not be able to handle Wednesday's special sales.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail sales expert from the University of Technology of Queensland, said that shops fill up their reserves every night.
He commented that toilet paper is a heavy material, resulting in very little collection of it, and when all is sold, the huge shelves are empty and the feeling of scarcity is reinforced.
"According to ABC News, ""Coles and Woolworths are of the opinion that if he has a lot of things, and things like toilet rolls and sanitizers [can be taken], and if they are large enough, that fear is likely to be reduced,"" said Russell Zimmerman."
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper, Hu Gibbs A Crap, said on Wednesday that their stock would run out.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures clean toilet tissue and solaris paper, insists that they are working 24/7 to maintain supply.
A real estate site Domain.com reported that some property sellers were offering free toilet paper to the first bidder at the auction in Melbourne, some of which were due to auctions that buyers had a long weekend off on Labor Day.
In this Thursday's publication of NT News, printed every day in Darwin, an eight-page adjunct is given to cut into pieces and used as toilet paper.
A report from ABC Australia on March 3 said the shops were largely reluctant to impose restrictions, where they said they had no plans to impose restrictions on their purchases.
Russell Zimmerman also said that the demand for other products is also very high, including masks, sanitizers, dry products, handwashes and flour.
In the same way, the sale of paper used for the Andres toilet in the online British supermarket Okado every Sunday evening outside of Australia is restricted to two 12-roll packs.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19—a disease caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2—a pandemic.
"While the term ""immune"" does not imply how dangerous certain cases are but refers to how widespread any disease has spread, the World Health Organization noted the need for governments to take action:"
"""All countries can still change the course of this global pandemic."
"WHO Secretary-General Adam Ghebreyesus said if states can identify, ""check, treat, isolate, identify, and organize""."
"""We are deeply concerned about both the alarming level of spread and severity and the alarming level of inactivity."""
"According to Dr. Tom Friedan, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, the global pandemic is ""unprecedented""."
"In a statement released to CNN in February, he said, ""Without influenza, no other respiratory virus has continuously tracked the spread of the virus in the world."""
"Gabresus also expressed the same view, saying, ""We have never seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus before."""
"He continued, ""And we've never seen a global pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."""
The new status obtained as a global pandemic follows the WHO's decision to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern in January.
"Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak, ""The situation is going to get worse."""
The Associated Press reported on Thursday that the number of COVID-19 infections worldwide is at least 126,000, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
This 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is a pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019, which was declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and was declared a global pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, about 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been detected in 210 countries and union territories, leading to nearly 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
Case fatality rate in China is estimated at 4%, while worldwide the range of this rate ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and Acute Respiratory Disorders Syndrome.
The time from exposure to symptoms to the onset of symptoms is usually five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering your face during coughing, maintaining distance from other people, and monitoring and keeping yourself isolated for people suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by shutting down travel controls, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk control and facilitation.
The global pandemic has led to severe global socioeconomic disruptions, cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and increased supply shortages as a result of fear.
Schools and universities are either nationally or locally closed across 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world's total student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been cases of alienation and discrimination against other individuals in Chinese, East and Southeast Asia, and others from areas where the virus has been found to be significant, depending on their race and appearance.
Due to the closure of travel and heavy industry, air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported on a cluster of pneumonia cases due to unknown causes on December 31, 2019, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were linked to the Huanan marine food wholesale market, so the virus is believed to have an animal source.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronavirus, Banerui coronavirus and SARS-CoV. The first person who was diagnosed with symptoms was reported to be sick, later on 1 December 2019 it was reported that he had no visible connection with the weight market cluster; and later on that person had no visible contact with the weight market cluster.
The market was linked to two-thirds of the initial cluster of cases in December 2019.
An unconfirmed report by the South China Morning Post on 13 March 2020 indicated that a case of origin found on 17 November 2019 may have been the first, which occurred in a 55-year-old man from Hubei province. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that new infections in China had sodomized, but the number of new cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea had increased abruptly, and the first number of new cases outside China was reported.
The number of cases may be less, especially in people with mild symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases have been reported among young people, most of them under the age of 19 and 2.4% worldwide. Patrick Vallance, chief scientific adviser to the United Kingdom, estimates that 60% of the British population needs to be infected before they gain immunity.
According to the official protocol, cases are the number of people who have tested positive for COVID-19.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, have formulated formal policies not to test only people with mild symptoms.
A study published on March 16 found that as of January 23, about 86% of COVID-19 infections in China had not been detected, and this undocumented infection was the source of 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy was significantly higher than the official count of infections.
The initial estimate of the general reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it was probably 5.7.
Most of the people have recovered from COVID-19.
For those who do not, the death interval is 6 to 41 days from the onset of symptoms, the most common of which is 14 days.
About 97,000 deaths were reported on April 10, 2020 related to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, 80% of people who were over 60 years of age and 75% of those who had pre-existing heart disease and diabetes had various diseases including heart disease and diabetes. Official figures for COVID-19 deaths usually indicate those who were infected with COVID according to traditional rules.
The death toll from COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include people who die without tests - such as at home, nursing homes, etc.
Some partial data from Italy found that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic has increased by 4-5 times the official COVID death rate.
"A spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States admitted ""We know that [the number of reported deaths] is lower than the actual number estimates"", a statement that was confirmed by a report not counting the number of deaths in the United States as of January 2020."
The first death outside mainland China occurred in the Philippines on February 1 and the first death outside Asia on February 14 in France.
As of February 28, more than a dozen deaths outside mainland China have been reported in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of 13 March, deaths have been reported in more than forty countries and territories on all continents of the world, except Antarctica. Several methods are used to determine the mortality rate.
These numbers vary by region, and the amount of testing, the quality of the healthcare system, the treatment options, the time cut since the initial outbreak, and the population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health. The ratio of death and infection shows the number of deaths within a given time limit divided by the number of cases that have been diagnosed.
Based on statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the proportion of deaths and cases worldwide is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, the ratio of mortality and case fatality rates has dropped from 17.3% (who have shown symptoms between January 1-10 of 2020) to 0.7% (who have seen the first signs since February 1 of 2020). Among other preventative measures, the percentage of deaths (CFR) falls to those who have died from the disease, reflecting the percentage of deaths (in the case of individuals who have died from the disease) and the infection.
These figures are not limited at any time and follow a specific population from infection through case analysis.
Many scholars have attempted to calculate these numbers for a specific population.
The Oxford University Center of Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the overall mortality rate for the pandemic in this infection is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The calculation above this range is consistent with a statistical study of the first allopathic test of COVID-19 in Germany and the test's impact on CFR estimates.
WHO has said that the pandemic can be controlled.
The maximum limit of the outbreak and the final deadline may vary depending on the location and uncertainty.
"Macize Bony of Penn State University said, ""As the virus goes from unexplored, infectious diseases usually dominate and then begin to erode when the disease no longer has a host."
At this point, it is almost impossible to predict when it will happen.
"Zhong Nanshan, a senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, argued that if all countries could be united to follow the World Health Organization's advice to prevent the spread of the virus, ""it could end by June""."
"On March 17, Adam Kuchersky of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 would ""probably continue to spread over a year or two."""
"According to research from Imperial College, led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures are required until a vaccine is available (perhaps 18 months or more).
"William Shefner of Vanderbilt University said, ""I think it's quite impossible that this coronavirus — as it gets infected so quickly — will disappear completely"" and that it could ""be turned into a seasonal disease, coming back every year""."
The severity of the return will depend on the animal's immunity and the extent of the immunization.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and people infected may be symptomless.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
The relatively less common symptoms include – fatigue, respiratory spleen production (cough), loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, pain in muscles and restless connections, sore throat, headaches, body getting cold, vomiting, coughing, coughing, diarrhea, or cyanosis. WHO has stated that about one in six people suffer from severe breathing difficulties.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States lists respiratory, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, wakefulness and blueness of the face or lips as urgent symptoms; it is recommended to seek medical help immediately if these symptoms are present. Further development of the disease can be due to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, and death.
Some of the infected may be asymptomatic without any clinical symptoms, but the test results confirm the infection, so the researchers have also issued advice to monitor and examine people who have come in contact with infected people who have been confirmed to avoid the infection.
The Chinese estimate of the symptomatic ratio ranges from a few to 44%.
The range of the stage of normal incubation (the period during which the infection and symptoms begin) is 14 days to 14 days; five days of practice. In the example of uncertainty, the fraction of people with COVID-19 who initially had a smell loss is accounted for 30% and those who subsequently had a lapse of 15%.
Some details on how the disease spreads are still being determined.
It is believed that the disease is mainly spread by small droplets generated during close contact and when coughing, sneezing or speaking; close contact means that it is between 1 and 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
The study found that from an open cough, the water can go from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
According to some, the virus can also be infected by small fluid droplets that can occur while speaking, which can last for a long time in the air. Breathing redness can also occur during exhalation, including when speaking, although the virus is not usually airborne.
Watermelon can enter the mouth or nose of those who are nearby or they can enter the lungs through inhalation.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can lead to respiratory ejection becoming aerosols and can result in airborne transmission.
It can also spread when someone touches any contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches their eyes, nose, or face.
Despite the concern that it can spread through the mall, this risk is considered low.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of oral infection from SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious within the first three days after symptoms appear, although it can be contagious before and after symptoms appear.
Many people have tested positive three days before the onset of these symptoms, suggesting that it is possible to transmit the disease before any significant symptoms appear.
There are only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed symptomatic cases, but some countries have detected symptomatic infections during contact tracing investigations.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, but one person usually infects two to three people. The virus survives on surfaces for several hours to days.
In particular, the virus is found in plastics for three days (polypropylene), 304 stainless steel, one day on cardboard and in copper for four hours.
This varies depending on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have been tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities recommend hand washing after contact with animals, just as the infected person has to do after touching other surfaces.
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel and novel virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a team with acute respiratory illness in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of Novel SARS-CoV-2 are found in all related coronaviruses found in nature. Outside the human body, this virus is killed by the soap in the room as it breaks down the protective shell of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to be the source of some animal-borne disease.
Genetic analysis has shown that the corona virus is genetically combined with strains found in two bats in the subgenus Serbecovirus (Line B) with the genus Betacoronavirus.
In other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13) the level of the complete genome is exactly 96%.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the genome sequence between the virus in the forestry and the virus in the human body.
Compared to the entire genome to today, it has been found that if there is too much of the coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, 92% of the genetic material is similar, which is insufficient to prove that Banru served as a host in the middle.
Infections can be diagnosed through the virus, depending on the symptoms temporarily, but ultimately confirms the reverse transmission polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) of the infected larvae.
A study comparing PCR with CT in Wuhan has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, and that many of the characteristics of taking pictures of it coincide with other pneumonia and disease processes.
"In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that ""CT should not be used as a first-line test for COVID-19 diagnosis""."
The WHO has released several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was issued on January 17.
The test uses reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) in real-time.
The test can be done on breathing or blood samples.
Results are usually seen in a few hours to a few days.
In general, this test is performed on top of a nasopharyngeal swab, but a throat swab may also be used. Several laboratories and companies are preparing serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these have been proven to be accurate enough to be approved for far-reaching use.
In the United States, serological tests made by chelex were allowed to be used only in emergency situations.
Characteristics of people with symptoms taking pictures in radiographs and computed tomography (CT) include asymmetric peripheral ground glass opacity and the absence of pliural fusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of images obtained from the test of confirmed cases.
For mixing with other infections like adenoviruses, PCR has restricted the formation of an image without any confirmation and identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the PCR with the CT results of the booklet and explained that, although imaging of the infection is now less specific, it is faster and more sensitive which suggests considering it as a screening device in the epidemiologically affected areas.
Artificial intelligence has been developed by the birth body, which prepares the characteristics of the virus through radiographs and CT.
The strategies to prevent the spread of the disease include maintaining overall personal good hygiene, washing hands, not touching eyes, nose or mouth with washing hands, and sneezing or coughing in tissues and putting the tissue in a garbage container.
Those who have already been infected have been advised to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent infection. Many governments have advised or regulated against all non-essential travel from countries and territories affected by the outbreak.
The virus has spread to large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading to the public, and some people in the community do not know where or how they were infected. It is recommended to use evidence alerts, contact alerts, and eye protection to care for anyone who may be infected. It is very important for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and find people who come in contact to prevent further infections.
The administration's use of mobile phone location information for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, and Amnesty International and more than 100 organizations issued a statement calling for limiting such surveillance.
Multiple mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert teams have been working on a preferred solution to privacy, such as the use of Bluetooth to log in to others' mobile phones.
Users will then get a message if they come in contact with a COVID-19 positive person. There are a number of misconceptions surrounding how to prevent the infection. For example, washing the inside of the nose and gargling with a mouthwash is not effective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, although many companies are working to create one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people occasionally wash their hands with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands will be apparently dirty; before meals; before the nose blows, when coughing, or when sneezing.
Because the virus can be killed with household soap outside the human body, which breaks the protective bubble of the virus.
The CDC recommends that when soap and water are not available to the hands, at least 60% alcohol-containing sanitizer can be used instead.
WHO has advised people not to touch their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be made pollution-free with a few solutions (within a minute of contact with the disinfectant on the surface of stainless steel), including 62–71% ethanol, 50–100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5% povidone.
Other solutions such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate are relatively less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed in places like office or day care, then the office, bathroom, common place, shared electronic equipment, such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote control and ATM machines used by sick people should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people fold their mouth and nose elbows during coughing or sneezing, or cover the tissue with paper and leave the tissue right away.
Those who are at risk of getting infected are advised to wear surgical masks. Wearing a mask can help control the amount of sneezing, sneezing or coughing, and the extent of the sneezing.
The WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to wear a mask.
"According to virologist Stephen Griffin from the University of Leeds, ""Masks can reduce the tendency to touch people's faces, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene""."
WHO advises healthy people to wear masks only if they are at high risk, such as those who are caring for a person with COVID-19, although they also acknowledge that wearing a mask can help people avoid touching their faces.
Some countries have started encouraging people to wear face masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing non-medical masks on the face made of cloth. China specifically recommends the use of disposable medical masks by healthy members of the public, especially when approaching other people (1 meter (3 feet) or less.
Hong Kong has recommended wearing a surgical mask while traveling in public transport or while staying in crowded places.
Thailand's health officials are encouraging people to make face masks at home and wash them daily.
Wearing a mask or covering of nose and mouth is prohibited when going out in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
On March 16, Vietnam urged everyone to wear a face mask when they went to crowded places to keep themselves and others safe.
The Austrian government has issued an order that every grocery store should wear a face mask when entering.
Israel has asked all its residents to wear masks whenever they go out.
Taiwan, which has been producing about a million masks per day since mid-March, requires passengers to wear face masks on trains and inter-state buses to travel on April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear masks whenever they go out, and has advised those who cannot afford to buy face masks, to wear homemade face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes reducing close contact between individuals and slowing the spread of the disease and controlling the spread of infection.
Methods include: being quarantined; limiting travel; closing schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shop-markets.
Individuals can apply social distancing methods by limiting travel from home, avoiding crowded areas, greeting without touching, and maintaining physical distance from each other.
Many governments are now making it mandatory or advising to maintain social distancing in areas affected by the outbreak of the disease.
According to U.S. government authorities and health institutions, the maximum size of the conjunctivitis is rapidly reduced from 250 people (unless known to have spread COVID-19 in the area) to 50 people and later to 10 people.
"On 22 March 2020, Germany banned gatherings of more than two people in public. By means of the treatment of older adults and people with underlying medical conditions such as physical distancing, heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure, and damaged disease prevention, the ""maintenance of distance"" by means of the interventions that allowed people to ""maintain contacts"" is an increased risk of serious illness and complications to the end of March, and the CDC has advised them to stay at home as much as possible."
"The use of the term ""social distancing"" has impacted in a way that has led to complete social isolation rather than encouraging people to keep in touch with others in alternative ways."
This includes only having sex with someone who lives with you who does not have the virus or has no symptoms.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for those infected with COVID-19 and those who suspect themselves to be infected.
Health agencies issue detailed guidelines for appropriate self-isolation. Many governments mandate or recommend self-quarantine for all residents living in the affected areas.
The strictest guidelines for self-quarantine have been issued for high-risk groups.
People who have come in contact with someone with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region with widespread infections have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible contact.
The strategies for controlling any outbreak are containment or suppression systems and mitigation.
In the early stages of the outbreak, suppression is arranged, and the goal is to detect and isolate infected people to prevent the spread of the disease among the remaining populations, as well as introduce and vaccinate other transmission control measures.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of the disease in any other way, efforts are made to reduce the level of mitigation: some remedies are taken to slow the spread and reduce its impact on the healthcare system and society.
At the same time, both content (containment) and mitigation (neighbourhood) may have to adopt a mixed standard.
More extreme measures need to be taken to reverse the pandemic cycle from the number of early breeding to less than 1. Reducing the maximum limit of the pandemic is part of tackling the outbreak of an infectious disease, known as the leveling of the pandemic curve.
It reduces the risk of health services by becoming absorbed and gives more time for vaccinations and treatments to improve.
Other ways that the outbreak can be controlled other than medicine include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing a face mask, and quarantineing yourself on the premises; making the outbreak more difficult, such as keeping the public out of sight after the physical distancing was observed in China, as well as the prevention of the outbreak and the suppression of public gatherings; such other ways are to acknowledge and participate in the clean-up; also environmental measures, such as surfaces.
Other countries have adopted a number of standards aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea launched mass trials and local quarantines, and issued a warning on the movement of infected people.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines on those who failed to do so.
Taiwan has increased the production of face masks and increased fines for medical supply fraud. A smattering of efforts from Great Britain and the United States demonstrates that mitigation (has been slowed but the pandemic has not stopped) and suppression (increase in response to the pandemic) is a major challenge.
While the principles of maximum work-life balance can reduce the maximum demand for health care by 2/3rds and half, the health systems are still in a state of disarray as a result of millions of deaths.
Suppressing may be the preferred way, but it is necessary to maintain it as long as the virus remains in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if it comes first), as measures are relaxed otherwise the virus infection will return quickly.
Long-term interventions to contain the pandemic lead to social and economic losses.
No specific antiviral drugs are approved for COVID-19, but efforts are underway to develop, including testing of existing drugs.
Over-the-counter cold-crushing medications, taking fluids and taking rest can relieve symptoms.
Depending on how serious the illness is, oxygen therapy, intravenous (through the veins) fluids and breathing support may be needed.
The use of steroids can lead to worse results.
Multiple compounds approved in the past for the treatment of other viral diseases are being researched for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO also stated that some "traditional and home remedies" help alleviate the symptoms that may be seen as a result of SARS-CoV-19.
Acquiring increased capacity and health centers for COVID-19 patients has been described by the WHO as a preventive measure to initially prevent the spread of the disease.
The ECDC and the WHO's European Regional Office for Hospitals and Primary Medical Supplies issued guidelines for multi-layered sources to be removed and include increasing the lab's focus on testing for COVID-19, increasing the number of intensive monitoring through isolation and isolation of COVID-19 positive patients and training staff, and the number of ventilators and beds available.
There are various theories as to where the first case (the so-called Patient Zero) may have originated.
The first case of the novel coronavirus was reported on December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei was gradually increasing.
Most of these were related to the Huanan marine food wholesale market, where even living animals were to be sold, and according to a theory the virus came from one such animal; or, in other words, it has an animal source. A pneumonia cluster of unknown causes was observed on December 26 and Dr. Zhang Jiaxian (Zhang Jixian) reported to Hubei Provencial Hospital on December 27, who treated Hubei C.
"On December 30, a team of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a ""SARS-like coronavirus""."
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wenliang, were reprimanded by police for spreading false rumors, and another doctor, I Feyn, was reprimanded by his high-ranking staff for expressing alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice on December 31 and informed the World Health Organization.
In early January, a number of cases of unknown pneumonia were reported in Wuhan, which is subject to investigation. At the initial stage of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-2020, the virus spread to other parts of China with the help of Chinese New Year migration and Wuhan being a transportation hub and major rail junction.
On January 20, China stated that about 140 new cases were detected in a day, including two from Beijing and one from Shenzhen.
Further official data showed that as of January 20, 2020, 6174 people had already had symptoms. As of March 26, the United States had seen the highest number of confirmed cases in the world, surpassing China and Italy. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 people have recovered.
There was at least one case of infection in about 200 countries and regions.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen region restrict free movement and impose border controls.
The national response includes some repressive measures such as segregation of everyone (known as a stay-at-home order or a stay-at-home order or lockdown) and curfews. As of April 2, about 300 million people or 90% of the population, some kind of lockdown in the United States, more than 50 million people in the Philippines, about 59 million people in South Africa and 1.3 billion people in India are under lockdown.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown, which increased to 2.6 billion two days later - about one-third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was detected in Wuhan on December 1, 2019, but according to an unconfirmed report, a case was first detected on November 17.
Dr Zheng Jijian noticed a cluster of pneumonia on December 26 for unknown reasons, after which his hospital informed the Wuhan <0x58>ianghan CDC on December 27.
The initial genetic testing of the patient's samples, which took place on December 27, 2019, indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notification.
They were informed on the same day.
"After these notifications were published, the police were warning of ""spreading rumours"" about the outbreak of Wuhan's doctors."
"The Chinese National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no ""clear evidence"" of transmission from people to people."
"In late January, the Chinese government launched a revolutionary campaign that was later described by Chinese Communist Party general secretary <0x58>i Jinping as a ""people's war"" to control the spread of the virus."
"A Cordon Sanitary was announced on January 23 by stopping to travel to and from Wuhan, described as ""the largest quarantine in human history"", which was expanded to a total of 15 cities in Hubei and affected about 57 million people."
Private vehicles are prohibited in the city.
The Chinese New Year (January 25) has been cancelled.
Officials also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, which was completed within 10 days.
After Leishenshan Hospital, another hospital was built to take care of additional patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China had converted 14 other centers in Wuhan, such as the Convention Center and the stadium, into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government took steps to take additional measures to prevent the COVID-19 outbreak, including the extension of the health declarations for tourists and the holiday of the spring festival.
Schools and universities across the country were also closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macau have taken various measures, especially in the field of schools and universities.
In many parts of China, arrangements were made to work remotely.
Hubei was subject to control over travel in and out of the country.
Public transport systems have been changed across China and museums have been temporarily closed.
"Controls on public movement were applied in many cities and it is estimated that about 760 million people (more than half the population) faced some outside restrictions. After the outbreak entered the global phase in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from being ""imported"" from other countries."
For example, all international travelers entering the city of Beijing declared it mandatory to stay in isolation for 14 days. Only one case was domestically infected on mainland China five days before March 23rd. It is found among a traveler returning from Istanbul to Guangzhou.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang announced that the spread of domestically-infected cases had been largely blocked and the outbreak had been controlled in China.
Two months after the lockdown was imposed, in addition to Wuhan, the control over travel to Hubei was relaxed on the same day. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on 26 March 2020 that entry permissions for people holding visas or residence clearances would be suspended from 28 March, and no specific details were given as to when the policy would end.
Those who wish to enter China must apply for a visa at the Chinese embassy or consulate.
The Chinese administration encouraged businesses and factories to reopen on March 30, and provided a financial stimulus package for companies. The State Council announced a day of mourning that began at 4 April at 10:00 a.m. with three minutes of nationwide silence, the day on which the Kingdom Festival was also held, although the central government asked families to pay online tributes while maintaining physical distancing to avoid the new outbreak of COVID-19.
On January 20, 2020, it was confirmed that COVID-19 had spread from China to South Korea.
The country's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, mainly due to the new religious movement in Daegu, known as the Shincheonji Church of Jews.
Visitors to the Shinchangji Church, which arrived from Wuhan to Daegu, were suspected to be the source of the outbreak.
Of the 9,336 followers of the church on 22 February, 1,261 reported symptoms, or about 13%. South Korea declared the highest level of alert on 23 February 2020.
More than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea on February 28, which increased to 3,150 on February 29.
All South Korean military bases were separated after three soldiers tested positive for the virus.
The airline's schedule was also affected and changed for that reason. South Korea launched a program to test people for the virus and isolate infected people and find and quarantine those they came into contact with, which is considered to be the world's largest and best organized program.
Screening methods include reporting symptoms of new international arrivals by the mobile app itself, driving through the virus, which results in the next day and the ability to test up to 20,000 people per day.
Programs in South Korea without the cities being fully quarantined have been considered a success in preventing the outbreak. South Korean society was first polarized in response to President Moon Jae-in in this crisis.
Many Koreans claim the outbreak has been officially abused and have signed a petition calling for Moon's impeachment or praising his response.
On March 23, South Korea reported the lowest number of one-day cases in a total of four weeks.
On March 29, it was announced that from April 1, all new arrivals from abroad will be quarantined for two weeks.
According to media reports on April 1, South Korea has accepted requests for virus testing from 121 different countries.

Iran has allocated 5 trillion riyals to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on February 26, 2020 that there were no plans to quarantine areas affected by the outbreak, and that only independents would be quarantined.
Plans to limit travel between different cities were announced in March, although heavy traffic between cities continued as the Parsi New Year was ahead of Noroze.
Shia religious places in Kom were open until 16 March 2020. In February, Iran became the epicentre of the spread of the virus after China.
In the midst of claims that the scale of the outbreak in Iran was slowing, more than ten countries found Iran as their source of infection by February 28, indicating that the magnitude of the outbreak was much higher than the 388 infections reported by the Iranian government until that date.
On March 3, 23 of the 290 members of Iran's parliament tested positive for the virus.
On March 12, the human rights watchdog appealed to Iranian prison officials to unconditionally release detained human rights abusers for peaceful dissent and to temporarily release all eligible prisoners.

The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for lifting economic sanctions on countries, including Iran, that have been the hardest hit by the pandemic.
The outbreak was reported to have spread to Italy on January 31, when two Chinese tourists in Rome tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
Cases began to rise even more sharply, prompting the Italian government to stop all flights arriving from China and declare a state of emergency in the country.
A bunch of unorganized COVID-19 cases were found after 16 confirmed cases were reported in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the cabinet issued a new law regarding the outbreak, where, in northern Italy, more than 50,000 people were separated from each other from 11 different municipalities.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "The outbreak has shown that there will be no entry and exit routes to places where there will be no entry and exit routes."
"Work has already been disrupted in those areas and sporting events have been suspended. ""On March 4, the Italian government ordered the closure of all schools and universities at the national level as Italy's death toll reached 100."

A CNN report indicates that the combination of Italy's large elderly population and the inability to test for the virus to date may be pushing the high mortality rate.
At first, the UK had the most relaxed response to the virus, and as of March 18, 2020, the British administration had not imposed any social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government has received a lot of criticism for not realizing the magnitude and importance of the impact of the disease on people. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that all unnecessary travel, social gatherings are prohibited and he advised everyone to work from home wherever possible and ordered pubs, restaurants and theaters to avoid.
On March 20, the government announced that all vacationing establishments such as Pub and Jim should close as soon as possible and pledged to pay up to <0xC2><0xA3>2,500 per month to 80% of workers to prevent unemployment during this crisis. On March 23, the Prime Minister announced strict social distancing measures, banning gatherings of more than two people, and limiting travel and outdoor activities to only those that would be essential.
Unlike previous measures, these controls were enforceable by the police, by issuing fines and removing gatherings.
"Most of the businesses, including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, petrol stations and garages, were ordered to be closed, only businesses considered ""essential"" were an exception."

Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, whose origins are in the United States or Italy, have denied an earlier confession about the first outbreak of the coronavirus in Wuhan.
"Donald Trump's administration described the coronavirus as a ""Chinese virus"" or "" Wuhan virus"", saying China's ""censorship has supercharged a virus that has now become a global pandemic"", which some critics have criticized in response as racism, and an attempt to ""disguise from its administration's failure to prevent this disease""."
"The Daily Beast received a speech about the United States government's actions that outlined a communication strategy with existing sources at the National Security Council, where the strategy was cited as ""everything China-related""."
"We are told to try to spread this message in any way possible, including through press conferences and television appearances. ""Outlets like Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that China's efforts to send aid to virus-affected countries are part of a campaign to spread global influence."
"Joseph Borrell, head of the European Union's foreign policy, warned that there was ""a geographical-political part including a struggle to make up stories and to exert influence through ""politics of generosity""."
"""China is aggressively pushing this message that unlike America, it is a responsible and reliable partner."""
China has repeatedly urged the United States to stop its donations to Syria, Venezuela and Iran, when it was reported that it was sending aid to the next two countries.
Jack Ma's 100,000 masks donated to Cuba were blocked by U.S. sanctions on April 3.
U.S. authorities have been accused of using the aid they have provided to other countries for their own country.
There was a dispute over masks between Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and other countries such as the Czech Republic and Italy.
Turkey also seized hundreds of ventilators for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized Italy for its lack of EU solidarity with the coronavirus-affected Italy.
Maurizio Masari, Italy's ambassador to the European Union, said: "Only China has responded bilaterally."
"This is certainly not a good sign for European solidarity."""
On March 22, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged for the Russian military to send military medics, special disinfectant cars and other medical equipment to Italy.
"The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous ""high-level political source"" as saying that 80 percent of Russian aid was ""irresponsible or hardly usable for Italy""."
"The source blamed Russia for downplaying a campaign to ""demonstrate geopolitically and diplomatically""."
Lombardi's President Attilao Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio rejected the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical supplies to the United States.
"Kremlin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, ""When it comes to helping American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when US medical equipment manufacturers get some momentum, they can also compensate."""
"NATO's ""Defender 2020"" military practice, planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, is the largest NATO combat practice since the end of the Cold War."
Kate Hudson, the general secretary of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament) is critical of the 2020 (Defender 2020) exercise of the current regime of the Iranian regime, as well as the current regime of the countries in which the virus is being controlled, saying: "In the current public-health crisis, it will not only endanger the lives of the forces of the countries participating from the US and many other European countries, but also the peoples."
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders on 14 March 2020 asking for help, stating that the United States is making it difficult for them to fight the outbreak as it lacks international market access to their country due to sanctions against Iran. This outbreak has made it difficult for other countries in the United States, such as other sub-Saharan countries, to call for public health services, universal child care, higher pay-for-home health care, and public health care.
Political analysts speculated that this could negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea deteriorated during the global pandemic.
"Following Japan's announcement to quarantine anyone arriving from South Korea for two weeks at a government-specified location, South Korea criticized Japan's ""unexplained and inactive quarantine efforts""."
South Korean society was initially at two opposite poles regarding President Moon Jae-in's reaction to the crisis.
The petition was signed by many Koreans calling for the dismissal of Moon, while many praised his response, claiming that the outbreak was mismanaged by the government. The global pandemic has given many countries the opportunity to enact emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that this could allow the government to reinforce their assertiveness over power.
In Hungary, its parliament granted Prime Minister Viktor Orban the right to rule indefinitely, to suspend parliament or run elections, and to punish respectable people who are spreading misinformation about how the disease is transmitted and the government's response to the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak is blamed for a shortage of supplies, an increase in the global use of materials needed to fight the pandemic, panic and disruption of factory and logistics operations.
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned of a shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to rising demand for buyers and disruption of suppliers.
Shopping was also seen in many areas due to panic, resulting in people buying more food items, toilet paper and essential groceries such as bottled water, causing a shortage in Jogane Ghogan.
The tech industry in particular has warned of delays in sending electrical products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand has increased the price of normal prices by twenty times and delayed the delivery of medical supplies by six months.
It created a worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment, and WHO warned that it would put health workers at risk.
This pandemic in Australia gives Daigoo sellers a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
The activity led to a shortage of baby formulas in some supermarkets, and the Australian government subsequently announced a ban. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, ensuring an overdose of food products, both areas have been wearing to keep themselves free from severe food shortages.
China and Italy's measures against stockpiling essential goods and illegal businesses have succeeded, avoiding the acute shortage of food in North America without Europe.
Although there is no significant decline in the agricultural produce of northern Italy, prices may rise, according to industry representatives.
When Chinese government officials gave up the pork stored in order to provide enough nutrition to the people, even in the city of Wuhan, they initially faced a shortage of food.
Italy has a similar national law that asks food producers to store food for such emergencies.
The damage to the global economy has also been felt in China: According to a media report on March 16, the Chinese economy has been hit very hard in the first two months of 2020 due to the government's measures to reduce the spread of the virus, and retail sales have fallen by 20.5%.
Since China's mainland plays a key role as a center of economy and production, the outbreak of the virus threatens to create a major destabilizing situation for the world economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicts that markets will remain variable until a more clear picture is revealed on the possible outcome.
In January 2020, some analysts speculated that the economic disaster caused by the pandemic could exceed the SARS outbreak of 2002–2004.
An expert at Washington University in St. Louis estimated that the world's supply chain suffered more than $300 billion in losses that could last up to two years.
"The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is said to have ""stucked out"" after oil prices fell sharply due to lower demand from China."
The global stock market collapsed on February 24 due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside of mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, multiple U.S. stock indices, including the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 indicator and the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted their sharpest decline since 2008, with Dow taking 1,191 points, the largest one-day fall since the 2007–08 financial crisis.
All three indices were up more than 10% at the end of the week.
On February 28, the Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
Fearing the coronavirus, the stock market fell again. The biggest fall was seen on March 16.
Many people are considering the possibility of a financial crisis.
Economist Muhammad El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures taken by the central bank and the state.
Central banks are dealing with the pace at which the financial crisis of 2008 has accelerated.
Tourism is one of the most affected departments due to the government's ban on tourism, all populated places, including the attractive tourism sector, and any travel restrictions across the globe.
As a result, multiple airlines, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, canceled flights for relatively low demand, as British regional airline Flybe crashed.
The impact on the maritime industry has never been seen before.
Many train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The main season of travel to China, called Chunun, began during the Chinese New Year holiday, when the pandemic began in China.
Many events where there may be a lot of public gatherings such as annual New Year's celebrations, etc. have been shut down by national and regional governments. Private companies are also closing their shops on their own, and various attractive tourist destinations such as Hong Kong's Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many lunar New Year celebrations and tourist gatherings, including the fairs of the banned cities and traditional temples in Beijing, have been closed to prevent public gatherings.
Officials in 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions extended New Year's holidays until February 10 and ordered most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions represent 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of the exports.
Hong Kong raised its infectious disease response levels to the maximum and declared a state of emergency, shutting schools until March and canceling New Year's celebrations. The global retail sector has been affected by the decline or temporary closure of shop openings.
In Europe and Latin America, sales fell by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East have seen a 50-60% decline.
As a result, the number of buyers at shopping centers decreased by 33–43% in March compared to February.
The global shopping mall managers imposed additional measures, such as increasing the health system, installing thermal scanners to check the temperature of buyers, and cancelling events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimates, the recession that began due to the global pandemic could have caused 14 to 22 million more people to extreme poverty than it would have been if the global pandemic had not been.
In January and February 2020, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs in a final phase of the pandemic in Wuhan.
Many of China’s nearly 300 million rural migrant workers have fallen into homelessness in inland areas or are stuck in Hubei province. More than 10 million Americans lost their jobs in March 2020 and applied for government assistance.
According to the calculations made by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, 47 million people in the United States could lose jobs as a result of the coronavirus outbreak and the unemployment rate could reach 32%. Millions of Indian migrant workers lost their jobs in India (those who lost almost 90% of their jobs per day since the lockdown in March 2020) are unemployed. 44% of the households in Canada are unemployed.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British employees applied for a universal credit project. Nearly half of Germany’s half-million companies sent their employees to a government-subsidized short-term action plan known as Kurtzerbet.
The German short-term compensation plan has also been adopted by France and Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by this pandemic, resulting in the activities of organizations as well as individuals - both employed and individual - being affected globally.
Institutions in the arts and culture field sought to maintain their own (often government-funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage in the community, to maintain the safety of their workers and people, and to cooperate with artists wherever possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, theaters and other cultural institutions around the world were closed indefinitely, either by cancelling or delaying their exhibitions, events, and performances.
There was a concerted effort to provide alternative services through digital platforms in response. Another recent and rapidly growing consequence of the disease is religious services, major sporting events and concerts and other social events such as concerts, technology conferences, and fashion shows.
The film industry also saw a breakdown. The Vatican declared the holy week in Rome the last week of Christian Lent’s regrettable season as cancelled.
Many Dioceses have advised older Christians to stay at home rather than come on Sundays; some Church services are available via radio, online live streaming, or television, while others are organizing worship by not getting out of the car.
With the closure of its churches and chapels by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome and the disappearance of the Christian Pilgrims in St. Peter's Square, other religious congregations also canceled services and restricted public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurudwaras.
Iran's health ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak, and later religious sites were closed, and Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as residents of the country to the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic is the most significant disaster in the world's sporting calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, the UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season, have either been canceled or postponed.
"This outbreak has disrupted the plan for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which was originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event ""will not take place after the summer of 2021 if rescheduled to a date after 2020"".
Reports of a significant increase in new sign-ups on gambling sites suggest that this has resulted in many gamblers moving online. In order to postpone or cancel various music groups Jalsar tours, the entertainment industry has also been affected.
Many big theaters, such as Broadway, have suspended all performances.
"Some artists continued to compose and share art through the Internet as an alternative to traditional live shows, such as live streaming of concerts or creating web-based ""festivals"" so that artists could perform, distribute and promote their work."
Online, the fire has spread to the internet's memes of the coronavirus theme, which is too ridiculous and removes the eye from this uncertain time.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, fear of foreigners and nationalism against people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and even against people from hotspot areas in Europe, the United States, and other countries.
In many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region, there have been instances of fear, suspicion and hostility.
Cases reported since February have documented racist attitudes against groups of Chinese people around the world, where they deserve the virus or what is being done to them is claimed as fair retribution.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-China sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported that they were discriminated based on regional origins.
There was support for the Chinese both online and offline, and there was also support for people in the virus-affected areas.
Italy may be the first country in Europe to experience the dreaded COVID-19 outbreak, according to the progress of the outbreak in new hotspot countries. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions/applications to lobby for the ban on Chinese people entering their country in an attempt to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag <0x23>Chinesearajapaneabenna became very popular.
As well as racial abuse against Chinese as well as other Asians living in the UK and the United States, attacks are reported to be on the rise.
"US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as a ""Chinese virus"", as critics consider the phrase to be racist and anti-Chinese."
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian residents and foreign passengers from Wuhan to Nabi Sanjahari.
Students from Northeast India, which shares a border with China, who are studying in India's major cities, are reported to have been subjected to harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.
"Dilip Ghosh, president of the West Bengal state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and ""that's why God took revenge on them."""
The Chinese Consulate in Kolkata has sharply criticized the comments, calling them "mistakes". Genophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents in China have increased during the pandemic, where foreigners are described as "foreign garbage" and have been identified as "exhausting."
There are several other newspapers, including Paywall, that have removed them from their partial or complete coronavirus coverage.
Many specific publications have created science-related works that are available in open access.
Some scientists are quick to publish their results on some innovative servers, such as Bioroxy.

Laboratory tests for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 viruses include procedures that identify the presence of the virus and the antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of the virus in the samples is confirmed by the RT-PCR, which identifies the coronavirus RNA.
The test is specific and only designed to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to ensure a very recent or active infection.
Antibody detection (Serology) can be used for both diagnosis and surveillance of people.
Antibody tests show how many people had the disease, including those who were too small to report symptoms or those who were symptomless.
A correct mortality rate of the disease and group immunity in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country had reliable information on the outbreak of the virus in their population.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and there is a huge difference in how many tests have been done across different countries.
This difference will likely significantly affect the reported case mortality rate, which is likely to be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Respiratory samples obtained through a variety of methods, including nasopharyngeal soybeans, can be tested using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR).
Results are usually seen in a few hours to two days.
The RT-PCR test performed with throat swab is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
The virus may later disappear from the throat, but the number of lungs may increase.
In the case of infected people tested in the second week, otherwise the sample material can be taken from the depths of the respiratory tract by the suction catheter, or the object (sputum) emitted with a cough can be used.
One of the initial PCR tests was prepared in January 2020 at Charit<0xC3><0xA9> in Berlin, using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and it formed the basis for 250,000 kits to be delivered by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also made a test by 23 January 2020. The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical-based PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerChek coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
"This is the common ""E"" gene contained in all beta coronaviruses and the characteristic RdRp gene of SARS-CoV-2. The BGI Group in China was one of the first companies to deliver through the RRTSO 2019 to the National Medical Products Administration of China, which received emergency use authorisation for a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit at the time of the coronavirus (PRCentroles for Disease Control and Prevention) in the United States."
One of the three genetic tests of older versions of test kits caused unresolved results and one of the obstacles to testing at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in the successful processing of less than 100 samples a day on average throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not determined to be reliable until February 28, 2020, and state and local laboratories were not allowed to start testing until then.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use approval. U.S. business labs began testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of COVID-19 testing on a nationwide RT-PCR basis.
Quest Diagnostics also made available nationwide COVID-19 testing on March 9, 2020.
Quantitative limitations have not been announced; the collection and processing of samples must be carried out as per the CDC requirements.
The COVID-19 test in Russia was prepared and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology, VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare. On 12 March 2020, reports were found that Mayo Clinic had prepared a test to detect COVID-19 infections. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that would have been performed over a period of about 3.5 hours, thus allowing a 24-hour instrument
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted Abbott Laboratories Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for a test on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously granted similar approvals to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid received the EUA from the FDA for a test, which took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a periodic temperature cycle, this method can give positive results in as little as five minutes and can give negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 devices in the U.S. and Abbott hopes to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day. A test uses a monoclonal antibody, which is precisely tied to the new coronavirus’s nucleocapacid protein (N protein), and is just as likely to produce this test in 15 to 20 minutes as a rapid influenza test.
"A literature review in March 2020 concluded that ""the importance of chest radiographs in the initial stages is very low in diagnosis, but data from CT [computed tomography] may even have existed before the onset of symptoms."""
CT features include an edged, asymmetrical and backward distribution including bidirectional, multilobber ground-glass opaqueness.
With the emergence of the disease, subpolar domination, crazie paving and consolidation occur.
A study comparing PCR with CT in Wuhan, the epicentre of the current pandemic, suggests that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less precise, and that many of the characteristics of taking pictures of it coincide with other pneumonia and disease processes.
"In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that ""CT should not be used as a first-line test for COVID-19 or for pathogens""."
Antibody production, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to infection.
They can be used to detect infections in humans, to determine immunity and to monitor people from 7 days after the onset of symptoms. Evaluations can be carried out by point-of-care testing at central laboratories, CLT and at the care site of PoCT.
High-performance automated systems in many essential laboratories will be able to perform these asses, but their availability will depend on the rate of production for each system.
A single sample of endogenous blood for CLT is commonly used, although sequential samples may also be used to follow an immune response.
A single sample of blood is usually taken by pores on the skin for PoCT.
An extraction step is not required before testing like the PCR method. On March 26, 2020, the FDA announced the names of 29 entities that had provided the agency with the notification as required and now they are therefore able to distribute their antibody tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test has been approved under an emergency use authorization by the FDA. In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against viruses in blood samples.
The test's capacity is several hundred samples in a few hours, and therefore is much faster than the traditional PCR assessment of viral RNA.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after the onset of the infection. In early April, the UK found that their purchase of an antibody test kit was not good enough to use.
"Hong Kong has developed a scheme in which suspected patients can stay at home, ""the emergency department will give the patient a sample tube"", he will spit in it, send it back to the patient and get the test results shortly after the procedure. The British NHS has announced that the patient is launching a plan on an experimental basis to be able to use a swab in case of suspected cases to test the patient at home, or to eliminate the risk of infecting other people by the patient when they go to a hospital."
Drive-through centers have helped South Korea conduct the fastest, most comprehensive tests in any country. The National Association of Statistics Health Insurance Physicians in Germany said on March 2 that they have the capacity to conduct about 12,000 tests per day in their mobile setting and 10.700 people were tested in the previous week.
When the test is ordered by a doctor, health insurance costs are borne.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On 19 March, drive-in tests were provided in many major cities.
The total number of tests completed in Germany on 26 March 2020 was unknown, as only positive cases were reported.
"A first lab study revealed that a total of 483,295 samples were tested at least as of 12/2020 calendar week up to 12/2020, including more than 10,491 samples tested on 12/2020, and 33,491 samples were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on an "emergency" test, in the case of the lab-tested labs (6.9%) in Israel.
Supervision of construction work by BGI founder Wang <0x58>ian and modelling of it within 5 days showed that if the test capacity was not increased in time, the incidence in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the cost of quarantine would have doubled.
Huo-Yan labs have quickly followed Wuhan laboratory in a total of 12 cities across China, such as Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai.
By 4 March 2020, the testing capacity was a total of 50,000 per day. Open source, multiplexed designs published by Origami Assays have been released that can test a maximum of 1122 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced designs can be run in small laboratories without the need for a robotic liquid handler.
By March, the lack of reagents and insufficient amounts of reagents had become a constraint on mass testing in the European Union and the United Kingdom and the United States.
Because of this, some researchers explored the sample preparation protocol where samples were heated for 5 minutes at 98 <0xC2><0xB0>C (208 <0xC2><0xB0>F) to free up RNA genomes for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that the UAE was now testing more people for the coronavirus than any other country and that testing levels were on the way to increase to reach the majority of the population.
"This was done through a combination of drive-through capability and a population-scale mass-production laboratory purchase from Group 42 and BGI (based on their ""Huo-Yan"" emergency detection laboratories in China)."
The lab, built in 14 days, is capable of performing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day, and is the first lab in the world to operate outside of China.
Various testing methods were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States targeting different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus.
The World Health Organization (WHO) adopted the German system of producing kits sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to make their own kits.
The German system was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol prepared by the United States Centers for Disease Control (United States Centers for Disease Control) was not available until 28 January, which delayed the tests available in the US. There were problems between China and the United States with the reliability of testing kits in the early stages of the disease outbreak.
In contrast, experts say that excessive testing in South Korea has helped to reduce the spread of the coronavirus.
Over the years, the South Korean administration has developed the ability to test primarily in private-sector labs.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for an increase in testing programs as the best way to slow the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increased demand for testing due to the widespread transmission of the virus led to the creation of millions of test pending jobs in private U.S. labs, and pressure on the supply of swabs and chemical breakers.
In March 2020, China reported problems with accuracy in their test kits.
"There was a ""error"" in the test kits prepared by the CDC in the United States; then the administration removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented private testing. Spain bought the test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioaesy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were incorrect."
The company explained that the incorrect results could result in the failure to collect samples or use the kits properly.
The Spanish Ministry said that they would withdraw the kits given the wrong results, and replace them with a different kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasay. The Czech Republic gave 80% of the wrong results of the test kits that it bought from China. Slovakia bought 1.2 million test kits from China that were found to be incorrect.
"Prime Minister Matovic (Matovi<0xC4><0x8D>) proposed to drop them into the Danube River. Ate<0xC5><0x9F> Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said there was a ""high rate of error"" in the test kits that the turkey bought from China and they ""did not use them." The UK first bought 3.5 million test kits from China but announced that they were not used."
Testing and then quarantine those who tested positive and finding people who had contact with SARS-CoV-2 positive resulted in positive results.
In Italy, where the first death toll from COVID-19 was recorded, researchers working in the Italian city of Voe conducted a two-point experiment over a 10-day interval over the entire population of 3,400 people.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms and all those who were identified were placed in quarantine.
Controlling traffic in the community has led to the complete elimination of new infections.
The 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has progressed much slower than in other developed countries, without any extreme controls such as aggressively detecting people coming in contact, inbound travel controls, testing and quarantines, but forcing restaurants and retail outlets to close.
Many events have been canceled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay at home on March 28, but schools reopened on time after a holiday break on March 23.
Several other countries have also aggressively searched for people who have come in contact, through inbound travel control, testing, and quarantine, but have controlled the pandemic globally with less aggressive lock-downs, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that tested more than the number of deaths had a much lower mortality rate, because perhaps these countries have also been able to identify patients with mild or no symptoms.
The WHO recommends that countries that do not have the ability to test and that national laboratories have limited experience with COVID-19 should send the first five positive and the first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the WHO's 16 reference laboratories for confirmation tests.
Among the 16 reference laboratories, there are 7 in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
"The ""What percentage of tests are positive"" column in the chart below is influenced by the test policy of that country."
In a country where only hospitalised people are tested, the positive percentage will be higher than in a country where everything else is equal, whether people have symptoms or not all citizens are tested.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand hygiene, refers to the act of washing a person's hands with the purpose of removing soil, grease, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
"Regular hand washing with soap at certain ""important moments"" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the passage of the stool - mouth."
People may also be affected by respiratory diseases such as influenza or common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five important moments of the day when washing hands with soap are: before and after defecation, after cleaning the baby's lower jaw or changing nappies, before feeding the baby, before eating and before and after making food or giving raw meat, fish, or poultry hands.
Hands can be washed with ash if water and soap are not available. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing:
Before, during, and after cooking.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing the diaper or cleaning the child who has used the toilet.
After your nose, cough or sneeze.
After touching animal, animal feed, or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to healthy habits related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before taking medication or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main purpose of hand washing is to keep the hands clean from pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that may cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harmful or disease.
This is especially important for people who care about or work in the medical field, but it is also an important method for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the transmission of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing the infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the infant mortality rate during delivery at home.
A 2013 study found that improved hand washing habits could drive children under the age of five to grow in length to a lesser extent.
In developing countries, introducing simple behavioral changes such as washing hands with soap can reduce the mortality rate of children related to respiratory and diarrhoea.
This simple procedure can reduce the death rate from the disease by about 50%.
The measures adopted to encourage hand washing can reduce the diarrhoea phase by about a third, and this is comparable to the supply of clean water in low-income areas.
Hand washing with soap is associated with a 48% reduction in diarrhoea incidence. Hand washing with soap is the only most effective and affordable way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI). Hand washing is performed as an automatic practice in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, which is a major ARI, is the leading cause of death among children under the age of five. It takes the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children every year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia cause about 3.5 million child deaths each year.
According to the UNICEF, hand washing with soap before eating and after using the toilet can save more lives than a vaccine or medical intervention, reduce death by about half in diarrhoea and reduce death by one-fourth from acute respiratory infections.
Handwashing as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs is integrated with other sanitation systems.
Handwashing protects against infectious skin disease (impetigo) that is transmitted through direct physical contact.
One of the effects of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage due to dry skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to an itching, skin irritation condition known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among healthcare workers.
Hand washing is also a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
The five important times of the day when it is important to wash your hands with soap to reduce the spread of the disease: after using the bathroom (flushing, defecation), after cleaning the baby's lower jaw or changing the nape, before feeding the baby, before eating and before preparing food or handing it to raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other times when the right hand washing technique should be applied to prevent infection include before and after treatment of cuts or wounds; after sneezing, coughing, or sneezing; after touching the animal waste or after sneezing the animal; and after touching the garbage.
In many countries, the rate of hand washing with soap is very low.
A 2015 study of hand washing in 54 countries found that on average 38.7% of households used to wash their hands with soap. A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of washing at 97 percent; in the United States about 77 percent; and in China there was the lowest rate of hand washing at a rate of 23 percent per day in the country. The practice of hand washing with soap at the time of crisis is now the practice of changing several existing habits for children.
"The ""Essential Health Care Program"" implemented by the Education Department of the Philippines is an example of adequate measures to promote the health and education of children."
The main theme of such a program is to rinse twice a year, wash your hands with soap every day, brush your teeth with fluoride.
It has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Adding soap or detergent to water increases the elimination of microorganisms from the skin.
The main function of soaps and detergents is to reduce the inhibition of the solution and increase the solubleity.
Only water is ineffective skin cleanser (skin cleanser) because fat and protein, which are organic soil components, do not dissolve easily in water.
Cleaning is definitely done with the help of a limited flow of water.
Nitrate soap, due to its reusable nature, can hold bacteria derived from previous use.
A small number of studies that aimed at the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soaps concluded that the transfer was less likely because the bacteria were washed with foam.
"The CDC still says that ""the use of liquid soaps that can be controlled without the use of hands is recommended""."
There has been a lot of publicity about the health-consciousness of antibacterial soaps.
To date, no evidence has been found of using the recommended antiseptic or disinfectant for nature's antibiotic-resistant organisms.
Antibacterial soaps, however, contain common antibacterial ingredients such as triclosan, which have the ability to resist organism to a greater extent.
Thus, although antibiotic resistant strains are not selected for antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are marketed.
In addition to the surfactant and skin-protective ingredients, in sophisticated preparation, the synthesis of acids (acetic acids, ascorbic acids, lactic acids) as well as the subcutaneous subcutaneous subcutaneous soaps, antimicrobialally active benzoic acids and additional skin conditioners of the school may contain extracts (alovera, vitamins, mentles, plant extracts)
Warm water is not enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow very quickly at body temperature (37<0xC2><0xB0>C).
But hot soap water is more effective than cold soap water to remove the natural oils that hold the soil and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific research has shown that the use of warm water has no effect on reducing the microbial load in the hand.
A hand sanitiser or hand antiseptic that is not water-based is a hand-cleaning element.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-alcoholic rubs began to gain popularity with hand cleaning ingredients (also known as alcohol-based rubs, antiseptic hand rubs, or hand sanitizers).
To reduce the ease of use and the drying effect of alcohol, most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol prepared together with a thicker material such as carbohydrates (polymers of acrylic acids) in gels such as liquids or glycerin in the foam.
Adding mixed hydrogen-peroxide further enhances antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizer contains a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol that is efficient at killing germs.
Alcohol rub sanitizers kill bacteria, multiple drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol rub sanitizer contains 70% alcohol which kills 99.97% (equivalent to a reduction of 3.5 decibels) after 30 seconds of application in the hand and kills 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 log reduction) bacteria after 1 minute of use in the hand. Hand sanitizers are the most effective against bacteria and are less than a few viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis, which is almost completely ineffective against the virus of the type Norovirus (or Norwalk). Two hands should be used to best squeak or use enough hand antiseptics or alcohol rubs to propagate.
The liquid, foam or gel is rubbed for about 30 seconds on the front and back of both hands and the middle of the fingers until it dries out.
Fingernails also need to be thoroughly washed with two palms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing with hand sanitizer, especially if dirt is found in the hands.
The increasing use of these ingredients depends on the ease of use and the rapid elimination of microorganisms; however, soap and water should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing if they are not available.
If the formula does not contain emulsifiers and/or skin moisturizers, frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin.
Adding glycerin and/or other lotions to the formula can reduce or eliminate the effect of alcohol drying.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing milder ingredients caused significantly less tension and dryness in the skin than soaps or disinfectant detergents.
Hypersensitivity alcohol hand rubs rarely occur for allergic contact dermatitis, contact-induced abdominal disease or analgesic substances present in alcohol or alcohol.
Compared to hand washing with soap and water, the lower tendency to initiate painful touch dermatitis was a cause of attraction.
Despite their effectiveness, water-free ingredients do not clean the organic matter of the hand, but simply disinfect the hand.
Since pathogens still remain in the hands, this is why effective hand sanitizers such as soap and water are not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogens.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizer depends more on the ingredients and preparation, and has done significantly less work than alcohol and alcohol rubs in the past.
More recently, after the application of benzalconium chloride user preparation, there has been a steady and growing antimicrobial activity that is not like alcohol, which has likely seen a decrease in efficacy after repeated use due to a progressive adverse skin reaction.
In a low-income society, many people do not have the money for soap and instead they use ash or soil.
Ash or soil can be more effective than just water, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it can increase the spread of the disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because it produces alkaline solution in contact with water.
If soap is not available, WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap.
The correct hand washing techniques recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent disease transmission include the following steps:
Wash your hands with warm or cold water.
Water is recommended because permanent basins can be contaminated, but the temperature of the water does not seem to make any difference.
Raise the foam of the soap with enough soap in the back of the hand, in the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin and studies have shown that people wash their hands better when they use soap instead of just water.
Stir for at least 20 seconds.
During scrubbing, there is abrasion that removes germs from the skin and for a long time more germs are removed.
Wash well with water.
Hands can be re-contaminated by washing in the basin.
Dry with a clean towel or let it dry in the air.
Wet and moist hands are more easily re-polluted. The places that are most neglected are the place between the fingers, wrists, fingers and the bottom of the nails.
Artificial nails and cracked nail polish can protect the microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended so that the hands do not become dry; dry skin can cause damage to the skin which can increase the risk of spreading the infection.
"In developing countries where tap call water and/or soap are not available, a variety of low-cost alternatives can be made to facilitate hand washing, for example by pouring water from hanging zircon or suitable holed lou and/or using ash if necessary. In situations of limited water supply (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are other ""low-cost" water-saving alternatives such as ""TP-tap""."
Tip-tap is a simple technique where a jug wrapped by rope and a foot-powered lever and a piece of soap are used to pour a small amount of water into the hands.
Hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective type of drying in a public washroom.
An increasing amount of research indicates that paper towels are much healthier than the electric hand dryers seen in many washrooms.
Paper towels, warm-air hand dryers and more modern jet-air hand dryers were produced by the paper towel industry European tissue symposium in 2008 and a study was conducted by the University of Westminster in London.
After washing hands and drying with warm-air dryers, the total number of bacteria increased by an average of 194% on the finger and 254% on the palm of the hand.
Drying with a jet-air dryer increases the total number of bacteria by an average of 42% on the finger and 15% on the palm of the hand.
After drying hands with paper towels after hand washing, on average up to 76% of the bacteria in the fingers and up to 77% of the total bacteria in the palm of the hand. The method of each type of drying was also tested to prove whether there was a possibility of pollution (rush-contamination) spread from place to place by other washroom users and washroom environments.
The jet-air dryer, which ejected air at a sustained speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to blow out microorganisms from the hands and the unit, and remove up to 2 meters of potential pollution from the washroom users and the washroom environment.
The use of a warm-air hand dryer spreads the microscopic organism up to 0.25 meters away from the dryer.
Paper towels showed no significant prevalence of micro-organisms. A study conducted in 2005, conducted by T<0xC3><0x9C>V Product und Umwelt, evaluated various hand drying methods.
The following changes have been noticed in the number of bacteria after washing hands:
There are many different types of hand dryer manufacturers that exist and compared hand dryers with drying with paper towels.
Hand washing is an alternative to using hand sanitising wipes due to the lack of soap and water during travel.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing became mandatory long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semelwes discovered the effectiveness of hand washing in 1846 to prevent disease in the hospital environment.
There are some electronic devices that give feedback to remind hospital staff that they forget to wash their hands.
A study has shown that the rate of infection decreases with the use of them.
Medical handwashing is done for a minimum of 15 seconds, and each part of the hand is used with a sufficient amount of soap and water or gel to rub the foam.
The fingers should be rubbed together.
A bristle brush can be used to remove it if there is dirt under the nails.
Since germs can be in the water at hand, it is important to wash the foam thoroughly and dry it with a clean towel.
After drying, paper towels should be used to close the water faucet (and open another door to drain out if necessary).
This helps to prevent the contamination of the hands from these surfaces again.
"The purpose of hand washing in a healthcare environment is to remove pathogens (""biodegradable"") and prevent infection."
The New England Journal of Medicine reported that the shortage of hand washing remains at an unacceptable level in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus causing an infection of microbes.
One study found that the right hand-washing and other simple methods could reduce the rate of infection of catheter-related blood flow by 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published the standard hand-washing and hand-washing display letter in the Department of Health Care.
Draft guidelines for hand hygiene by the organization for public comments can also be found on its website.
A relevant review was conducted by Whitby and others.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene if regulatory compliance verification is required.
"The World Health Organization has ""five moments"" for hand washing:"
After coming into contact with blood/body fluid
Prior to the release of the disease, and
"After taking care of the patient. Antiseptic chemical additives (""medical"" or ""antimicrobial"" soap) in soap provide the ability to destroy the hand wash material."
Before surgery or in places where antibiotic-resistant organisms are present, the removal of these functions may be impaired. For surgical purposes, it is important to have a call to 'screw' your hands, which can be turned on and off without touching your hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine to clean the bottom of the nostrils, and other disinfectant towels for washing hands after washing.
All decorations must be opened.
This method usually requires washing up to 2-6 minutes of hands and elbows.
It is not necessary to rub the hands for a long time (10 minutes).
During washing, the water from the wrist to the elbow must be prevented from moving back to the palm of the hand.
After the hand wash is finished, the hand is washed with sterile cloth and a surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands before and after visiting the sick person or using antiseptics.
For the control of Staphylococcus infection in the hospital, it was found that the maximum benefit of hand-washing was from the first 20% wash, and that there were very few additional benefits when the repetition of hand-cleaning was increased to over 35%.
Washing with ordinary soap compared to washing with antibacterial soap causes three times the rate of bacterial infectious diseases in food. Compared to hand-washing with alcohol-based solution with hand-washing with antibacterial soap over a period of 30 seconds, each showed that the exposure to alcohol reduced by 26 percent compared to hand-washing with an alcohol-based solution.
However, soap and water/water are more effective than alcohol-based hand rubs to reduce H1N1 influenza A virus and claustridium difficile seedlings from hand to hand. Handwashing may involve personnel education and personnel written and oral reminders about the availability of alcohol-based hand rubs to improve hand hygiene in healthcare environments.
More research is needed to find out which of these improvements are most effective in different healthcare environments.
Hand washing with soap is recognized as an affordable, essential way to achieve good health, even good nutrition in developing countries.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces creates a challenge for achieving universal hand washing habits.
For example, although there are cheaper options for making hand washing spaces in most areas of rural Africa, there are very few hand washing calls near every private or public toilet.
However, the low hand washing rate can certainly be due to deeply rooted habits, rather than soap or water/water shortages.
Promoting and advising hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing, and lead to changes in people's long-term habits.
It needs to be monitored and evaluated to work efficiently.
"A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based methods at LMICs are less effective in hand washing, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of UNICEF's ""Three Star Approach"" campaign on hand washing in schools is to encourage schools to take simple, affordable steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap among other healthy requirements."
If the minimum standards are achieved, schools can reach three stars from one to the last.
Establishing a hand wash station may be part of a campaign to help reduce disease and infant mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness campaign that is trying to change habits. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the recognition of handwashing emojis.
DALYS has considered a number of studies on the prevention of hand washing in developing countries.
However, a review suggests that the promotion of hand washing with soap is comparatively more affordable than other water/water and sanitation systems.
"The importance of hand washing for human health - especially for people in vulnerable situations, such as mothers in hospitals who have given birth to babies or injured soldiers - was recognized by two pioneers of hand hygiene in the first half of the 19th century: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semelewes who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, an ""modern nurse""."
By that time most people believed that the infection was caused by a bad smell called miasmas.
In the 1980s, food-borne disease outbreaks and healthcare-related infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
With the outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, many countries have raised awareness about the importance of hand washing with soap to protect themselves from this type of infectious disease.
"For example, posters with ""right hand washing techniques"" in Germany were shoved in public toilets and next to hand washing sinks in office buildings and airport toilets."
"Such a phrase ""throwing a person's hand"" means taking responsibility for the matter or expressing a person's disapproval of being a partner in wrongdoing."
Its origins come from the biblical part of Matthew where Pontius Pilate threw his hands away from the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a language publication by more widespread use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to wash her hands in an attempt to clean up her crazy-like fantasies by revealing her sense of guilt about the crime she had committed and instigated her husband to commit.
It has also been observed that people, when they think or think of immoral acts, tend to wash their hands much more than others, and are prone to overprice hand washing tools.
"Furthermore, those who have been allowed to wash their hands after such intent are less likely to engage in compensatory activities, such as volunteering."
Religions command hand washing for both healthy and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, not using water/water for hand washing but not using soap, is a part of religious rituals characterized by many religions, including Bah<0xC3><0xA1>’<0xC3><0xAD> religion, Hinduism, Tevilah and Natal<0xC3><0xA1>t Yad<0xC3><0xAD>m in Judaism. Some of the rituals then direct hand washing, the lavabo of Christianity, and the practice of performing some rituals, especially in Islam.
Washing hands is mandatory in Hinduism, Judaism and Islam.
And, it is mandatory to wash hands every time before and after meals in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam.
Workplace Risk Control for COVID-19
Workplace risk controls for COVID-19 are the application of occupational safety and health-related procedures to control risk to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Depending on the appropriate risk controls in the workplace and the work to be done, a risk assessment of the sources of contact, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors for individual workers who may be at risk of COVID-19 infection.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the United States, jobs with a lower risk of exposure have minimal professional contact with people and other colleagues, for which general measures to prevent infection are recommended, including washing hands, encouraging employees to stay home if they are sick, cleaning respiratory hygiene, and regularizing the work environment.
Medium-risk jobs in contact include jobs that are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but require frequent or close contact with people who may be infected due to the ongoing disease spreading among the public at the business place or due to international travel.
This includes employees who have contact with the public, such as in schools, in high-density work environments, and in some overcrowded retail environments.
In addition to the initial infection prevention measures, the group's risk control measures include using improved capacity air filters to keep ventilation, snooze guards and personal protective equipment available when faced with a COVID-19 infected person.
The OSHA considers the risk of exposure to COVID-19 infected people who are suspected or suspected of being infected by health workers and people working in morgues to be high. This increases the risk if these workers apply aerosol-promoting procedures or collect samples of people with COVID-19 who are in a confirmed or suspected condition through this process or handle samples.
Risk controls suitable for these workers include engineering controls such as negative-pressure air circulation chambers, and personal protective materials suitable for job work.
The spread of COVID-19 in the workplace can have many effects.
Employees may be absent from work due to illness, fear of being taken care of by others, or possible contact.
There is a demand for goods and the way in which these products are purchased (e.g. by way of shopping or delivery or drive-thru services (not by car) can change the nature of the business from both sides.
Finally, sending goods from geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be hindered. Preparation and response planning for an infectious disease can be used to guide preventive measures.
Plans target risk levels associated with different workplaces and actions, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from home and society, and personal risk factors for employees, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also describe the controls necessary to address those risks and the plans to be prepared for the situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak of the disease.
Preparedness and response plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national or sub-national recommendations.
The objectives of response to the outbreak include reducing transmission among employees, protecting people at risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations, and reducing adverse effects on other companies in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community where the business is located affects the accepted responses.
The orderly format of risk control is a structure that is widely used to control occupational safety and health effectiveness.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be overcome, the most effective controls are engineering control, then administrative control, and finally personal protection equipment.
Engineering controls involve separating employees from work-related risks without relying on employee behavior, and may be the most cost-effective solution to implementing it.
Administrative controls are changes in work policies or procedures that require action by an employee or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative control, but it can help prevent some exposure.
All types of PPE should be selected based on the risk of the worker, such as the appropriate fit (such as the respirator), continuous and appropriate wear, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced, and properly opened, cleaned, and stored or cancelled to avoid contamination.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, people with a lower risk of exposure have minimal professional contact with other people and colleagues.
The basic steps to prevent infection recommended for all workplaces include washing hands frequently and thoroughly, encouraging employees to stay at home if they are sick, providing mouth-covered respiratory hygiene, tissue and garbage disposal during sneezing and coughing, maintaining telecommunication or cleaning equipment at different times of the day, preparing other personnel for the use of telecommunication and cleaning equipment, and equipment at different times of the day.
An essential step in protecting employees, customers, interviewers, and others in the workplace is to quickly identify and isolate potentially infectious individuals.
Workers who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness are advised to stay at home by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, unless they are getting rid of fever, fever symptoms, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using fever-reducing or other symptom-changing medications, and should be flexible with sick leave policies, which allow employees to remain at home to care for a sick family member, and to have a policy of substitution.
According to OSHA, medium-risk jobs in contact include jobs that are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but are either due to the ongoing disease spreading among the public at the business place or due to a recent international travel to a place where the person has been exposed to COVID-19. People who may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 need close contact (1.8 m).
Those employees include those with whom the public has to be in contact, such as in the workplace, in schools, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, and in the workplaces in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, and in the workplaces of the workplaces and in the workplaces of the workplaces. These are the workplaces of the workplaces and the workplaces of the workplaces of the workplaces.
Employees in this risk group are required to use a respirator in rare cases.
If a person is sick on an airplane, appropriate controls to protect staff and other passengers include separating the sick person from others at a distance of 6 feet, specifying a member of the staff to serve the sick person, and asking the sick person to provide a face mask or to cover his mouth and nose with tissues during sneezing or coughing.
Cabin crews should wear disposable medical gloves when responding to a sick traveler's call or when touching fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces of the body, and if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough or shortness of breath, perhaps additional personal protective equipment should be used.
Gloves and other removable items should be discarded in a bio-hazard bag, and contaminated surfaces should then be cleaned and disinfected. For commercial vessels, including recreational vessels and other passenger vessels, the risk controls include postponement of travel if sick, isolate yourself and inform the ship’s medical center immediately if someone has a fever or other symptoms while on board.
In the ideal case, the person who has been isolated should have medical follow-up in the cabin. In the case of school and child care facilities, regardless of the infection in the community, if an infected person enters the school building, the CDC recommends a short-term closure to clean or disinfect it.
When the disease spreads from a minimum to a medium level within the public, social distancing strategies may be implemented, such as canceling field trips, gatherings, and other large gatherings, such as physical education or eating in concerted music classes or cafeterias; increasing the distance between desks, coming to the office and using vacation time to isolate, limiting unnecessary interviewers to a place for children, and the flu.
When the disease spreads in large numbers in the local community, additional school closures may be considered as an extension of the social distancing strategy. The immediate risk to the health of the implementing workers is considered low by the CDC, which implements laws that carry out daily routine activities.
Law enforcement officers who are required to contact people who have or are suspected of having COVID-19 are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If employees come in close contact during fear, they should be cleaned and disinfected using a domestic cleaning spray or wipe before reusing their duty belts and equipment, and should follow evidence management procedures to control and discard the used PPE.
OSHA considers certain health care and death-related services personnel in the high or very high risk category of contact.
High-risk jobs in contact include healthcare supplies, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who come in contact with patients who are known to have or are suspected to have COVID-19.
If employees perform aerosol-derived procedures, or collect or move samples from patients who are known to have COVID-19 or are suspected, they become at high risk of exposure.
Aerosol-derived methods include tube insertion, cough-inducing procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and testing or collecting samples by entering materials.
High exposure risk, death-related jobs include employees involved in preparing people who were known to have COVID-19 at the time of death or were suspected to have had their bodies; this becomes very high exposure risk if they perform post-mortems. Additional engineering controls for people with this risk group are also included in the procedure when there are known or suspected to have COVID-19.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be suitable for some health care and aquatic environments.
The samples should be operated according to the precautions of Biosafety Level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be isolated in isolated waiting areas on the basis of whether they are suspected to have COVID-19. Those who are known to have SARS-CoV-2 or are suspected to have been working within 6 feet of them, and OSHA recommends a respirator for people performing aerosol-providing procedures, in addition to other PPE.
A NIOSH-approved N95 or better filtering facepiece receptor must be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program, including health tests, training, and medical tests in the United States.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve employee comfort. WHO does not recommend coveralls, since COVID-19 does not spread through physical fluid components, but rather it is a respiratory disease.
The WHO only recommends a surgical mask for screening personnel at the entrance.
WHO recommends a surgical mask, goggles, or face shields, gowns, and gloves for those who are collecting respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients without any aerosol-derived procedures.
If an aerosol-derivative process is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given the inadequacies of the global PPE supply, WHO recommends using physical insulators such as telemedicine, transparent windows to reduce the need for PPE, and only those who are directly involved in the caregiving have been allowed to enter the home of a patient with COVID-19, not allowing only one person to have a mask in the house, and not having the necessary PPE to be monitored for specific work, continue to use the PPE without removing the respirator while taking care for multiple patients with the same disease.

We are in a very difficult situation this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic is an event that makes global human interaction and makes us clear of our responsibilities towards each other.
We have no precedent for its challenges before us, but we know that our best response depends on the global empathy, cooperation and society at the heart of this organization.
The intimacy, trust and care we have seen through emails, calls and chats among all our colleagues is a remarkable product of the incredible people we are fortunate enough to work with.
I am so grateful and proud to have you all as a partner.
Last week, a man shared his appreciation for our work with me.
They reminded me of how important it is to be able to see Wikipedia for the world at the moment and how powerful this important resource is to be available online and to everyone.
Your work makes it possible for you to keep the sites on, or pay our colleagues, or keep our communities safe no matter what.
The information provided by Wikipedia is needed in the world, to a greater extent now than ever before.
This is a moment where not only what we do, but how we do it will also have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some significant changes from this week to the way we work together.
Keeping up with our work and schedules
As Robin mentioned earlier, the C-team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
We thought it was the right response to the situation we were facing, and we considered in that conversation the best way to sustain the company at this time.
Most of us wanted to relieve stress and support our purpose for the long term.
It's not a problem if you need to back up your data.
For all employees, contractors, and contract workers:
Our daily work expectations will be around 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We're not announcing a holiday - if you're able to work in a more normal time, the mission may employ you.
But at the moment the world is uncertain, and whether you need to take care of your loved one or bring groceries or go to the doctor, your well being is our priority.
We're not looking at your time.
Don't work when you're sick.
It's important to say it, but we're saying it.
No sick leave or PTO is required - just tell your manager and help your team revise the calendars and schedules, to make sure the key areas of work are covered.
(If you're positive for COVID-19, please let T&C Ops' Brian know so that T&C can help and make sure your situation gets proper attention from the authorities).
Full pay will be given to those who work as hours.
We have already said, and we are once again committed to honoring our commitment to our contractors and hourly workers.
All will be paid on the basis of normal hours of their working under normal circumstances.
This includes if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we will help you.
Many people use work as a way to drive their stress from the world around us to a certain direction.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like these.
Again, it's about taking care of yourself.
We want you to keep in touch with your manager, so we know what to expect and adjust accordingly.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are some things that we need to do.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and Fundraising teams (among others) do essential work that may require additional support.
We will start a process with all of our departments to evaluate the current goals and change our focus to support what is needed for our mission.
We all have a lot of work to do, only we will focus on the most important projects.
If you work slowly, you won't be hurt.
We don't plan to double the time after the pandemic is over.
You will not be expected to work extra hours to complete the work within the deadline, which is no longer realistic.
We acknowledge that the situation has changed, and where appropriate, we will work to set new goals and deadlines.
What's going on with the annual plan?
In order to be compatible with our new reality and daily working hours expectations, we also want to adjust the timeline for delivery of our 2020-2021 annual plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which allows more time to prepare budgets to give employees the opportunity to prioritize essential work, take care of themselves and take care of loved ones, as well as accept the demands of those who want to work on a reduced schedule for the next few weeks or need to do so.
This extension of the deadline greatly reduces the current plan's workload and the pressures throughout the organization.
We will submit our proposal to the board next week and we will update the delegates and teams on the next steps as soon as we receive confirmation.
Thank you to the AP team for your leadership in this regard.
The state of the office, contact and cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
But with a lot of caution, we hired a team of disinfectant cleaning staff to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used an anti-virus solution of hospital-friendly quality to sterilize each surface and lobby and the elevator banks that entered our floor.
The building is in charge of its own ministry, employing protocol user products that help protect their tenants.
We feel comfortable that the office will be ready when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork, which has exchanged its COVID-19 protocol with us and with all DC-based staff members.
Last week our DC office moved to a completely remote setup in line with the instructions given to San Francisco.
Some of our NYC-based colleagues know that we were also discussing leasing a place in Brooklyn.
Discussions are ongoing, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our long-distance colleagues know that it can be adjusted, and wanted to give you some advice:
Limit the length of the meeting to one or two hours.
If a longer session is required, consider how they can be divided into smaller portions over a few days.
Explain the meeting clearly, put a schedule and send the text materials in advance.
With tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate live collaboration and connection, default the video.
Keep a lead to facilitate each meeting, ask someone to observe questions in the chat and keep an eye on the speaker's list, and ask someone to write notes (or take notes collaboratively).
If you need a comfortable headset, send an email to Tech Support.
Make use of your snooze for the snooze.
Join the <0x23>remotes channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed work.
The HR management team is looking at webinar-based ergonomics guidelines to help increase the spread of distributed work across the foundation.
Last week we asked all community donors to cancel public events such as Editathon, funded by Wikimedia, until the WHO declares the pandemic to be over.
We inform them that we understand that our request for cancellations and other restrictions may make it impossible to complete their agreed grant activities and that no one will be penalized for delaying or correcting these goals.
In this coming week we will be inspiring additional guidance for Wikimania and other regional and topical community conferences.
There seems to be both depression and clarity, at the same time, from the entire global public community to the general attitude disorder, but at the same time, from Wikimedia and elsewhere, to the ability to focus on their own communities.
In the coming days, CRT is working to create a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a place for the public to monitor the impact and follow our contacts with them.
Keeping in touch with COVID-19-related issues
We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting on Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to share additional updates and answer your questions and spend some time connecting with each other.
In this situation, we are all united and we will help as much as we can.
You can continue to search for information from this email in the middle of the day, and find other essential information related to COVID-19 on Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages updated and all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular contact with workers currently living in significantly affected countries.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a major workstream or coverage challenge, or if you need help with anything else, please do not hesitate to contact and work with CRT.
We are here to help and coordinate as needed.
If you have a confidential or sensitive issue, please email HR International Global Operations Director Brian Judan.
None of these changes should be seen as a waste of our work and responsibility.
Rather, it is an acknowledgement that at this moment, our actions and responsibilities will probably have to adapt in a way that we have not done in the past.
We believe that these steps are necessary to support each other, so that we can continue to work, provide the support that our movement needs, and provide the services that the world depends on.
When the time comes, our planned work will wait for us.
Now is the time to support each other and create space for the important work that is going to come in the coming weeks and maybe even months.
We need your support to do this, and we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can stay healthy when needed.
Now, please - wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Catherine, CRT team (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Hyme V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S) and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Hayme V, Jenin U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby N.)
B'Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestinal cells (cell membranes).
ACE2 opposes the work of the corresponding angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang(1-7) making it a promising drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also serves as a gateway to cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-modifying enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metaloenzyme that is present on the surfaces of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein has an N-terminal peptide M2 domain and a C-terminal receptor renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein, in which the active space in the enzyme's action is undesirable on the surface of the lungs and other tissue cells.
The extraterrestrial domain of ACE2 is separated from the transambrane domain by another enzyme known as shaddes, and as a result the soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually released through the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is mainly associated with the membranes of the cells related to the pulmonary type II alviolas, small intestinal enterocytes, most organ artery and vein endothelial cells and the spinal chin muscle cells.
The expression ACE2 mRNA is also found in cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstems.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as the counterbalance of ACE.
ACE angiotensin I divides the hormone into vasoconstricting angiotensin II.
ACE2 separates the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenoylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into vasodilator angiotensin (1-7).
ACE2 can distinguish a few other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apeline, neurotense, dinarfin A and ghrelin.
ACE2 neutral amino acid transporter regulates the exchange of membranes of SLC6A19 and has been associated with heart disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main point of entry for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that is responsible for SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that is responsible for COVID-19).
More specifically, the spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 in the enzymatic domain of ACE2 binds to the surface of the cell resulting in endocytosis and the displacement of both viruses and enzymes into the endosomes within the cell.
This entry process also requires the Priming of S proteins by host serine protease TMPRSS2, its insulation is under current investigation as a potential cure. This has helped some to speculate that lowering ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infections.
However, a number of professional societies and regulatory bodies have recommended the continuation of evidence ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
"A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that ""compared with controls, the risk of pneumonia was significantly reduced by 34% with the use of ACE inhibitors."""
"Moreover, patients treated with ACE inhibitors, especially those with high-risk strokes and heart failure, also had a lower risk of developing pneumonia."
"The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a decrease in pneumonia-related mortality, although its results were less potent than the overall risk of pneumonia."""
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a novel therapy for acute lung damage and appeared to improve the pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation of the pig with signs of lipoplysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the start of work is in 30 minutes, also the duration of the effect is 24 hours.
From various boils, it seems that individuals who cannot tolerate the first-class renin-angiotensin system inhibitors or preventative (RAS inhibitors) or have an illness where the intake of angiotensin II is increased, can expect rhACE2 tests to be performed on the body. Symptoms of acute respiratory illness (acute respirator)
"B'CoVID-19 apps are mobile software applications designed to identify contacts in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e., the process of identifying individuals (""identity"") who are in contact with an infected person."
Numerous applications were developed or proposed with official government assistance in some areas and jurisdictions.
A number of infrastructures have been developed for the creation of communication detection apps.
Privacy concerns have been raised, especially regarding systems that operate on the basis of identifying the geographical location of app users.
The relatively disabled access options include the use of Bluetooth signals to log the user's catch-up on other cellphones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate the functionality of supporting such Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government has launched an app together with Alipay that allows citizens to check if they have had contact with people with COVID-19.
It is used across more than 200 Chinese cities. An app called TraceTogether is used in Singapore.
The app has been created by local information technology groups, it has been released as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia “Stop Corona!”, a Bluetooth-based app that has launched aimed to detect the manifestation of a potential infected person and provide a quick response to healthcare authorities.
The app has been developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
From April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
"On April 12, the government announced that the connection search app is in the advanced stage of development and will be available to work in a few weeks. Similar apps (""StopCovid"") are planned in Ireland and France."
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore’s TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia is planning to launch a geofencing app for COVID-19 disease-deficit patients living in Moscow to ensure they don’t leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor in the Department of Security Engineering at the University of Cambridge, lists a number of potential practical problems with app-based systems, including a lack of functionality if the results are positive and the app's acceptance is limited to a small fraction of the population.
"Addressing concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful ""coronavirus"" apps, Apple has set limits on which companies can only add coronavirus-related apps to its app store by limiting them to ""government"" or otherwise named entities."
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Those who advocate for privacy expressed their concern in the context of the implications of surveillance on the public using coronavirus apps, in particular, about whether the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be finished after the threat is gone.
Amnesty International and more than 100 organizations have issued a statement calling for a ban on such surveillance.
The company announced eight conditions regarding the government project:
"The supervisor must be ""legal, necessary and proportionate""."
There should be a Sunset section to increase monitoring and monitoring;
The use of data for the purposes of COVID-19 must be limited;
Data protection and anonymity must be protected and security must be demonstrated on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance was required to stop the spread of discrimination and marginalization;
The sharing of any data with a third party must be clarified in the law;
Citizens should have the right to protest against abuse and protection against abuse.
"All ""relevant stakeholders"", including public health experts and marginalized groups, will be required to participate. The German Cayce Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter Ohne Grenzen) (RSF) have issued a checklist."
The purpose of the proposed Google/Apple plan is to remove the traces from the operating systems of these devices and solve the problem of constant surveillance if they are no longer needed.
Some countries used surveillance on network-dependent locations instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download the app and the ability to avoid surveillance.
In Israel, network-based identification was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to unrefined location information have significant potential privacy issues.
However, all systems on the central server do not require access to personal location data; multiple privacy-protecting systems have been created that only use the central server for interoperability (see section below).
An appless system was used in South Korea to monitor contact.
Instead of using an assigned app, the system collected tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile device tracking data and transaction data on the card, and combined them to send notifications via text messages to potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to warn of possible contact, the government has made location information available to the public, with some things being approved due to the far-reaching changes in the data privacy law following the outbreak of MERS in that country.
This information is available to the public through many apps and websites. Some countries, including Germany, considered using both a centralized and privacy-protecting system.
As of April 6, 2020, the details have not yet been released.
Detecting privacy-protected communication with a real organ of research education that began at least 2013 is a well-established idea. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record closeness to another cellphone user.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that has both centralized and decentralized methods and is not a single code of conduct. Decentralized behavioral codes are decentralized privacy-protection approaches (DP-PPT/DP-3T), making the temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka contact numbers, CEN) and other contact information-sensitive (CENT), mobile contact identification.
In these protocols, identifiable personal information never leaves the device and occurs within all matching devices.
MIT Media Lab is developing the Privacy Group SafePaths, a platform for the use of privacy-protecting strategies when collecting and using location or route interaction data to monitor the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on a white paper titled ‘Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic’, which was published in March 2020. Another similar effort was made by Enigma MPC on the SafeTrace platform, the company that manufactures privacy technology at the MIT-Media platform.
SafeTrace employs secure hardware technologies to allow users to exchange sensitive location and health information with other users and authorities, without compromising the privacy of information.
On April 5, 2020, the Universal TCN Alliance was founded by some groups with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling universal interoperability to identify and warn apps, which are one of the key aspects of widespread adoption, including essentially the same procedures and broad-scale overlapping behavioral norms that were necessary.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it has a free-sourced BlueTrace protocol that is being used by its government app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, respectively, announced an initiative to find people who come in contact, which will protect privacy according to their claims, based on a mix of Bluetooth low-energy technology and privacy-protecting cryptography.
They have also published details of the key technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system plans to be available in three steps:
To enable governments to create privacy-protecting official apps to detect coronavirus, roll-out of tools
Integration of this functionality directly on iOS and Android: Google and Apple first distribute the system through the operating system update and then plan to solve the take-up and continuous surveillance problems by removing it in the same way if disaster breaks out later.
B'drug repositioning (also known as re-profiling, new-acting, or sedative medicine) is an approved drug that is primarily used to treat a disease or condition different from the disease it was originally created for.
It is a pathway to scientific research that is currently being followed for the development of safe and effective COVID-19 therapies.
Other research directions include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and convalescent plasma infection. SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 targeted proteins of drugs each with multiple ligand binding sites.
These binding sites analyze and provide a reasonable project to create effective antiviral drugs against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are Papine National Proteins, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, Helicase, S proteins, and ADP riboflavesphetase.
At Hussain, and others studied various candidate compounds that were optimized and analyzed in its pre-clinical studies for the similarity of the skeleton of candidates by most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a strong SARS-CoV-2 anti-drug to recommend clinical study design.
Chloroquine is a malaria-preventive drug that is also used against some auto-immune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that chloroquine and its associated hydroxychloroquine were among the four drugs to be studied as part of a clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the tests of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the state of New York would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA allowed the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA's clinical trial process and is only approved as an experimental treatment for patients under the EU who are hospitalized but are not able to participate in clinical trials.
"The CDC said that ""the use, dosage or durability of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection"" has not yet been proven."
"Doctors said they were using the drug ""because there is no other option""."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
A large-scale research is underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting an examination about the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
"Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to show Favipirabari ""clearly effective""."
In the middle of the 4 day period, 35 patients in Shenzhen tested negative, while 45 patients who did not receive it had a duration of 11 days.
In a study of 240 patients with pneumonia, conducted in Wuhan, half were given Faviparovir and half were given Umifenovir.
The Italian pharmaceutical agency reminded the public that the evidence existing in support of the drug is inadequate and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced it would buy drugs from Japan to store and the military would be used to deliver drugs to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has proposed to the Trump administration about the purchase of drugs. The drug may be less effective in terms of severity of illness where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or those who are trying to conceive.
"A combination of antiviral drugs of Lopinavir and Ritonavir was concluded by a study of Lopinavir/Retonavir (Kaletra) that ""no benefit could be observed."""
Medications were planned to prevent HIV from replication by binding to the protege.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to change drugs to find a compound that will bond with the protease of SARS-CoV-2. There has been criticism among scientific societies about the use of resources to change the purpose of drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO includes Lopinavir/Retonavir in the international mutual support test.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus-related diseases and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that Remdesivir had antiviral activity in-vitro against multiple phylo-, pneumo-, paramixo- and corona-virus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is the development of immunity through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and infections.
A few preliminary pre-trial studies indicate that Remdesivir may have high genetic barriers to resistance. Several clinical trials are ongoing, including two trials conducted by the Cleveland University Hospital; one for people with moderate illness and the other for people with extra severe illness.
There are three ongoing clinical trials of vitamin C for hospitalization and varicose veins for severely ill people with COVID-19; two controlled placebos (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
New York State began trial for antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning to conduct a clinical trial for the corticosteroid taken by respiration in Teijin Alvesko (cyclosanide), to treat pre-monitored patients with the novel coronavirus.
A type of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is being tested in Denmark, Germany, and Austria with 200 patients admitted to hospitals, in order to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchisin in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients suffering from mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, looked at 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and experienced mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or who do not have an effective contraceptive method, are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, prompting the Italian Medicine Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multi-disciplinary study on the use of anoxaperin sodium in preventive and sedative medicine in 300 patients was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientific attention has been focused on reproducing approved anti-poisoning drugs that were developed for previous outbreaks such as MERS, SARS and West Nile viruses.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for COVID-19 treatment in accordance with China's 7th edition guidelines.
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for COVID-19 treatment as per Chinese 7th edition guidelines
Some antibiotics that have been identified as potentially useful for new purposes as a treatment for COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (Anti-IL-6 receptor): Approved by China.
Testing is also underway in Italy and China. See also Tocilizumab <0x23>COVID19.
The B'A COVID-19 vaccine is a planned vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, multiple efforts are in progress to produce such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was not expecting the effective virus, the SARS-CoV-2 defense vaccine, to be available in less than 18 months.
In April, there were five vaccine candidates in the Phase I safety study.
COVID-19 was detected in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, leading to substantial investment and research activities to produce a vaccine.
Many companies are using published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, it was said that the condition of the CEPI initiative to produce the vaccine is speed, production capacity, large-scale application, and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were working for research and development in early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform goals that have progressed in Phase I security studies include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Virus-causing carriers (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Cancino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As CEPI scientists reported in April, a total of 115 vaccinated individuals are in the early stages of development, out of which 78 have been confirmed as active projects (79 according to the Milken Institute) and 37 others have been reported, but all of these are derived from publicly published data (estimated as being planned).
The Phase I-II test conducts preliminary safety and immunity tests and is usually performed at random, placebo-controlled and multiple sites when determining a more precise, effective dose.
Phase III trials, including vaccine testing effectiveness and control groups for disease prevention, usually involve more participants, while on the other hand, monitoring adverse effects on favorable drug levels.
"From 79 vaccine candidates for active development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 have not yet been evaluated (still under ""prenatal"" research)."
Around January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland in Australia announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecular-binding vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune response.
Around the 24th of January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-Intervack) of the University of Saskatchewan announced that it would begin work on a vaccine with the goal of starting testing in the human body in 2021.
The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was announced on 26 January 2020 and on 28 January 2020 at the University of Hong Kong.

the development and production of a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans to conduct preclinical tests and phase I clinical trials by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that it was working on 11 isolates and that it would take at least a year and a half to two years to develop a vaccine even at a fast pace.
On March 12, 2020, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of coronavirus-like molecules with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research in Medicago.
The vaccine candidate laboratory is under research to test the human body in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had proposed to give Curivoc "a large amount of money" to get exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine, against which the German government protested.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer jointly announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to produce the mRNA-based vaccine.
mRNA-based vaccine candidate BNT162, which is currently in pre-clinical testing, and clinical trials are expected to begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020, in Italy, an Italian biotech company called Takis Biotech announced that they would have the results of pre-clinical testing in April 2020 and that their final vaccine candidate could be tested in the human body in fall.
On 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemiological Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) in France announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a research association for COVID-19 vaccines, which included the Total Pasteur of the University of Pistur, The Bioscience of Vienna.
CEPI's other investment partners are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had started testing six different vaccine candidates on animals.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were preparing a self-enhancing RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was made within 14 days of receiving the order from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced C$275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical defense against COVID-19, including numerous vaccine candidates at Canadian institutions and universities such as the University of Medicago and Saskatchewan Initiative.
"At the same time, the Canadian government specifically announced C$192 million for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, and several new vaccines also have plans to establish a national ""vaccine bank"" that can be used if any other coronavirus outbreak occurs."
"On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on testing a potential COVID-19 vaccine called PittCoVacc on mice, stating that ""SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines administered by MNA are potent antigen-specific antibody reactions [in mice] after the start of the week."
On April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy in Canada announced plans for a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a potential nasal spray.
The DNA will be designed using bacteriophages to replicate inside the human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three universities created a unified resource to gain access to supercomputers from IBM, a combination of cloud computing resources by Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can be beneficial beyond the diseases that prevent them.
Efforts are being made to register 4,170 health care workers for an additional invasive trial in Australia.
There is a possibility that the vaccines under development will not be safe or effective.
Initial studies of COVID-19-specific animal models such as ACE2-transgenic rats, other animals in the laboratory and mammals that are not humans indicate the need for biosafety-level 3 control levels and international coordination to ensure quality protection procedures for the survival of the virus.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no cure or protective vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective for humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of novel vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS was a priority for governments and public health organizations around the world. There is no proven vaccine against MERS.
When the MERS outbreak occurred, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful template for preparing vaccines and vaccines against a MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was a (DNA-based) MERS vaccine that had completed the first clinical trials in humans and there are three more ongoing, all of which are viral-vector vaccines, two adenoviral-vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA-Vac.
Social media posts have propagated the theory of a conspiracy that claimed that the virus behind COVID-19 was known and a vaccine was already available.
The patents mentioned in various social media posts are related to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other types of coronavirus, such as SARS coronavirus.
B'Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to the virus to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
Although mild symptoms appear in most cases, in some cases their progress may lead to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported across 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus spreads to humans through tiny spit particles caused by coughing, sneezing or talking during initial close contact.
When spitting particles are generated during exhalation, they usually fall on the ground or above the surface rather than spread over long distances.
People can also get infected by touching their eyes, nose or mouth after touching contaminated surfaces.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious within the first three days of the onset of symptoms, although it is likely to spread before symptoms appear and at a later stage of the disease. The ideal method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from the nasopharyngeal swab.
People who are suspected of being infected with the virus and their caregivers are advised to wear masks.
The recommendations for the use of masks in the general public vary, with some authorities recommending against the use of them, some suggesting the use of them, and others requiring the use of them.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries across all six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may be symptomless or have symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Urgent symptoms include shortness of breath, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty waking up, and mouth or lip cramps; immediate medical care is advised if these symptoms are present.
Relatively less common, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, watering with the nose, or sore throat may be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea have been observed with a variation of percentages.
In China, some cases were initially seen only with chest pains and chest pains.
In some cases, the disease can lead to pneumonia, multi-angle defects, and death.
This is known as the opening stage of the germ.
Infectious episodes of COVID-19 usually last five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who are showing symptoms can be seen within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that symptoms do not appear in all of those infected.
The role of these symptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known, but preliminary evidence suggests they may have a role to play in the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people with no symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, according to a report from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), which states that 20% of all confirmed cases were symptomatic while in the hospital.
On April 1, China's National Health Commission began to include symptomatic cases among its daily cases; 130 of the 166 infections that day (78%) were symptomatic during testing.
Both saliva and saliva can carry a large number of viruses.
It's easier to talk than to talk normally.
A study in Singapore found that small droplets caused by a mouthless cover can spread up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not normally airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has indicated that bioarosol infection may be possible, and the air collector kept in the hallway outside the human house gave a positive sample of the viral RNA.
Some medical methods, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary rejuvenation (CPR), can lead to airborne respiration.
Although there are concerns that it may spread through malls, this risk is considered low. The virus is most likely to be touched if symptoms appear in humans; it may be possible to spread before symptoms become clear, but the risk is low.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, but one person usually infects two to three people. The virus survives on surfaces for several hours to days.
In particular, up to a day on the cardboard, the virus was found to be detectable in plastics (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) for three days and in 99% copper for four hours.
It varies depending on temperature and humidity.
Soap and detergent can also be effective when used correctly; saline products break down the fatty protection layer of the virus, inactivate it, and release them from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a sterilization-related disinfectant) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken between two days after the start of hospitalization.
The first sample of five of the six patients showed the most full of the virus, and the second day of testing of the sixth showed the most full of the virus.
Civic Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a team of people suffering from acute respiratory illness in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in coronaviruses related to nature.
The virus dies in domestic soap outside the human body, which cracks its protective bubbles. SARS-CoV-2 has a close relationship with the original SARS-CoV.
Lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus enters the host cells through the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) found in the lung type II alveolar cells.
"The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called ""spike"" (peplomer) to connect with ACE2 to enter the host cell."
In 12% of infected people admitted to hospitals in Wuhan, China, acute cardiac injury was reported and it is more frequent in severe diseases.
Cardiovascular symptoms are higher due to systemic inflammatory reactions and immune system disorders during the development of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may also be related to the heart's ACE2 receptors.
ACE2 receptors go faster to the heart and are involved in heart function.
In ICU patients with COVID-19 infection, thromboembolism (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) have been observed and may be associated with weakened prognosis. The body-test of people who die in COVID-19 has been shown to be affected by the inflammatory alveolar (diffuse alveolar intrase, DAAD) and the affected alveolar.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has a tendency to lead to respiratory tract connective epithelial cells -ACE2, acute COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hyperinflation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-Secreting T-cells in COVID-19 patients have been found to be associated with inflammatory IL-6-discharged monosite and severe lung pathology recurrence (recruitment).
Lymphocyte infiltrate has been reported in the examination of the body.
The WHO has released a number of testing protocols for the disease.
The standard method of testing uses reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) in real time.
The test is usually done in respiratory samples obtained by the nephrogenic swab; however, nasal swab or spit samples can also be used.
Results are usually seen in a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be done, but these require two blood samples to be taken at a two-week interval, and the results have a low immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to distinguish strains of the coronavirus and release genetic sequences so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infections by the virus.
On April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which could detect active infections and whether a person had been infected in the past) were in preparation for the development, but have not yet been widely used.
The Chinese experience in the field of testing has shown only 60 to 70% accuracy.
On 21 March 2020, the FDA in the United States approved the first spatial hemorrhoid testing for use at the end of that month. The guidelines for diagnosis published by the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University recommends methods for detection of infection based on clinical features and pandemic risk.
Bidirectional, multilobber ground-glass opaqueness, including an endemic, asymmetric and backward distribution, is common in primary infections.
Depending on the progression of the disease, subplural predominance, irregular paving (the septal thickening of lobular by filling the variable alveolar) and amalgamation can be seen.
There is very little information available about the pathophysiology and microscopic lesions of COVID-19.
The main pathological facts of the post mortem investigation are:
Macroscopy: Pleurisy, Pericarditis, Long Consolidation (Catching of the lungs) and Pulmonary Shoeth
There are four types of viral pneumonia:
Light Pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large-scale atypical pneumocytes, inland inflammation and multinucleated granular cell formation with lymphocyte infiltration
Severe pneumonia: Damaged scattered alveolar (DAD) with scattered alveolar emitters.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory illness syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Pneumonia Sarano: the organization of alveolar excretions and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: Diffused intravascular clotting (DIC); Leukoarthroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include sitting at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, and practicing appropriate hygiene related to breathing and non-touching of eyes, nose or mouth with soap and water.
The CDC recommends covering the face and nose with tissues during coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inner side of the elbow if no tissue is found.
Proper hand hygiene is encouraged after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC recommends using cloth face coverings in public to limit transmission by symptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies are designed to reduce exposure to people infected with large scale groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and canceling large gatherings.
Instructions for maintaining distances also include that people will stay at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) away.
"There is no known drug that is effective in preventing COVID-19. Since no vaccine is expected until 2021, the key part of COVID-19 control is trying to reduce epidemic peaks, known as ""flattening the curve""."
The CDC also advises people to wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or if the hands are visible dirt, before eating and after sneezing, coughing or sneezing.
It also recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol only when soap and water is not available. In places where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
The activity of antimicrobials in these preparations is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
"Hydrogen peroxide is used to remove bacterial spores in alcohol; it is ""not an active substance for hand antiseptics""."
Glycerol is added as a herbicide.
People are driven by supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and helping other affected serious organs.
The CDC recommends that people who are suspected of carrying the virus should wear a mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to solve the problem of respiratory dysfunction, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to improve immunity.
Assistive treatment may be effective for people with symptoms similar to those with symptoms in the early stages of infection. The WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have released recommendations to take care of people with COVID-19 who are hospitalized.
Intensivists and pulmonologists in the United States have organized the medical recommendations of various organizations to the free resource, IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For the symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen for initial use.
Caution must be taken to reduce the risk of virus infection, especially in the healthcare environment when procedures such as intubation or hand ventilation are performed that can create airborne particles.
For healthcare professionals serving people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends keeping the man in an airborne infection isolation room (Airborne Infection Isolation Room, AIIR) in addition to using evidence warning, touch alerts and airborne warnings. The CDC has described the instructions for using personal protective equipment (PPE) during the global pandemic.
The recommended equipments are: PPE gowns, respirators or facemasks, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, the respirator (instead of facemasks) is recommended.
The N95 respirator is approved for industrial environment but the FDA has approved masks for use under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust but are not guaranteed for label-specific use against specific biological elements.
If masks are not available, the CDC recommends using homemade masks as a last resort.
Most patients do not have severe COVID-19 enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but some patients are more severe.
Intubation can be avoided with a high-flow nasal cannula or bi-level positive airway pressure, with some evidence that the type of respiratory support is being actively studied for people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure for hospitalizations.
It is not known whether any of these two will lead to the same benefit for those who are seriously ill.
Some doctors choose to keep it through when invasive mechanical ventilation is available because this technique limits the spread of airborne particles compared to the high-flow nasal cannula. Severe cases are most common in older adults (those over 60 and especially those over 80).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, which limits the ability of health management to deal with the sudden increase in the number of serious COVID-19 cases that require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% had been admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical support for ventilation, and 1.4% had died.
In China, about 30% of people with COVID-19 in hospitals are finally admitted to the ICU.
In COVID-19, acute respiratory illness syndrome (ARDS) develops and mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as oxygenation becomes increasingly inconvenient.
Pressure control mode and high PEEP enabled ventilators are needed to maximize oxygen distribution, on the other hand ventilators need to reduce the associated lung injury and the risk of pneumothorax.
High levels of PEEP can not be found in old ventilators.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020 and clinical trials of several antiviral drugs are underway.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
While it may take until 2021 to develop new drugs, a number of drugs that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in advanced trials.
Antiviral drugs can be tested in people with severe diseases.
WHO’s recommended volunteers will participate in a trial of potential medical effectiveness and safety. The FDA has granted temporary approval to Convalescent Plasma as an experimental treatment where the person’s life is in serious or immediate danger.
No clinical studies have been conducted to show that it is safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to combat the disease outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app is able to use surveillance data to identify 'near contact' and, consequently, the potential risk of infection.
Each user can check the status of the other three users.
The app not only recommends self-harm if possible, it also warns local health officials. Big data analytics, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to monitor people infected and people coming into contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to monitor the data on mobile phones of people who were suspected to have coronavirus.
The measures were taken to protect people who may have come in contact with infected citizens and to enforce quarantine.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared information on the unified phone location of the German Federal government agency Robert Kahn Institute to prevent the spread of the virus and for research purposes.
Russia has used facial recognition technology to identify the quarantine breaker.
"Italian regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said mobile phone operators told him ""40% of people are walking around anyway""."
The German government held a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Karti Kaljulaid also called for a global solution to the coronavirus outbreak.
Individuals may feel ill from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection themselves.
"The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, ""The increased social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic recession are a perfect disaster for harming people's mental health and well-being."""
The disease, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases such as a common cold, can progress very rarely or without any symptoms.
Smaller cases usually recover within two weeks, but it may take three to six weeks for those with serious or serious illnesses to recover.
Pregnant women may be at risk of severe infection with COVID-19 based on data from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, but there is a lack of information on COVID-19. COVID-19 in some humans can cause pneumonia and damage the lungs.
In most cases of severe cases, COVID-19 can cause a rapid increase in acute respiratory illness syndrome (ARDS), which can cause respiratory dysfunction, septic shock, or multi-angle dysfunction.
The complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clots, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
In 6% of those hospitalized with COVID-19, blood clotting abnormalities, especially an increase in prothrombin time, have been clarified, while abnormal kidney function has been seen in 4% of the group.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have seen an increase in transaminase.
According to the same report, the time between the onset of symptoms and death, including five hospitalizations, was ten days.
However, patients who were transferred to the ICU had a seven-day interval between hospitalization and death.
In a study of early cases, the interval between the initial symptoms and death was 14 days, with a full six to 41 days duration.
The National Health Commission of China (NHC) found that men had a 2.8% mortality rate while women had a 1.7% mortality rate.
Histopathological tests of the autopsy of lung samples show the damage to the dispersal alveolar, including the release of cellular fibromyalgia in both lungs.
Viral cytopathological changes were observed in the pneumococytopenia.
The image of the lungs is similar to acute respiratory illness syndrome (Acute Respiratory Disorder Syndrome, ARDS).
Heart damage was identified as an increase in cardiac arrest or troponin levels in 11.8% of deaths reported by China's National Health Commission.
According to U.S. March data, 89% of those hospitalized had pre-existing conditions. The socioeconomic status of a region and availability of medical resources could also affect mortality.
The mortality rate from this disease varies not only due to regional differences but also due to systemic difficulties.
Lower mortality rates of mild cases can be calculated in excess.
However, the actual fact is that death is the result of being infected in the past, which means that the current death rate is being underestimated.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 than non-smokers and about 2.4 times more likely to need or die from intensive care. Concerns have been raised about the long-term consequences of the disease.
The Hong Kong hospital authorities noted a 20% to 30% reduction in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung scans indicated organ damage.
This can also lead to post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether past infections provide effective and long-term immunity to people recovering from the disease.
The chances of immunity are very high based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but in those cases the recovery from COVID-19 has been reported after the positive test results of the coronavirus later in the day.
These cases are feared to be due to further deterioration of the permanent infection than the re-infection.
It is believed that the virus has natural and animal sources, through an increase in infection.
The actual source is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 was published in January 2020 in The Lancet, where the first date for the onset of symptoms was reported as December 1, 2019.
The early onset of symptoms was reported by official publications from the WHO on December 8, 2019.
A number of measures are usually used to determine the death rate.
These numbers vary by region, and are influenced by population characteristics such as the amount of testing, the quality of the healthcare system, the treatment options, the time cut since the initial outbreak, and the age, gender, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, the WHO specified the emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 to death due to SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed in the lab, and the number of deaths due to SARS-CoV-2 infection not confirmed in the lab was specified by the U07.2 code to indicate the death due to COVID-19, which was medically or epidemiologically transmitted.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the proportion of deaths and cases worldwide as of April 17, 2020 is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
The number varies by region. Other measures include case fatality rate (case fatality rate, CFR) that identifies the percentage of people who have died from the disease and infection fatality rate (infection fatality rate, IFR), which is the percentage of infected people (infectious and non-infected) who have died from the disease.
These figures do not have a specific timeline and follow a specific population from infection to the diagnosis of the disease.
Although antibodies are not produced in all infected people, the presence of antibodies can provide information about how many people have been infected.
The epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, Casiglyon DiAdda, is a small village of 4,600 people, where 80 people (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangetic, the disease spread through the carnival festival and spread among younger people, which causes relatively low death, and all COVID-19 deaths may not have been officially classified.
In addition, the German health system has not been affected.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of blood donors may have antibodies as assessed.
69 people (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate is different for men and women.
The mortality rate among men is higher in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, and the gap between men and women is in the 90s.
The death rate in China was 2.8 percent in men and 1.7 percent in women.
The exact causes of these gender-differences are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors can cause.
Gender-based immunological differences, the prevalence of smoking among women is relatively low and the development of co-morbidity in men at a younger age than women, such as high blood pressure may play a role in higher mortality rates in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected people were male and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were male.
Since April 2020, the U.S. government has not been monitoring gender-related data on COVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that viral illnesses such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS affect men and women differently.
Most health workers, especially nurses, are women and are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
"On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the disease would be officially named ""COVID-19""."
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means corona, VI is the virus, D is the disease, and 19 is when the outbreak was first identified: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid mentioning specific geographical locations (e.g., China), animal species or human groups, in line with international recommendations for the prevention of Kalimalapan. The virus that causes COVID-19 is named as Civir Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
"The WHO uses additional ""COVID-19 virus"" and ""virus responsible for COVID-19"" to connect to the public."
"Both disease and virus are commonly referred to as ""coronavirus""."
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as the coronavirus and the Wuhan coronavirus.
In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory diseases as a temporary name for viruses and diseases, in accordance with the 2015 guidelines regarding the use of virus and disease status.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on February 11, 2020.
Some digital manufacturers are printing health care components such as nettle swabs and ventilators due to power constraints in the ideal supply chain.
In one example, when a supplier of a ventilator valve in an Italian hospital is unable to deliver it within the required time frame, a local new company tested the manufacturer's product construction and produced the required 100 valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and rumors emerged about the origins, dimensions, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and spread quickly online.
It is believed that humans can spread the virus to other animals.
The study failed to find any evidence of replicating the virus between pigs, ducks and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines have been approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs for COVID-19 is ongoing by government agencies, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a "mutual support test" to assess the therapeutic effect of four existing antiviral compounds with the highest commitment to efficacy.
There is no vaccine, but several companies are actively making vaccine cadets.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are used by the ACE2 customer to enter human cells.
Three vaccines are being developed.
First, the researchers aim to create a complete virus vaccine.
Whether inactive or dead, the use of the virus is aimed at eliminating the immediate immune response of the human body to a new infection caused by COVID-19.
The second strategy is to develop a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study identified S-spice protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme customer.
The third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, innovative strategy for vaccine development).
Experimental vaccines need to be tested from one of these strategies for safety and efficacy. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
The virus that causes the disease is in the genetic code vaccine that does not harm to replicate it. Antibody-dependent growth has been indicated as a potential challenge to the development of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, but it is controversial.
More than 300 active clinical trials have been conducted since April 2020.
Seven trials were evaluating already approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Most of China's research is being done to use antiviral drugs for different purposes, and nine phase III tests on Remdesivir across different countries are scheduled to be reported by the end of April.
A dynamic review of the clinical development of COVID-19 vaccines and drug candidates was prepared in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19 including Remdesivir, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/Retonavir and Repinavir/Retinovir in combination with Interferon Beta.
There is experimental evidence of efficacy by Remdesivir in March 2020.
Clinical improvements have been observed in patients treated using experimental drugs of Remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are taking place in the United States, China, and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used for the treatment of malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 with preliminary results.
However, research needs to be reviewed.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, when recommending a dose of one gram of medicine per day, noted that twice the dose of this drug can be extremely dangerous and life-threatening.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of medical doctors treating people with COVID-19. Interferon, ribavirin or Umifenovir are also included in the Chinese 7th edition guidelines in terms of COVID-19.
Initial data indicates that high doses of ribavirin are needed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further vivo studies after low-density nebulization of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that preparing the primary spike protein by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for SARS-CoV-2 penetration through reciprocating with ACE2 receptors.
There are serious limitations to the study of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin that prevent the medical community from taking these therapies without further study. Oseltamivir SARS-CoV-2 in Vitro does not inhibit and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
In the next stage of severe COVID-19, cytokine catastrophes can be a complex situation.
Hydroxychloroquine has evidence that cytokine can have anti-inflammatory properties. Tosilizumab is included in China’s National Health Commission medical guidelines after completing a short study.
After seeing positive results in people with severe diseases, it is going through phase 2 non-invasive testing at the national level in Italy.
Blood tests in combination with serum ferritin to identify cytokine disorders means preventing the progression of the disease, which is thought to be the cause of the death of some infected people.
In 2017, CAR T cell therapy was approved by the FDA of interleukin-6 receptor antagonists based on a past-associated case study to treat cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause.
To date, there is no unrivaled, controlled evidence that Tosilizumab is effective treatment for CRS.
Those who have recovered from COVID-19 are being investigated as a non-vaccinated method of inactivated inoculation of refined and dense antibodies produced by the immune system.
This technique was tested for SARS with undesirable results.
Viral inactivation is the expected process of special procedures through which passive antibody therapy can mediate defenses against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other processes such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other types of inactive antibody therapy, for example, the use of produced monoclonal antibodies, are on the way to development.
The production of the convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid portion of the blood taken from the recovered patients, and this virus can be extended to the specific antibodies for rapid organization.
Coronavirus diseases, a class of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Central Hospital in Wuhan, died of COVID-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
