Members of the Welsh Assembly are worried about wearing their own “map-like”
Several members of the Assembly have expressed concern over the change in their designation to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
Due to this fear, the name of the Assembly has been proposed to be changed to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of various political parties have expressed concern over the change of name.
A member of the Labour party's assembly said his party was concerned that the new designation "matched the rhythm with the twp and pwp."
For readers outside of the Welsh: in the Welsh language, Twp means stupid and Pwp means mall.
A Pleading Assembly member said they were "not happy" as a team and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said the party was "open minded" to the name change, but noted that there was little difference in pronunciation between the MWP and the maize.
In this sense, the pronunciation of the letter W is similar to the pronunciation of the letter U in Yorkshire English.
The Constituent Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing legislation to initiate the name change process, said: “The final decision on what will be the details of the designation of the Assembly members must be taken by the members themselves.”
The Government of Wales Act, 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change their names.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public vote in which the proposal to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament received overwhelming support.
Regarding the designation of members of the Constituent Assembly, the Commission is supporting the Welsh Parliament Member or WMP, but in public opinion the MWP has the most support.
Apparently, the Assembly members are suggesting different options, but it will be difficult for the presiding officer, Elin Jones, to reach a consensus, to submit the draft of the legislation within a few weeks.
This provision of reform will include changes in the functioning of the Assembly, including the disqualification of the members of the Assembly and the design of the committee system.
After the debate over this provision, the members of the Assembly will have the opportunity to cast their final vote on what their designation should be.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to decide whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was made to avoid a decades-long conflict with neighboring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that its northern neighbor's name symbolizes the establishment of claims over its territory and has repeatedly objected to the country's application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Georg Ivanov, who is opposed to a referendum on a name change, said he would reject the referendum.
Despite the fact that supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Joran Zaev, feel that the change of name is only a step necessary to join the European Union and NATO.
St. Martin's fruit bells are silent as the churches of Charlemagne Harlem continue to smoke.
"The older people I spoke to said that historically there was one church and a bar in every corner," Mr Adams said.
"There's nothing today."
He said it was clear that the building had been demolished.
Today, "social media" is used in a variety of ways.
"The toilets are no longer the living room of the area where everyone goes on a regular basis."
In the case of the church of Jericho, he worried that the money sold out of the property would not last as long as the leaders thought, “And be it today or tomorrow, go back to where they started.”
He also said that apartment buildings and condominiums could be built in place of the church where people would live who would not help the rest of the churches in the area.
“Most of the people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and so they will accelerate the day these churches are closed because most of the people who live in these condominiums are less likely to become church members.”
Both churches were founded by the white congregation before the town became a black-dominated city of Harlem – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and a decade later St. Martins.
The Moul Whiteng Methodist congregation left the church in 1930.
Nearby a black congregation of worshipers took ownership of the building.
Under Rev. John Howard Johnson, a black congregation led by St. Martins, who led a boycott against retailers on A Hundred and Twenty Fifth Street for refusing to provide jobs and promote black workers – a major road for shopping in Harlem.
The building was badly damaged in a fire accident in 1939, but Father Johnson's Parish residents planned to restore it when they arranged for the construction of the carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin proudly named Carillon as "the bell of the poor man."
The expert who played Carillon in July called it something different: “an historic asset” and “an irreplaceable historical musical instrument.”
Tiffany Nyong, a specialist at the University of Michigan, also said that it is the orthodox carolina of the Earth serving a black dwarf, which is Bajan deonio A. Lind, who was appointed 18 years ago to play the larger carrillon of the Riverside Church.
Mr. Marriott said the St. Martins did not replace him.
What has happened in St. Martins over the past few months is a complex incident of architects and contractors appointed by the general church leaders or Episcopal Dioceses.
Vestry – the governing body of Paris, which consists of general leaders – expressed their concern in July that they thought Dioscis would “transfer costs” of the Vestree, although Vestry was not involved in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by Diocese.
Some members of the Parish Council have complained of a lack of transparency in the work of Diocese.
In California, a 13-year-old has been injured in a shark attack after he drowned in California.
A 13-year-old boy was injured in a shark attack on Saturday after he drowned on the first day of the Galda shrimp season, officials said.
The attack took place before 7 a.m. on Bikinis Beach near the NCinitas.
Chad Hamel told San Diego's KSWB TV he heard the boy screaming for help when he drowned with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning, pedaling there and helping a group of people get him out of the water.
Hamill said he initially thought the boy was pretending to be happy to catch a dirt ring, but then "understand that the boy was screaming, 'Kiss me!'"
“He bites me!”
"He broke his arm," Hamel said, reaching for the boy.
"I shout for everyone to get up from the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hamel.
The boy was airlifted to the Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The species of the attacker shark is not known.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles told the news briefing that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was not identified as a dangerous species.
Jacqueline also said that the victim suffered a serious injury to the upper part of her thigh.
Officials have banned beach access for 48 hours, from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Soami in Nsinitus, for investigation and security reasons.
Zack Giles said there were more than 135 shark species in the area, most of which are not dangerous.
Sansboris is planning to enter the UK market.
The company is set to compete with the likes of Sansbury's Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams in the business of shops, decorated with cosmetics like department stores and with specialist support staff.
As part of a strong effort to enter the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion retail market, these large retailing islands will be launched in 11 stores across the country and will be launched in other stores if proven successful. The UK’s retail market is growing as the fashion and home decor market falls.
This investment is coming as supermarkets are once again looking for new ways to fill shelves filled with TVs, microwaves and home furnishings.
The company said it would double its sales to 3,000 products, including Revlon, Easy, Tweezersman and Dr. Poe for the first time.
The already existing cosmetic ranges such as Lockheed Loreel, Mebelin, and Burts Beige will get more space, with separate spaces for brands like Boots.
The supermarket is rolling out its boutique makeup range so that most of the products are vegan friendly – which has become very popular among young buyers.
In addition, Perfume Vendor The Fragrance Shop will conduct a discounted product distribution test at two Sansburys stores, the first of which was launched last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will be launched later this year at Sally Oak in Birmingham.
Shopping online and buying small quantities of food at local grocery stores means supermarkets have to put in extra effort for buyer gatherings.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sinsburys, said that the outlets should look like a department store as the supermarket chain is competing with discount stores like Aldi and Leadl, and it will have more services and food-non-products.
The company claims to have set up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and opened a few Habitats, which has increased the sales of groceries and made the acquisition more profitable since the acquisition of Argos and Habitats chain two years ago.
Efforts to renovate the supermarket and dispose of the pharmacy department have failed.

The new strategy comes after the company sold 281 of its stores to Lloyd's Pharmacy's owner Celcio.
According to the company, Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding a luxury range of skincare brands, including La Roche Pozze and Vishi in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix, commercial director of Sensboris, said: “We have changed the rice-fields of our islands to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in hiring specially trained staff who will be present to advise.
Our brand range has been designed to meet all kinds of needs and due to the attractive environment and convenient location, we have now become a reliable appliance destination that will challenge the old methods of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'Agnishirma' for withdrawing Willowy's <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
TV presenter Holly Willowby Marks & Spencer and Peter Jones angered for canceling deals with the lifestyle brand of Peter Jones, star of the Dragons Den, to focus on his new contract with ITV.
Willow doesn't have time for their home furnishings and companion brand trolleys.
The business of this pair is compared to the Gyneth Paltrow's Gup brand.
In the morning, the 37-year-old announced his departure on Instagram.
Holly Willowby is angry with Dan’s star Peter Jones by withdrawing from their attractive lifestyle brand business at the last minute – aimed at focusing on his new Bumper deal with Marx & Spencer and ITV.
Jones became "a firebrand" when on Tuesday, in a meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, the TV's golden girl admitted that she had no time for her new deal - worth up to 1.5 million pounds - due to their household goods and subsidiary brand trolleys.
The business was compared to Gyneth Paltrow's Gup brand and was expected to double Willow's <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
After announcing his departure from the trolley on Instagram, Willowby, 37, Jones left Britain on a jet plane for his holiday home.
A source told TOI: "Truley has been at the top of the Halli's priority list so far.
It was part of his long-term future plan that met his economic needs for decades to come.
He was surprised by the decision to withdraw his resignation.
No one could believe that the incident took place on Tuesday, the project was supposed to be launched soon.
Marlowe's headquarters has a warehouse filling product that is ready for sale."
Experts believe that the company's departure, which is currently one of Britain's most trusted stars, could result in the loss of millions of pounds as they have already invested heavily in products ranging from cushions to candles, clothing and household items, and a possible delay in its inauguration would add to this loss.
This can lead to the termination of a long-standing friendship.
Willowby, the mother of three children, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Cap, for over a decade.
Willoughby started the trolley with Cap in 2016 and joined Jones, 52, as president in March 2016.
The couple is on holiday together and Jones owns 40 per cent stake in Baldwin's TV production firm.
Willowby will be the brand ambassador of M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of the celebrity event at ITV's I Am.
A source close to Joomla Jones said last night: "We will not comment on his business dealings."
It's a complicated conversation, and then we fall in love."
He joked that after expressing a positive attitude towards the North Korean leader and making a comment that some would consider "non-presidential".
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his "newspaper" voice.
"I didn't give up."
He said Kim was keen to meet for the second time after their initial meeting in Singapore in June. Trump claimed their first meeting was a huge step towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
Nuclear disarmament talks have come to a halt.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that there was no "relevant response" from the United States to North Korea's previous disarmament measures.
However, he said the United States has imposed a ban on the use of force.
During his speech at the rally, Trump expressed a more positive outlook.
"We are in a good position with North Korea," he said.
"We were at war with North Korea.
It could have killed millions of people.
We have a good relationship now."
He claims his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results – which has dragged the end of the rocket testing, helped free the prisoners and bring the rest of the American workers back home.
He and his family have been supportive of his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to behave in a presidential manner, but instead of waiting outside 10,000 people in this crowded area, there would have been only 200 people standing here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
An earthquake and tsunami devastated an island in Indonesia, killing hundreds of people.
After the quake, for example, foreign private companies were told they did not need help.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population was displaced, no national disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have very clearly stated that they are not requesting international cooperation, so the issue is challenging," said Ms. Sambang.
Although Chowk is gathering a team to go to Save the Children's Palu, it's not yet certain whether foreign workers will be able to work on the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether foreign agencies would be given the opportunity to participate in relief operations.
Despite the frequent earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is unprepared to deal with nature's fury.
Although Tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, other coastal areas have seen shelters.
Despite the warning, the apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, probably had an impact on life losses.
Traveling to many islands in Indonesia is challenging even when the weather is very good.
Natural disasters make the communication system more vulnerable.
A ship is going to the hospital in Lombok to nurse the victims, but it will take at least three days for the ship to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo put Indonesia's development of the hegemonic infrastructure at the center of his election campaign and he invested huge sums of money in the construction of roads and railways.
But the lack of investment before the next year's re-election has left Mr. Jokore's government in a quandary.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from Indonesia's long-standing communal tensions, where the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative lifestyle of their religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and more than 10,000 were left homeless in the riots between Christian Christians and Muslims. Two groups clashed on the streets with rioters, arrows and other rough weapons.
View Full Version: Liverpool's Daniel Starz's goal in the match against Chelsea
On Saturday, Daniel Starz saved Liverpool from a 89-minute loss to Chelsea in the Premier League at Stamford Bridge in London.
Jardan Shakiri received his pass while he was 30 metres away from the famous Chelsea goalpost and his team was 1-0 behind.
He first took the ball to the left and then took a shot towards the far post.
The shot moves to the right corner of the net at the top of the box.
At the end of the day, the ball crossed the jumper Kepa Arizabalaga and entered the net.
"It's important to get to the right position to catch the ball in time, because players like Shak always stretch the ball as much as possible before, so I was trying to give myself as much time as possible," Starz told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I'll give Kante a hug as I see him coming forward and don't think too much of a goal shot."
In the 25th minute of the game, Belgian star Aden Hazard scored to lead the half-time Chelsea 1-0.
The blues striker passed on to Mateo Kovacic, then ran from the midfield and entered Liverpool's haf.
Kovacic went ahead with the ball in the midfield.
Later, he gave Hazard a beautiful ball in the box at the Defence Chier in Liverpool.
Milwaukee lost the Hazard defense players in the race and reached the goal with a shot to the left of the net on the far post.
On Wednesday at 3pm, Napoli will face Napoli in the group stage of the Liverpool Champions League in Stadio San Paulo, Naples, Italy.
They will face Videoton at the Chelsea UEFA Europa League in London at 3pm on Thursday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832.
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster management agency said Sunday morning.
Many people are said to have been trapped in the rubble of the building that collapsed on the magnitude 7.5 earthquake last Friday. The quake struck and caused 20 feet of waterlogging, the company’s spokesman Sutopo Purouo Nugraro said at a conciliation conference.
The town of Palu, of 380,000 people, is filled with the ruins of the ruined buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of killing a woman in a knife attack.
A murder investigation has been launched this morning after the body of a woman was found in Burkina Faso.
The body of a 44-year-old woman who was stabbed to death was found at 755 am at Grayson Moose on John Street this morning, a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have invited people in the area to inform them if they see or hear anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I appeal to anyone around John Street in Berkenhead to contact us if the suspect sees or hears anything.
I appeal to everyone, especially the taxi drivers, who may have any footage on their dash cameras, to contact us because they may have essential information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the victim was a resident of Berkenhead and her body was found inside a house.
Friends, who think this woman is known to them, arrived at the scene this morning and asked where the body of the woman was found.
The investigation is ongoing and police said they were trying to inform the woman's relatives.
When a taxi driver in a nearby Grayson mound tried to enter his flat, police told him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was shocked to hear about the incident.
Residents of the building are told that it will take several hours to allow them to enter.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman was present at the scene crying.
He said: “It’s very sad.
Two police vans were inside the barricade at 2 p.m. and another was outside the barricade.
A group of police officers were inspecting the blocks of flats inside the barracks.
If anyone has any information, he has been requested to send a direct message directly to <0x40>MerPolCC or call 101 or anonymously on Crimestoppers on 0800 55511, on 30 September, log 247.
A new twist in the controversy surrounding the Chromwell statue of Parliament's Parliament is the rewrite of history.
The statue will be removed after the Taliban's destruction of many of England's cultural and religious monuments in the hands of its radical followers.
But the Cromwell Society has notified Mr. Crick's advice as "intelligent" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Colosseum Chromium Society, said: "In the current controversy over the removal of the statue, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell, set outside Westminster Palace, would become the target.
The act of destroying iconoclasm or patterns during the English Civil War was not performed by or under the command of Cromwell.
The false chromowell statue will be demolished in the course of its predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The extraordinary statue of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thornicroft, is a reflection of the opinion of the 19th century and part of a historical character that many consider worthy of celebration.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people consider Chromewell to be the protector of Parliament in the face of external pressure, in his case, against the pressure of the monarchy - which is now less people's opinion - but many in the 19th century had opinions.
But whether or not it is a perfect picture of that time is part of the ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th century conflict has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Chromewell is a familiar character who has represented a party to this division.
His achievements as a Lord Protector deserve to be celebrated and remembered."
The dog was killed by a Chinese farmer.
According to local media reports, a pig has been attacked and killed by a farmer in a market in southwest China.
The man, identified only by his genus "Yuan," was found near a pig stall in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig herd in Shining, Qinghai Province, China, was preparing to vaccinate pigs at a pig farm.
According to the complaint, he along with his Fupato brother came to the market on Wednesday for the sale of 15 pigs from the nearby Yunnan province.
The next morning, his stepbrother found him dead and found the door of a pig's ashtab next to him open.
He said that there was a large male pig in the Astabal that had blood on his face.
A forensic examination confirmed that the pig weighing 550 pounds had attacked the farmer and killed him, the report said.
"Two of my uncle's legs were bleeding and bruised," said Fupato brother, who has been identified as his surname "U," citing Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The man who killed the pig is not the man or his step-brother.
A manager at Bazaar Bazar told the Evening News that police were collecting the firewood at the scene and the pig was kept in isolation so that it could not attack anyone else.
Yuan's family and market authorities are in talks to determine the amount of compensation for his death.
Although rare, it has happened before the attack of pigs.
In 2016, a woman and her husband attacked a pig on their farm in Massachusetts, injuring the man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig, Exxon Welsh, pushed the farmer into his tractor until his wife came and frightened the pig and drove him away.
A farmer in Manitoba told CBC News in 2012 that pigs are not usually aggressive but can act as a "trigger or stimulant" to taste blood.
"They're just messing around."
They are small, very interested animals, but they don't try to hurt anyone.
But you have to work hard on them," he said.
The remainder of the Harkin roser will cause heavy rains throughout the southwestern United States.
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening the power of the cyclone during its run over colder waters in the northern coastal region of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will cause heavy rainfall in the northern part of Mexico and the southwestern part of the United States.
At 5 a.m. on Sunday morning, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with a speed of 85 miles per hour, and 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugene, Mexico.
We're heading north on Sunday.
On this side of the sea, a stream has begun to take shape in the Pacific and is heading east toward the West Coast of the United States. On Monday Rosa Baha will hit the California Peninsula as a seasonal storm and it will push deep tropical humidity northward towards the southwestern United States.
Rainfall of up to 10 inches will occur in parts of Mexico on Monday.
After that, it will be connected to the system that is moving towards deep tropical humidity and will create heavy rainfall in the coming days across the southern region.
Locally 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flash flooding or sudden flooding, the flow of debris and possible landslides in the desert.
Due to the deep tropical humidity of the deep, rainfall rates at various places can range from 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall is likely to be 2 to 4 inches over parts of southwestern Arizona, especially in most parts of the state.
Due to the scattered speed of the tropical monsoon, it is possible to reduce the flash flying and the situation very quickly.
Walking in the desert under the threat of tropical rain will be a very stupid thing to do.
Due to heavy rainfall, the canyon shots can turn into a terrible river and there will be strong winds with dust due to thunderstorms.
Due to the heavy rainfall, there will be heavy rainfall locally in various parts of the southern California coast.
Rainfall like rain can be up to half an inch, which can cause small debris streams on shiny roads.
This will be the region's first rainy season.
There may be some scattered tropical rains in Arizona from Sunday night and Monday morning, then the rains will increase and spread throughout the area from Monday night to Tuesday.
The heavy rainfall will reach the four corners on Tuesday and will continue till Wednesday.
In October, several extreme temperature changes can be seen in different regions of the United States as the Arctic cools down, but tropical temperatures are still quite warm.
This can sometimes lead to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
Sunday is an excellent example of the dramatic change in temperature in the central United States.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa is about 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the heat of summer will try to rise and spread again.
The United States is expected to warm up in October in much of the central and eastern part of the United States, with temperatures as high as 80 in areas ranging from the southern plains to the northeast.
On Tuesday, the temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees, about 10 degrees higher than the average temperature.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests that in the first half of October, temperatures in the eastern U.S. are likely to be much higher than the average temperature.
Brett Kavanaugh's hearing has been viewed by more than 20 million people.
The shocking testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and his alleged sexual assault by Christine Blazi Ford, which took place in the 1980s, saw more than 20 million viewers across six television networks on Thursday.
In this direction, political controversy continues, with broadcasters suspending regular shows due to last-minute surprises on Friday: an agreement made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI will have one week to investigate complaints.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was drunk at a high school party and tried to open his clothes.
Caucasian Cavana said in an emotional testimony that he was one hundred percent sure that the incident had not happened.
There is a possibility that more than 20.4 million people mentioned in Nielsen's report saw the activity on Friday.
The company was accounting for the average audience of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Other networks, which broadcast the program, were not available immediately with the number of viewers, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen and Nielsen usually face problems with the quality of the audience they see sitting in the office.
The number of spectators in the program was the same as the Play of Football or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose views were strongly supported by the show's presenters, attracted the highest number of viewers across all networks broadcasting the day-to-day hearing, with an average of 5.69 million, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS saw 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC saw 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million viewers, Nielsen said.
There was still interest after the hearing.
Frank was the main character in today's play.
After making the statement that the moderate Republican office he will vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on camera by CNN and CBS on Friday morning, when he boarded the elevator to reach the Judicial Committee hearing site and the protesters shouted for him.
He was sitting on the sidelines for a few minutes in front of the protesters, which aired live on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think Kevin is telling the truth to the country?"
She is told, "You have power when many women are helpless."
Flake said his office had made a statement and before the lift closed, said he had more to say at the committee's hearing.
Later, when the Judicial Committee votes to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate vote, all of the cable and broadcasting networks broadcast live.
But Fleck said he would vote on the condition that the FBI investigate charges against the nominee next week, which were requested by minority Democrats.
His conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Cun, has had a partial impact on the back of his acceptance of the comic flake.
After speaking to Kooky Kun, Fleck spoke to a few other senators and reached his decision.
Flake's decision was palpable, as it was clear that Republicans had no vote to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation in their hands.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation based on allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May has accused critics of playing “politics games” on Brexit.
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of playing "political games" about Britain's future and disregarding the nation's interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attended the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
In another interview printed next to his interview on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued to criticize May's so-called checkers plan for Brexit, saying that Britain and the European Union offered to collect each other's revenue "completely unreasonable."
Wed Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dayton Simpson over LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the shooting of 20-year-old basketball player Wade Sims.
Dayton Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed for second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses from the scene and said that Simpson's DNA was found in the glasses, CBS' associate WAFB said in a report.
After being interrogated by Parker Simpson, police said he had confessed to shooting Wade.
According to the report of The Advocate, his bail has been fixed at $350,000.
The post-mortem investigator's office in the East Baton Rouge area released a preliminary report on Friday, citing injuries caused by head and neck injuries as the cause of death.
The Department of Corrections is credited with assisting in the investigation of the Louisiana State Police's Escaped Accused Catching Task Force, State Police's Crime Lab, Southern University Police and residents of the area, which makes it possible to arrest the accused.
Chow LSU's athletic director Joe Alva thanked the law enforcement agency in the area for its "relentless efforts and pursuit of justice."
Mr. Simmons was 20 years old.
He grew up in a 6-foot 6-inch forward baton, where his father played basketball for Wayne and LSU.
Last season, he scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "deeply saddened" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
"It's always a matter of concern," Wade said.
Volcanic eruptions in Mexico City
Volcanic eruptions have reached the southern part of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Response Center warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to stay away from volcanic activity after increasing the mouth activation of volcanic eruptions and reaching the gas and steam output scale of 183 within 24 hours.
The center was observing multiple roars and tremors.
Images posted on social media showed the car's windshield plummeting in areas like Joachimilco in Mexico City.
Among geologists, there has been an increase in volcanic eruption activity since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake in September 2017 that shook Mexico, which is just 45 miles (72 km) south of the capital.
The volcano known as "Don Goo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday in a clash with the Riot police with pro-independence protesters, when they joined opposition protesters to celebrate the first year of the vote, centering on Catalonia's independence.
A group of masked separatists threw eggs, and coloured powders in the face of police barricades, causing black clouds on the streets, usually filled with tourist gatherings.
The next day, there was also a scuffle, which police used sticks to stop.
For several hours, the protesters chanted "I will not forget, I will not forgive" to the unification supporters who were chanting "Long live Spain."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries caused by the protests, local media reported.
Tensions have been brewing in the independence-affiliated area since Madrid declared the October 1 referendum illegal, celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The majority of voters voted in favour of independence, although the number of voters was low because the majority of the population opposed secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people were killed in clashes with police after they were prevented from voting during last year's general elections across the region.
Freedom fighters were on the streets all night on Friday to block demonstrations in support of the National Police.
Protesters continued their activities, but were forced to take to different streets.
The 68-year-old Norris Termis, a power worker who participated in the separatist protests along with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about Catalonia's independence.
Last year was one of the best years of our lives.
"I've seen the tears in my parents' eyes, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a significant but narrow victory in provincial elections last December, Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain their momentum where many of their well-known leaders are awaiting trial for voluntarily exiled or detained for their organization's role in the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Caucasian Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who is recording the protest in support of the police on her phone, said the dispute was created by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting worse day by day," he said.
One of the Catalan leaders who is not in pre-trial detention on Saturday, Oriole Junkeras, announced late last year that he would take part in next year's European Parliament elections.
"The best way to prevent the suppression and oppression of democratic values from the Spanish government is to stand as a candidate for the European elections," he said.
London: Man arrested after car collision with his house.
Three men, 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after they were repeatedly hit by a car at a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Balengaard Crescent at 19:30 Bangladesh time on Thursday.
Deputy Inspector Bob Bloomings said the gates and buildings were damaged.
At some point, the car may have been hit by a crossbow.
The men's team won 1-0 against the Rangers in the men's doubles.
Dolly Menger scored his first goal for Livingston.
Stalling the Livingston Rangers, he gave Steven Gerrard his second defeat in 18 games as director of the Ebrox Club.
Dolly Menger made the gap as Gary Holt's team equalised with the Hibernians with a second goal.
As a result, Gerard's team left without a win in the Premiership this season and will face the top-ranked Hearts next Sunday, eight points ahead of them.
Earlier on Thursday, Rangers Rapid will host Vienna in the Europa League.
Livingston, who has already extended their unbeaten run in the division to six games, has yet to taste the defeat as the head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses a lot of chances against their uncontested opponents.
They should have been ahead long before the Joomla Holt team scored, since their aggressive attitude caused all kinds of problems for the Rangers!
When Scott Robinson broke through the defense but failed to deliver on his own efforts, Allan Lithgow could only drive his effort on the Wideway after sliding over to meet Craig Halkett's header.
Hosts were allowing the Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that the guests could have trouble in the set-piece.
And that strategy came with an important goal.
The Oak Rangers do a free-kick concede and open the Livingston goalkeeper's account. Declan Gallagher and Robinson come together to set up the Menga, who scored from the center of the box in one touch.
At this stage, the Rangers dominated the possession of the ball, but they knew the defense of the hosts as impermissible, and goalkeeper Liam Kelley spent most of the time e-defence.
This trend continued even in the second half, though Alfredo Morlos fired a shot at Kelly.
Scott Pittman was defeated at the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor and won another set of pieces for Livingstone from Lithgow Wide.
The Cherokee Cross was constantly coming to the Livingston box and was constantly being cleared, although the demand for two penalties - alternative Glenn Middleton - was dismissed after Hallett's challenge and for handball.
" The Incredible " Celebrity Livingston - Analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont Tony McCarney Arena
It's a fantastic performance and results for Livingstone.
To some person in the crowd, they were great, continuing to exceed everyone's expectations at their upward speed.
The nature of their play and players have rarely changed since they returned to the top level, but credit must go to Holt for the way he has teamed up since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was extraordinary, created an excellently organized defense, and kept the menga Connor Goldson and Joe Warhol on the board at all times.
Despite this, the runners were less motivated.
They were as good as they were under the guise of a young guerrilla.
They lacked their final ball - only once they opened the hosts - and that's a warning to the Rangers, who are now in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an found in Cologne mixed reception
The situation was very pleasant when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin on Saturday (September 29) for a Brexit.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which is aimed at repairing relations between NATO allies.
They discussed human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Kokodak Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then proceeded to Cologne for the opening of a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police have made a security cover to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but a lot of supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurdish - were heard condemning both Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's policy and his decision to welcome him home in Germany.
This conflicting demonstration in the parliament proves that one visitor is hailed as a hero by the German Turks and condemned by others as a dictator.
Road accident in Deptford: Bike rider killed in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place near the link between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, south-east of the city of Nagara, at around 10 a.m. Bangladesh time.
The driver stopped the car and the cyclist was given primary treatment, but the man died on the spot.
The accident happened again a few months after another bike accident on Children's Street, which is located 1 mile away from the crash site on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said officials were working to identify the man and inform his next relatives.
The road has been closed and bus stops have been put in place and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lorraine Jail: Six officers were injured in the chaos.
Six police officers were injured in the high security men's prison disturbance, the Prison Office said.
Clashes broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at 9:30 am on Sunday and it is going on.
Specialist "tornedo" officers have been brought in to deal with chaos, including eight prisoners who are included in a branch.
Officers at the scene of the incident were treated for injuries to the face of the officer.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to deal with an incident going on in HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of staff have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the guilty will be taken under the law and they will spend a long time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison administrator had gone to the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, the officers were called to the jail to deal with a serious disturbance where workers were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa is threatening to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City. (Although drought-prone areas may benefit)
Hurricanes are rare to hit in the Arizona of tropical low pressures, but that seems to happen as early as next week when Hurricane Roza will continue to thrive with its residual strength across the southwestern desert, including the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood watches in Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City cities, including South and East Nevada, southeast California and Utah in western Arizona for Monday and Tuesday.
Fasting is expected to reach the phoenix directly on Tuesday and with rain by the end of Monday.
In a tweet, the National Meteorological Department of Phoenix stated that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or low pressure conditions within 200 miles of Phoenix since the 1950s!"
Caucasian Caterina (1967) which was a hurricane within 40 miles of the A-Z border.”
The latest model of the National Hurricane Center predicts rainfall from 2 to 4 inches, at the Mogul Rim in Arizona, which can range up to 6 inches in isolated amounts.
Other areas in the southwestern desert, including Mount Central Rockies and the Great Basin, are likely to receive roughly 1 to 2 inches of rain, which can range up to 4 inches in isolated amounts.
Fast rain showers can be a blessing for people who are out of the risk of flooding as the areas are prone to drought.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, this rainfall is likely to be of some benefit as the southwest is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to U.S. drought monitoring, more than 40 percent of Arizona is facing extreme drought, according to Weather.com, the second-highest category.
First of all, Hurricane Rosa's path will cause landslides across the Gulf of Mexico's Baja California peninsula.
Fasting, a still powerful hurricane, is moving at a maximum speed of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and 12 miles per hour north.
The storm is energizing because it is facing cold water in the Pacific Ocean.
So, on Monday afternoon or evening, the force of the tropical storm is expected to cause a landslide in Mexico.
Heavy rains may occur across parts of Mexico, which poses a significant flood risk.
"There is a possibility of rain up to 10 inches from Baja California to the northwestern Sonora"
The fast will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical depression before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning, and it will enter southern Utah via Arizona on Tuesday night.
"The main danger expected from the disease or its remains is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and southwestern deserts of the United States," according to the National Hurricane Center.
Rainfall in the rainy season can lead to life-threatening sudden floods and devastating currents in the desert and landslides in the mountainous regions.
Midsummer Norton attack: Four attempted murder suspects arrested.
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested in Camden Somerset after a 16-year-old stabbed to death was found.
A teenage boy was found injured in midsummer Norton's Axlcier Terrace area around 4pm on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where he is now in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Officers have requested those who may have mobile phone footage to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh's "cruelty, anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote in favor of Judge Cavana, a vote for the Democratic Party to reject the brutal and irritating tactic," said Trump at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh was "serious, angry" of the Democratic Party throughout the process of his nomination.
Caucasian Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and passionately denying Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that she had been sexually abused by her hands decades before she was a teenager.
Ford also testified at the hearing of his complaint.
The President of the United States said on Saturday that “the American people have seen the extraordinary and qualities and courage of Kavanaugh that day.”
Speaking to supporters in West Virginia, he said that a vote on behalf of Judge Kavanaugh would be a vote to protect the most successful legal right of our time, a jurist with a public service sterling record."
While speaking about the importance of Republican voting in the midterm elections, the president unequivocally acknowledged Kavanaugh's nomination.
"It's only five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
Even though I'm not participating, I'm actually participating," he said.
"That's why I'm always striving to fight for great candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats were on a "mission to resist and obstruct."
The Senate is not expected to hold its first major presidential vote on Kavanaugh's nomination on Friday, a senior GOP-led aide told CNN.
Hundreds of people have been killed in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
At least 384 people have been killed and many have drowned after a massive wave crashed on a beach on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi after a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of thousands of people gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when a six-metre (18 feet) high wave broke out on the beach in the evening, driving many to their deaths and destroying everything along the way."
The tsunami came after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"People continued their activities on the beach even when there was a tsunami threat yesterday, and those who could not run immediately and became victims of it," said Sutopo Puro, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency, the BNP, in a briefing in Nugroho Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come by itself, it dragged all of the cars, logs, houses, it hit everything above the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled at speeds of 800 kilometers (497 miles) per hour in the open sea before hitting the shore.
Some of the people climbed the tree to survive the tsunami, and they survived.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Images from the sky released by the disaster agency show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been overturned and collapsed, and a mosque has been submerged in water.
Saturday's events also take place on the coast of the city.
The series of earthquakes was felt in the region of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times the capacity of the atomic bomb in World War II's Hiroshima.
The geographical location of the city of Chowk, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, can further exacerbate the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "massive," saying that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Some of the dead bodies were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed building, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing."
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater in an area called Dangala, near the epicenter of the earthquake, along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu.
The communication system was "completely decomposed without any information," Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people are living there, "the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that workers and volunteers are going to the affected areas."
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
The agency was heavily criticised on Saturday for not giving information that the tsunami hit the Palu, although officials said the waves came only when the alert was issued.
In the raw hand footage shared on social media, one of the men on the top floor of the building was seen screaming to people on the street below and listening to the tsunami warning.
Within a few minutes, a walled stream of water hit the shore and flooded buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the footage.
Earthquakes and tsunamis caused a power outage that disconnected communications around the pool and made the authorities' rescue operations difficult.
The Armed Forces have started sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, adding that rescuers are now very much in need of food and other basic essentials.
The city's airport has been reopened only for relief efforts and will remain closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit Palu's shelters on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
It's a terrible thing.
According to Mr. Dosseau, when the World Organization's personnel were safely going from Dongala to the city of Palu, where the employees were taking shelter in their office courtyards, they saw images of the road breaking down.
"They've seen a lot of houses destroyed," Dosseau said.
It's a sad thing.
Even when aid teams went to start disaster relief operations, some were complaining that foreign aid workers were being barred from travelling to Palu with a lot of skill.
According to Indonesian law, foreign funding, food supplies and staff can only come when the place of a disaster is declared as a national disaster zone.
But it has not been announced yet.
"It's still a province-level disaster," Auliya Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross, said.
"If the government says yes, it is a national disaster," he said, "we can start international aid, but there is no announcement yet."
Even on the second night of Friday's tsunami strike in Palu, friends and family of the missing are hoping for a miracle that will bring the light of hope at the end of a brutal chapter of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was picked up from the North Pole.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been stabbed to death by her mother for two days.
The coach of the Deccan Indonesian national paragliding team, Gendon Subandono, trained two paragliders of the Asian Games, who are now missing, which took place in Indonesia earlier this month.
Mr. Mendagi also mentioned that those who were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
He added, “As a pioneer in the field of paragliding, I have a responsibility to my own emotions.”
Mr. Gendon recalled how the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel spread to the paragliding community hours later, he backtracked and spread it to the Palu contestants via WhatsApp message, who participated in a festival on the beach.
The message was deleted instead of being sent.
He said, “That means the message has not been sent.”
The thieves stole $26,750 when they re-entered the ATM machine at Newport.
According to a press release from the Newport Police Department, on Friday morning, the thieves stole $26,750 while Brinks staff kept the money at ATMs.
The driver of the car was emptying ATM money in the entertainment complex and was ready to pay more. Detective Dennis McCarthy told a news conference.
While he was working, another "run from the back of a Brinks worker" and ran away with a money-filled bag that was ready to be handed over.
According to the press release, witnesses saw many suspects fleeing, but police have not yet specified the number of people involved in the incident.
If anyone can identify these individuals, they are being asked to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper has changed his name.
The rapper Kane West has changed his name to Yee.
Announcing the change, he wrote on Twitter on Saturday: "Formally known as Kane West."
West, 41, was also known as Ye for a long time and used the name as its title.
The subject of the name change was revealed before his appearance on T-Saturday Night Live, where he hoped to unveil his new album Yandy.
The show's producer said he was replacing singer Ariana Grande, who canceled the event "for "excited reasons."
West had previously said that the word had religious significance to him, as well as a short form of his current professional name.
While discussing the title of the album with radio broadcaster Big Boy at the beginning of the year West said, "I believe that 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'.
"We are you, we are you, we are you."
It is said from the Caucasian Kane, which means that the only person, Y, reflects our good, bad, our confusion, everything.
This album reflects more of our identity.”
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their names.
Foshan Combs is known in different ways as Puff Daddy, PDD or DD, but this year he declared Love and Brothers Love as the preferred name.
J-G, a former associate of West, has worked with Hyphen, without Hyphen, and with Capital.
Mexico's AMLO also vowed not to impose military force on ordinary citizens.
Mexico's President-elect Andr<0xC3><0xA9>s Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez has vowed not to use military force against the citizens of Mexico on the 50th anniversary of the bloodshed against students.
Lafayette Lopez Abrado promised Saturday at the Toltec<0xC3><0xB3> Plaza that “Don’t use military force to oppress the people of Mexico.”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on peaceful protests that killed 300 people while the left-wing student movement in Latin America was building a strong position.
Mr. Lopez apologized to the young Mexicans, with the help of monthly education allowances and more government universities.
He said the lack of education and employment opportunities is creating problems for the youth.
The U.S. should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States and the United States should also double the amount spent on research in this area, says artificial intelligence researcher and investor Kai-fu Li, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The statement comes from various parts of the government, announcing in the United States that there is a formal strategic deficit in artificial intelligence in the United States.
China has already launched its new plan last year: it aims to rank number one in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“Double-budget in artificial intelligence research will be a good new start, with most countries lagging far behind in this area and we’re looking for the next step to advance artificial intelligence.”
Double the amount of funding that could double the chances of the U.S. achieving the next big artificial intelligence, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Cecile Lee, whose book “All Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” this month, Hutton Mifflin Harcourt, chief executive of Innovation Ventures, has invested in Face<0x2B><0x2B>, one of China’s leading artificial intelligence companies.
During the 1980s, he worked on an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University that defeated the American player with the highest rank and was the executive of Microsoft Research and the president of Google's China branch.
The Defense Advanced Research Project Agency has acknowledged the technology competition of the previous U.S. government, like the Robotics Challenge, to determine the next step.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee said.
"China is not removing academic leaders; the corporates are doing it," Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired illumined people from universities to work in artificial intelligence in recent years.
Mr Lee said the changes in immigration policy could help boost the U.S.'s AI efforts.
“I think the green card should be offered automatically to the Ph.D. in artificial intelligence,” he said. SI’s AI efforts further intensified.
China's State Council issued its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions, such as the National Science Foundation and other government agencies that spend money on U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is low, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint artificial intelligence center, which means involving industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of an election committee on artificial intelligence.
In April and this month, the DRPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As an NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million per year in research in artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, US legislation trying to form a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not seen progress in a few months.
In a referendum on whether to change the name of the country, the Macedonians voted to change the name of the country.
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether to keep the name "Republic of North Macedonia," a move that would resolve decades-old conflicts with Greece that blocked attempts to gain membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where there is a province called Macedonia, its northern neighbor's name represents a claim to its territory and vetoed the entry of NATO and the European Union.
The two governments signed a deal in June on the basis of the new names proposed, but opponents of the nationalist feel that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slavic population in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov has said he will not vote in a referendum and doubts whether the turnout will meet the minimum 50 percent required to legalize a public vote in a boycott campaign.
The question in the referendum ballot was: “You are for NATO and European Union membership with the recognition of the agreement with Greece.”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Joran Zaev, have argued for paying the price for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the fall of Yugoslavia, to be admitted to the European Union and NATO organizations.
"I'm here today to vote for the youth in Macedonia, for the future of the country, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safe life for all of us," the 79-year-old Olivier Georgievska said in Skopje.
While the law is not legally binding, adequate members of parliament have said they will abide by the outcome of the vote by making decisions.
A two-thirds majority is needed to change the name.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities at 1 pm.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent of the 2016 national parliamentary elections, while 66 per cent of registered voters voted for them.
"I came to vote because of my children, we have a place in Europe," said Jos<0xC3><0xA9> Tentevsky, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Joran Zaev, his wife Jorka and his son Dushko voted to change the country's name in favor of the referendum in Macedonia, which will open the way for NATO and the European Union to join Macedonia's Strumica on September 30, 2018.
The 54-year-old Vladimir Kavadarkov was preparing a small stage in front of the parliament at the Skopje and pulling a chair in front of the tents set up for those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are in favor of NATO and the European Union, but we want to join our heads up, not through the door of service," said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can go to others like China and Russia and be part of the Euro-Asia solidarity.”
Prime Minister Zaev said the NATO membership will bring the necessary investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favor because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of the European Union and NATO," Zaev said after his ballot.
He said that a "yes" result would be our "confirmation of the future."
According to a survey published on Monday by the Institute for Policy Research in Macedonia, 30 to 43 percent of voters will vote in a referendum below the required turnout.
Another survey, conducted by Telma TV, found that 57 percent of the respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote yes.
A referendum must have more than 50 percent of the vote to be successful.
The failure of the referendum will represent the first fatal blow to Western pro-government policy since taking power in May last year.
View view: Enter the entire Brighton Defence for Manchester City's Sergio Aguero goal
England beat Manchester City 2-0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester on Saturday to defeat the defending champions Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling.
Aguero made it extra easy to see his score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker got a pass in the midfield at the start of the Sequence.
He ran through three Brighton defenders before going to the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green jerseys.
He turned to a defender before crossing several others at the edge of the Brighton box.
He then pushed a pass to the left, which found sterling.
The English forward returned the ball to Aguero using his first touch in the box, who used his right boot to shoot on the right side of the net, defeating Bryton defender Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems in his legs," City Manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about his game for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are fortunate that he scored a goal at that moment.”
However, Stirling gave Sky Blues the primary advantage of the fight in the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero found the ball deep in the Brighton region in that game.
He sent the ball to Leroy Sen by a beautiful path on the left side of the edge.
Sen had taken a few touches before taking the young sterling to a distant post.
Sky Blues forward tapped the ball into the net just before crossing the border.
Citigroup will face Hafenheim in the Citi Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. in the rain-necker-arena in Sinshim, Germany.
Sherlock Holmes wants to play in a game against the Redskins.
There was not much reason to force the Nationals to start any other after they were removed from the playoffs debate.
However, the ever-competitive Sherger hopes to take the field against Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the play-offs have an impact on the one-game lead against NL West's Los Angeles Dodgers.
Rockies got at least a wild card spot by winning 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to get their first division title.
"While we're not playing for anything, at least we can put our feet in the rubber with Denver spectators knowing the impact and the other team will probably play at the highest level of any point I'm facing this year."
Why don't I want to compete?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but it is said that sherzer could allow pitching in such a situation.
Shaun Sherger, who will start his 34th time, threw a Bullpen session on Thursday and will pitch at his usual rest on Sunday.

Trump's rally in West Virginia
While speaking about the importance of Republican voting in the midterm elections, the president sharply referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court-selected Brett Kavanaugh.
"Everything we did in November is under threat.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's a big, big -- I'm not running away but that's why I'm all over the place fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take back energy by using any means necessary, you see this downward, downtroddenness.
They don't care who they're hurting, who they're going to have to suffer for power and control, they just want power and control, we don't give it to them."
He said Democrats were on a mission to "resist and prevent."
"And you've seen that over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "enraged and downplayed and nasty and untrustworthy."
He has named Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which received high-pitched applause from the audience.
"Do you remember the answer?"
Did you find the book?
Ahhh, what.
No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm waiting - it was really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a free organization.
People are not allowed to say what they think.
It should come as no surprise that when the people in my neighborhood voted for me, they voted for me.
I was the last Labour MP on the list to announce that your mind-boggling nature will not be welcomed here.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment because she firmly stood up against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was found guilty of disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on Europe and national security, and similar issues on which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The notice for Friday's Nottingham East Labour Meeting stated that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For the first time in my eight years as a local labour MP, the GC meeting on Friday night was exactly the same.
But unfortunately, today, it's not the tone of that meeting and the promise of "decent, gentle" politics has long been forgotten, if indeed it ever began.
It has become increasingly apparent that dissent is not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is judged as to whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It all started as soon as Jeremy became leader, with colleagues I thought I would share a similar political point of view, hoping to get a U-turn on me and ask me to take a position that I would not agree with under any circumstances - be it national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak openly – and though it doesn’t matter what I say – there are calls for me to be removed from social media by being sly, condemning the central politics, and telling me that I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
Actually, I know I'm more fortunate than a few of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are also political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a storm of discrimination or racial abuse on the basis of sex every day but never ashamed.
The most frustrating aspect of this era of politics is how the dexterity of the galactic has become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should build a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a free organization, and every "unprecedented" vote or change of election rules narrows the party.
For the last two years, many people have advised me to keep my head down, not to be so loud, and that I will be "right."
I'm not in politics to do that.
When I joined Labour 32 years ago as a schoolboy, we were instigated by the negligence of the Thatcher government that literally destroyed our extensive school classrooms, I then tried to provide the necessary government services to those who needed the most — whether as a local councilor or as a government minister.
I've never kept my politics secret, including the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East was in any way confused about my policy position and the areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
All I can say for those who promoted the movement on Friday is that when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will hurt families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy by showing loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But I don’t really have a message for Nottingham Momentum, whether it’s to my constituents, Labour members or not: I’m proud to serve you, and I promise that the threat of any impasse or political activity won’t stop me from doing what I believe is of the best interest to all of you.

Aries 38-17 Melrose: Rise to the Top of Unearned Income
Two attempts late may reduce the interval of the final result a bit, but there is no doubt that income was worthy of winning in the Premiership match of this day's extraordinarily entertaining Tencent.
They are now at the top of the table, the only undefeated team out of ten.
By the end of the day, it was their best defense, just as good as their ability to take chances, which helped the hosts win and coach Peter Murchi had the right reason to be happy.
“We’ve been tested in every game so far and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy.”
Robin Christie of Comcast Melrose said: “Iron has to be given credit, they’ve worked their chances better than we do.”
The 14th minute attempt by Grant Anderson, transformed by Frazier's Clemos, led the Iron forward, however, a yellow card from Scotland's player Rory Hughes, which expelled him for the game by the Warriors, giving Melrose a majority, and Jason Baglott a failed attempt.
Climo scored a goal in the penalty, just before halftime, he scored a goal in a single attempt to make it 17-5 in the break.
But Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, transformed by bagot, reduced the gap by five points.
The game was then shut down for a long time for serious injury to the rudimentary knot, which had become stretchered and after the restart of the game, income went a long way through the efforts of Stafford McDowell, which was transformed by Clemo.
Acting captain Blair McPherson then received a yellow card and once again ended up in a spell of severe pressure, Melrose's Bruce Colvin tried to punish Ayer's extra player.
Although the hosts return exactly, and when Struan sees a yellow card to deal with Clemo without the Huchinson ball, McFerson touchdowns from the penalty line out and pushes the revenue mall forward.
It was again converted to climo, by Kyle Roe when David Armstrong's box kick was bogged down and Flanker Gregor Henry was sent out on a fifth attempt on the home side.
Rocket Steel Game Star Ready for a New Career in the Restaurant Industry
After being nominated as the director of a licensed restaurant company, Couscous Steel Game star Ford Kieran has said he is ready to enter the hospitality industry.
The 56-year-old star played Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he himself wrote and co-starred with long-time comic partner Greg Hemphill.
Both of them have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the show's last series and it looks like Kieran is planning his own life after Craigslist.
According to the list of official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, although Scottish Sun sources indicated that Keirnan wanted to be involved in Glasgow's "rich restaurant business."
"The Sea is Ours": Bolivia, landlocked, hopes the court will reopen its path to the Pacific Ocean.
Sailors are patrolling a rigging clad naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings are flying an ocean-blue flag.
From Lake Titicaca to Amazon, the naval bases are equipped with this motto: "The sea is our right"
It's a responsibility to restore it."
Throughout the landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the 19th century losing to Chile in a bloody resource conflict is still clear – just as the desire to travel to the Pacific Ocean once again.
These expectations are probably the highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice's verdict on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has that speed, unity and unwavering spirit, and of course we look forward to results with a positive outlook," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Caljadilla.
Many Bolivians will see the ICJ ruling on a large screen across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will go in favor of Bolivia's claim that - after decades of appropriate negotiations - Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign outlet to Bolivia at sea.
C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire, Bolivia's karishmetic indigenous president - who will face a controversial battle for re-election next year - also relies a lot on Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision on Bolivia - and if so, it will change little.
The Netherlands-based UN agency does not have the power to grant land to Chile and says it will not determine the outcome of the possible negotiations.
The ICJ's ruling that comes just six months after hearing the final argument indicates that the case was "not complicated," said Paige Zerrett, an expert in Chilean international law.
In the last four years, it may have gone back and forth rather than furthering the cause of Botswana and Bolivia.
"The issue of sea access has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Gerett said.
Mock Morales' anti-war speech has lifted any surplus greetings from Chile, he said.
Bolivia and Chile may continue to talk until a stage, but it will be very difficult to discuss later.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Bolivia's representative to The Hague, former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltz, has rejected the court's decision to be unusually quick.
Monday will bring an opportunity to Bolivia "a great opportunity for a new era in its relationship with Chile" and "to end 139 years of conflict with mutual benefit".
Kathleen Caljadila also denied that Morales - still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America - was using the maritime issue as a political pillar.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to enter the Pacific," he added.
"It's an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea has said that nuclear disarmament will not come until the United States trusts the United States.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said that his nation will not denuclearize if it does not trust Washington.
He made the remarks at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to abide by the commitments made by rival leaders during a summit in Singapore.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of resuming a stagnant nuclear diplomacy with North Korea's Kim Jong Un after more than three months in Singapore.
Ri said it was a "pipe dream" that continued sanctions and the U.S.'s objection to the declaration of the end of the Korean War would threaten North Korea.
Washington warned that Pyongyang could agree to the declaration without the first significant disarmament process.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump both want a second summit.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning an arsenal, which the country is likely seeing as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo also plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of huge headwear along the way to a high street near you.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or block the sun completely, there's no need to look any further.
Design designers Valentino and Thom Brown unveiled a series of oversized head gears for their SS19 collection on the runway that rocked the style set at the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer's highly unusual hat has been leaked on Instagram and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations to Katwa.
One of the creations of the Vampire Valentino was an over-the-top beige hat equipped with a wide rod like a feather that covered the heads of models.
Other oversized accessories on the go include decorative melons, a wizard's hat, even a pineapple - but they aren't designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Brown has also published a selection of bizarre masks - and exactly at the right time for Halloween.
The lips of many colorful masks were stitched and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than horror funny.
One creation is similar to the full scuba diving gear with snorkels and goggles, the other looks like a molten ice cream cone.
And if you continue with the big fashion statement - then you're lucky.
Style-style observers have predicted that huge bunnies can go to the high street near you.
Outsourcing hats compete with 'La Bomba', a two-foot wide-brimmed straw hat that has been worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The call label on the back of the highly unreasonable hat scattered across social media has sent another large creation to Katwa - a straw beach bag that is almost as big as a swimmer's costume model.
Paris Fashion Week was one of the first of the collections of the Burning Orange Raffia bag at La Riverera SS19 in the Paris Fashion Week, with Raffia freezing, trimming and a white leather handle at the top.
"I hope that next summer big hats and beach bags will arrive on the high street - as the designer has made such a big impact, it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edwards: Linguistic skills are essential for world citizens.
Scotland's independent schools maintain a track record of academic excellence, and it continues to produce another outstanding test result in 2018, which is only reinforced by personal and collective success in sports, art, music, and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for more and higher education, their chosen profession and their place as world citizens.
As an educational field that a particular school can design and implement curriculum, we see modern languages continue to be popular and preferred topics in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.”
If you talk to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It's a powerful reminder that we can't rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's recent tests, we can see that languages top the league tables with the highest pass rate among individual schools.
A total of 68% of foreign language students have achieved higher grades.
Data collected from schools of 74 members of SCIS showed that 72 per cent of students achieved higher grades in Mandarin, while 72 per cent achieved higher grades in German, 69 per cent in French, and 63 per cent in Spanish.
Aakash proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language is now, as the subject choice, being held in the same way as individual school curriculum and elsewhere in STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics).
A 2014 study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 percent of employers blamed a lack of language skills for the reasons they fought to fill the vacancy.
So much so, language skills are becoming essential for young people to prepare for their future careers.
These skills are needed in a globalized world for more potential job opportunities that require language.
Anyone who chooses a career, if they learn a second language, will have a real advantage in the future with their life-long skills.
Being able to communicate directly with foreigners automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 Yugov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent were not able to speak a foreign language well at the time of the conversation, and French was the only language of the decade-number percentage, 15 percent.
That's why investing in language education is important for today's children.
Having multiple languages, especially the language of the developing economy, will provide better opportunities for children to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will be different in their taught languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while in 2020 it will be seen that others will teach languages that are considered to be most important to the UK, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be many languages to choose from in individual schools, including expert teaching staff in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing an education environment that will prepare children and build them with the skills necessary to succeed in the future.
In a global business environment, it cannot be denied at the moment that languages play an important role for the future of the country, so it must reflect in the field of education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be considered as "international communication skills."
The unique independent schools will provide this choice, diversity, and encouragement for Scotland's youth.
It needs to be done.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will debut at the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
Fans are almost ready to watch LeBron James begin his first journey for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Naggets in San Diego.
It is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on Lakers' official website.
Mike Truddell, a reporter for Lakers, tweeted that James would probably play a limited minute.
After practicing early this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need a preseason game to be ready at this stage of my career," he said.
During Trump's West Virginia rally, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is holding a rally in West Virginia tonight.
This is the first of Trump's next week's five scheduled gatherings, including stops at friendly places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of confirmation of his election to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump is aiming to build support for the next mid-term election, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress after voting in November.
What time has it been for Trump's West Virginia rally tonight, and how do you see it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak on the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's hearing this week, which has been heated by allegations of sexual misconduct with an expected Senate confirmation vote during an FBI investigation.
But the primary goal of the opening of these gatherings is to help Republicans gain some momentum in the face of the November election.
In this way, President Trump's campaign said that the purpose of these five rallies next week is to "emphasize volunteers and supporters, as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority under the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters said.
"Congress control is so important for its agenda that as soon as we enter the busy campaign season, the president will travel to as many states as possible," a Trump campaign spokesman, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
Scheduled for the Wesbenko Arena at Wheeling, today's rally "can bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and bring coverage from the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
This is the second time Trump has visited West Virginia since last month, the state he won by more than 40% in 2016.
In the run-up to Trump's election, West Virginia is trying to help Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind.
"It's not a very good sign for Morrissey that the president should try to give him more incentive in the election," said Simon Heder, a West Virginia University politician, according to Reuters.
Rocky Rider Cup 2018: Team USA shows hunger to fight to keep hope alive in Sunday's singles
This rider's cup was needed on Saturday afternoon at the end of three one-sided sessions.
The pendulum swing of the mule Momentum is a fully-invented sport concept but it's something that the players really believe in, and the most in such a competition.
Where are you going to tell me now, Momma?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so I think we have a little momentum now," Jordan Spieth said walking for the day.
Europe has the advantage of Europe, of course, with 12 more games remaining, four points ahead.
As Keith Spieth said, Americans think they have some help along the way and they can be inspired by a lot of things, especially the forms of Spieth and Justin Thomas who have played all day together, and they have both taken four to three points each.
The vocal movement was deadly from the beginning to the end and is leading from the front.
As he ran his round of applause, he and Thomas trailed by two points after scoring two, taking an important step to grab the four-point full square match.
His jute that won them the match on 15 received the same kind of shout, which tells you a lot that he believes the American team is not out of it.
"You have to go really deep and think about your own match," said Spieth.
All of these players have it now.
There are 18 holes to mark.
The players who have scored more points in the last two days than Cousin Spieth and Thomas are only Francisco Malinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe is a strange but adorable pair of four to four and can't make any mistakes.
"Mollywood" was the only pair who didn't shoot any bogies on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided bogies on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and Friday mornings at the back nine.
That run, and the manner in which their energy was flowing from and to this enthusiastic crowd, seemed to be the players they lost on Sunday, and there are no more likely popular players to seal the European victory without Fleetwood or Mullinary as the sun sets on Le Golf National.
It would be better if both were in different holes at the same time.
The Europeans, however, are proud of their European heritage.
Buba Watson and Web Simpson had some problems with the morning foreboding hero Sergio Garcia when they tied up with Alex Norrene.
In the first nine, he threw a bogey and two double Spaniards and a swedish into a hole from which they could never get up.
On Sunday, though, there's no one to get you out of your hole.
It is very interesting to see from the vicinity of Foreball and Foursome due to the mutual interaction between the two tied together, the suggestion that they do not suggest, and the tactic that can change immediately.
Europe has played relatively well as a team so far and has taken an important lead on the final day but this foursome session has also proved that Team USA's hunger for combat is something that some, notably Stateside, doubted.
Europe took a 10-6 lead on the final day of the Rachael Rider Cup.
Europe will take a healthy lead of 10-6 against the United States from Saturday's foreball and foursome matches on the final day of the Crew Rider Cup.
The enthusiastic duo, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Mullinary, led the two-time wins against the legendary Tiger Woods, taking their tally to four points at the Golf Nationals.
The European team of Thomas Journe, bid to recover the lost trophy to Hazelton two years ago, blew up the flawed American side in the morning force and won the series 3-1.
North America offered further resistance to Foursome by winning two matches, but they could not meet the shortfall.
Jim Furick's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to recover the knockout trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points, and he and Malinari, the only pair to score four points from the first four matches in Rider's Cup history after an extraordinary weekend.
They then imprisoned a losing Woods and American Rookie Bryson Decambyu, who were superbly superbly beaten by 5 and 4.
Woods, who pulled himself into the two games on Saturday, occasionally stormed the limelight but has now lost 19 matches and seven draws out of his 29 matches in Foreball and Foursom.
Justin Rose, resting for the morning force, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in Foursome, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepkar 2 and 1 - number one and number three in the world.
Paris is a pleasant, windy day on the southwest side of Paris, although Europe did not have it on its own.
Three-time major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmarks for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won 2 and 1 against Spain's Zone Ram and Ian Polter in the Foreballs, and lost the opening two holes in the Foursomes to Polter and Rory McLroy in 4 and 3.
Only twice in the history of the Rachael Rider Cup, a team has come back from a four-point shortfall in the singles, although as of now only a draw is needed to recover the trophy from Furick's side.
After being the second best for two days, however, Sunday's counterattack looks like it will overtake them.
North Korea says it will not be disarmed unilaterally without "faith."
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the existing sanctions are deepening its distrust of the United States and in such a situation, the country has no chance of unilaterally giving up its nuclear weapons.
At the annual General Assembly of the World Organization, North Korea said it had taken "significant congratulatory steps" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, breaking the nuclear laboratory, and promising not to expand nuclear technology and the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
"But we have not seen any similar reaction in the United States," he said.
"If we have no confidence in the United States, we will have no confidence in our national security, and there is no way we can unilaterally disarm on our own in such a situation."
Although Ri was describing North Korea's charges against Washington's "strategic" approach to nuclear disarmament that would be rewarded for its slow action by North Korea, his remarks appeared to be significant because he did not unilaterally exclude nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang has done so in the past.
Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump issued a joint statement at the first summit between the U.S. President and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work on "nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula" and when Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also refuted calls for tighter international sanctions on North Korea.
They also objected to the announcement of the "end of the war", saying that the "America has insisted on disarmament-first" and that sanctions have increased pressure levels to achieve their objectives with obligation, even as they ended the war ".
"The idea that restrictions can put us on the ground is an elusive dream of those who don't know about us."
The problem, however, is that the continued ban deepens our distrust.”
Kim did not comment on the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. president outlined at the United Nations earlier in the week.
The Minister of State, instead, referred to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months: “If this issue of disarmament had been South Korea without the United States, the issue of disarmament on the Korean Peninsula would not have come to such a standstill.”
Still, Ri's speech tone was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target the U.S. mainland with North Korean rockets when "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a suicide "rocket man."
At the United Nations this year, Trump, last year, threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarmament, but said there was still a lot of work to be done and sanctions must continue until North Korea disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for it, saying, "If it takes two years, three years, or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argued that Pyongyang should be rewarded for the actions taken by the UN Security Council.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Americans. The Security Council on Thursday said that: “The Security Council’s sanctions must continue to be effective until we realize fully fully verified disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously extended sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to stop funding Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile program.
Pompeo also met with Ri at the UN General Assembly in Assemblee and later said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
In July, when he left Pyongyang, he said that some progress had been made, only a few hours before North Korea could denounce him for "claiming like a goon!"
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "similar measures."
He said the "relevant steps" that Kim was looking for were the security guarantee that Trump had given to Singapore and the security guarantee that he was moving towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking the course to get enough rest.
This year, a new course at Harvard University is gearing up for all of its graduates to get more sleep to cope with the growing culture of night-sleeping "Ratzaga", a caffeine-fueled program at Harvard University.
One of the teachers found that students at number one universities in the world are often confused about very basic issues about how to take care of themselves.
This course has been developed by Charles Sigler, a professor of sleep medicine at the Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, which he believes is the first in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture about the impact sleep deprivation had on the education sector.
“At the end of it, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why am I told this so long that my senior year has come?’ ”
"No one ever told him about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told the Telegraph.
This course, launched for the first time this year, explains how sleep best practices help students achieve academic and athletic performance, as well as what is necessary to improve their general health.
Paul Bariera, a psychiatrist professor at the Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health care department, said the university had decided to launch the course after students were severely deprived of sleep this week.
The one hour long course consists of some interrelated tasks.
A section of the library contains images of a dorm room, where students will learn about the effects of caffeine and light by clicking on coffee cups, screens, trainers and books, and learn how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation and realize the importance of a bedtime routine.
In another category of sleep deprivation, participants are asked how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
We know that this will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you decide to smoke, but also have a right to know its effects on health," Sisila added.
He said the culture of “staying up all night” pride still exists, adding that sleep deprivation is a growing problem due to modern technology and the increasing pressure on students.
A student should be a 'secret weapon' to combat stress, fatigue, and anxiety to ensure that you sleep well enough, he said - even sleep deprivation makes the brain go hungry, making them constantly hungry."
Raymond So, 19, who studied chemical and physical biology in California, helped Professor Sisler design the course, also taking a class during his first year at Harvard last year.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to pursue a campus-wide course.
In the next step, she hopes that all postgraduate students will be requested to complete such a study program before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Sigilla recommended that students should consider setting up an alarm for when to go to bed as well as when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which may destroy your circadian rhythm, resulting in problems falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Manga's defeat of the Golem Gerard's champions.
The Rangers saw a 1-0 loss to Steven Gerrard's random team at Dolly Menger's goal as they lost to Livingston.
After a 4-1 win at St. Johnston in February, the team looked to another victory, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerard's second defeat as manager in 18 matches, taking him eight points away from the heartes at Ledbroke's premiership top.
Menga was hit seven minutes before the half-time, but the hopeless Rangers line-up never hit them.
The Rocky Rangers are now down to sixth place, Livingston has moved up to third place and trails Hibernian in goal difference.
There may be more problems for the masses and rangers as the lineman Calam Spence had to be treated for head injuries for an object that was cut off from the edge of the road.
The Giants made eight changes to the Gerard team that made it to the semi-finals of the Batfred Cup in the top of the Iron.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Levi 11 that took one point from Hearts last week and was supposed to be proud of the way his well-equipped team beat the opponent to the punch.
There may be domination over the possession of the ball of the Cavaliers rangers, but Livingston has done more with their ball.
Menger should have scored in just two minutes if he sent Scott Pittman for the first-ever Le-of-Allan McGregor goal, but the midfielder wasted his big opportunity.
Kahn got Craig Halkett, a long free-kick captain of Kegan Jacobs, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was only able to hit the ball in the back post.
The Giants regained control of the Rangers but had more hope than they believed in playing in the final third.
Alfredo Morlos certainly felt that he should have received his penalty in the quarter-hour due to the clash between him and Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson dismissed Columbian's application.
While the Red Rangers could only target two shots on target in the first half, former Ebrox goalkeeper Liam Kelley was barely hit by the head of Lasana Kulibali and the shot from OV Azeria.
Livi's 34th minute opening goal may have been against the currents of the game, but no one can deny that they are the sole defenders of this designer's game.
He failed to manage the Rangers' Jacobs Deep Set-Piece again.
Scott Arfield didn't react because of Scott Robinson's ball slotting, he kept his head cool to pick up the manga for general finishing.
Gerard took an action in the break with Ryan Kent to replace Kulibli, and the change was almost instantaneous as the winger was in Morales, but the extraordinary Kelly moved him from the line to the block.
But while Livingston viewers started playing exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, Lithgow and Halket were sending long balls after a long ball.
The Joomla Holt team could also advance to the final stage of their lead, but McGregor stood up to ruin Jacobs' efforts before heading out of the Lithgow Corner.
Thomson once again turned his back on the claim of Glenn Middleton, a substitutor of the rangers who demanded Let's Penalty, with Jack Jacobs.
Almanac: the inventor of the Gayger counter.
A page from Almanac and now our "Sunday Morning" page: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today... The day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Giger was born in Germany.
Gaeger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that eventually became known as the Gaeger Counter.
Since then, a core of science, Gaygar Counter has also become the cornerstone of a pop culture, starring seemingly promising cuecock scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado:
Man: "What is this?"
Rogers: "It is used to detect radioactive minerals such as a gigagger counter, uranium.
When you give these earphones to the bride, you can hear the effects of the atoms given by the radiation between the minerals.”
Cousin Evans: "Does it say a lot of words?"
"Hans" Gaeger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But his discovery is still alive.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to detect rogue cells.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to detect and kill rogue cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify rogue cells as part of the treatment.
The procedure involves removing the immune cells from the patient and changing them in the lab.
Then they can 'see' a protein common to many cancers and then re-enter.
An experimental vaccine has shown promising results with patients of different levels of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to detect rogue cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" the normal proteins of many cancers called HER2, and then re-entering the cells.
Professor J. Barzaffski of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "increases the growth of a variety of cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer," explained Professor Barzoffsky.
It has also worked out a similar approach to treating leukemia to eliminate immune cells outside patients and "learn how to target cancer cells."
Kanye West joins Pro-Trump debate in SNL after wearing a MAGA hat
It didn't feel good
Kanye West was booed at the studio after a long performance during Saturday Night Live where he praised U.S. President Donald Trump, saying he would continue to hold the post in 2020.
After performing his third song of the night called Kahn Ghost Town, where he wore a Make America Great Cap, he denounced the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"A lot of times when I talk to a white person, they say: "How can you like Trump, he's a racist!"
"If I had been concerned about racism, I would have been out of the United States long ago," he said.
Aceh began the show with a skit starring SNL Matt Damon where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Judicial Committee in the Senate over claims of sexual assault by Christine Blazi Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, West's scathing footage of comedian Chris Rock has been uploaded on social media.
It's unclear if West was trying to make a mockery of the Rock Post.
He also complained to Western audiences that he had to face backstabbing problems with his head.
"They put me in the backseat."
They said, 'Don't go out wearing a hat.'
They beat me up!
And then they say I'm in a sinking place," according to the Washington Examiner's source.
West also said: “Do you want to see the place?” By saying that he will read his own “Superman Cape, because that means you can’t tell me what to do.” <0xE2><0x86><0x92> Do you want to see the world moving forward?
Try it with love."
His comments were booed at least twice from the audience, and SNL cast members felt embarrassed, the Variety reported, where one person told the publication: “There was a pinball silence throughout the studio.”
West was brought in as an alternative to singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West I Love It song performs in the style of Periyar bottle and confuses many.
West received support from Kandes Turner, the head of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: “One of the bravest souls: Thank you for standing up against the evildoers.”
However, talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was "what it was and he's absolutely awesome."
"But I chose not to reward anyone (buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") who is embracing and spreading harmful ideals for my community.
He is free.
"And so are we," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he is now "officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist who changed his name and followed his path to DD, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffie and PDD.
Another contemporary rapper, Snoop Dogg, was named Snoop Leon and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol that was previously known as Prince.
A man has been charged with attempted murder at a restaurant in Belfast.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after stabbing a man at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Baluchistan.
The accused is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
Charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacked toxic masculinity or toxic masculinity.
Kakashi Kit Harington is known for his combative role as Zone Snow in HBO's offensive medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor said about the stereotype of the Macho hero that playing such a role on the screen means giving young boys the idea that they have to be tough to get respect.
While speaking to the San Juan Sunday Times culture, Kit said he believed "something went wrong" and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kayak Kit, who was recently married to his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie at the age of 31, admits she felt strongly about the problem.
"I feel very strongly, personally, at the moment - where are we going wrong in malehood?" he said.
"What have we taught men when they were growing up that we are facing this problem now?"
Kit believes that television toxic masculinity may be partly responsible for the growth of its superhuman characters.
He added: "What are we learning and what are we learning?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that boys feel that they have to follow this particular path in order to be men?
I think this is one of the biggest questions of the time - how do we change it?
The reason is obviously there is some big mistake on the part of the youth. ”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make any Game of Thrones preliminary or sequels when the series is renewed next summer, saying he had ended his life of 'warfield and horse'.
From November to November, Kit will be starring in Sam Shepard's remake of True West, a story about a film producer and his stolen brother.
The actor recently revealed that he considers his wife Rose as the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this show, so it's been a gift to my future family my life.
Igret played the role of the lover of John Snow, Kitt's character in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple got married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China has reported a 14% growth in new cases.
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of HIV and AIDS cases.
There are more than 820,000 infected people in the country, health officials said.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases were due to sexual transmission, which has changed from the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection spreads rapidly to various parts of China for blood circulation.
However, the number of people infected with HIV has been reduced to almost zero this way, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still considered to be prevalent.
Because of the conservative values of the country, the study estimated that 70-90% of men have sex with men, who later marry women.
Infections of many diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has committed to universal access to HIV drugs as part of its efforts to address this problem.
McQueen Waters denied leaking GOP senators' data, "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
Republican Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff posted personal data of three Republican U.S. senators to lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat strongly claimed that these claims were being propagated by "ultra-right wing" scholars and websites.
"False, false, and more hateful lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published data reportedly includes the home address and phone number of U.S. Senators. Senators. Lindsey Graham in South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both Utter.
The information was published online on Thursday, with an unidentified man posted on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Scholars and Redstate reported that the IP address identifying the source of the post was associated with the "Waters" office and revealed information about a member of the Waters staff, Hill reported.
"These baseless allegations are completely false and a perfect lie," Waters continued.
"Members of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these frauds and false accusations - were in no way responsible for leaking this information."
These baseless allegations are completely false and a perfect lie.”
Waters' statement has been quickly criticized by many online, including former White House press secretary Ari Fletcher.
"This denial is angry," wrote Fleisser.
He said: "He doesn't want to be a member of Congress.
They don't get angry when someone is accused of something they didn't do.
They should not be opponents.
They must not question the intention of the complainant.
They must be calm and peaceful.”
Fletcher, who was comparing Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Cavana, felt he was too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Republican presidential candidate Omar Navarro, who is seeking to oust Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"It's really big," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had "warned the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies" about the fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be revealed," he continued, "and any member of my staff and all members will be legally held accountable for all their actions which are destructive and dangerous."
Johnny English Strikes Again Review - Weak Rowan Atkinson Spying
It is now traditional to see the significance of Brexit in any new film, including a British fairy tale, and it seems to be applicable to the revival of the Johnny English action-comedy spoof franchise - which began with Johnny English in 2003 and returned to Johnny English Reborn life in 2011.
Is it possible for us to see how much of a waste we are able to produce as a result of this new technology?
At any rate, pop-eyed, rubber-oriented disabled Johnny English has a license to create new things for the second time - his name more than anything else indicates that he is a broad comic creation designed for the cinema world of languages other than English.
He is certainly a fool's secret representative who, despite the bizarre trend of smooth graffiti, has contributed a note to the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics in London in Shari'ats of Fire Theme, a dash of Mr. Bean and a dolp of the Chap.
He was originally based on the traveller and the international mystery man Atkinson once starred in the forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, spreading chaos in consciousness.
There are one or two great moments in this latest Jee-Outing.
I'd like to see Johnny English come near a helicopter while the rotor blades hang with a little helmet while wearing a medieval armor dress.
Atkinson's gift for physical physical humor is visible, but the joke has been perceived to be quite low-quality and oddly exaggerated, especially as the 007 and Mission Impossible's "Serious" film brand now confidently proposes comedy as an element of confidence.
The comic seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English's bizarre accidents aren't as innovative and centered on Ben's personality as Atkinson's silent-cinema joke.
The long-term topical basis is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker penetrated Britain's most secretive web network of espionage, to reveal the identities of all UK agents in the field, to frustrate the agent responsible - a small role sadly for Kevin Alden.
It's the last hope of a prime minister who is already suffering a complete meltdown of political opposition, is an illusory and bound figure: Emma Thompson has done her best with this semi-tresa-me character but there's not much to work on in the script.
His intelligence advisers told him that every active spy had been compromised, so he had to get someone out of retirement.
The word and its meaning is to speak to Johnny English, who is now employed as a school teacher in some twenty institutions, but teaches beyond the record how to be a disguised worker: here are some good jokes, as English offers the school of detective rock-type academy.
He returned to the English Whitehall for emergency briefings and again reunited with his former long-suffering sidekick Bauer, starring Ben Miller.
Baahubali is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, the role of a jolly-hockey-stick in which Vicky Pepperdine has been somewhat squandered.
So, after making a fatal mistake in Her Majesty's Secret Service, Batman and Robin returned to action and faced Olga Kurlenko's widowed woman Ophelia Bulletover.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is dangerously falling into the magic of the carishmetric technology billionaire, who claims he will be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: Papi Jason Volta, starring Jack Lacy.
English and Bau began to sound strange to their far-reaching high-jinks: they set fire to a flash French restaurant in Wetter's disguise; they began to smuggle themselves into Voltaire's luxury boats, and the English Voltaire's attempts to use the virtual reality headset to familiarize themselves with the interior of the home, creating a pure chaos.
Of course all the stops are drawn for the final stage, but as much as it's mesmerizing and boisterous, there's quite a bit of kids' TV on the whole thing.
It's a very average staff.
Like all the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t have imagined: couldn’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that truly does justice to his talent?
Labour denies that it plans to work four days a week on behalf of Britain but will get paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a key plan that the British will see working four days a week - but getting paid for five days.
According to the report, the team wants the company's owners to share the money they have saved with an additional holiday of employees through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.
It will see employees enjoy a three-day holiday - but still carry the same salary to the house.
Sources said the idea would be "fit" with the party's economic programme and there are plans to move the country on behalf of the workers.
The Trades Union Congress has approved a four-day week transfer as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It doesn't happen overnight, but a four-day workday is an aspiration that suits the team's approach to balance the economy in favor of the workers as well as the team's overall industry."
Not the first Labour Party to support such a concept, the Green Party promised them a four-day working day during their 2017 general election campaign.
At present, the demand is not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A spokesman for the Cayman Labour Party said: “A four-day working day is not a party policy and is not being considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to express his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to give back power to utility companies from "unknown directors" and "beneficiaries."
Shadow Chancellor's plan means that current shareholders of water companies can't get their entire share back because the labor government may give up some 'bad' due to perceived wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to have employees on the company board and create an incorporation ownership fund to justify 10 per cent of the employees of private sector companies, whose annual dividend stands at $500.
Tell Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, "60 Minutes" if Kavanaugh's FBI investigation can change their minds.
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and the Bureau's findings have raised questions about whether a Republican senator could turn their support around.
In an interview aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Payley asked Republican Senators. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham that the FBI could discover something that led them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"I asked to go to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
After the incident, I called him and the complaint came out, and I said, 'Did you do this?'
He was determined, unwavering.”
Graham's vote, of course, seems immutable.
"My mind has been made up about Brett Kavana and a very important complaint will be needed to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett strongly denies it," added Graham, referring to Christine Bliss Ford.
"And the name he said they could not be verified."
It is 36 years old.
I can't see any new changes."
What is Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
Saturday will be the Global Citizen Festival in New York, an annual music event that stars have a great line-up of performance and an equally impressive mission; an end to world poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people flocking to the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy acts such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Sean Mendes, but also raise awareness of the event's real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, described in 2012, is an expansion of the global poverty project, a group that expects poverty alleviation by increasing the number of people actively fighting internationally.
To get a free ticket for events (if you are not willing to pay for VIP tickets), concertgoers had to do multiple tasks or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goals such as volunteer work, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or ending poverty.
But how successful has the global citizen been for 12 years to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people through free concerts a real move to persuade people to take action, or another case of so-called "climaticism" - where people think they're making a real difference by signing an online application or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, moving towards achieving various goals.
It says these measures have helped world leaders announce a commitment and policies worth more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of 2.22 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the team cited 390 commitments and announcements that began with its activities, with at least $10 billion already distributed or funded.
The group estimates that the protected fund has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide so far.
Some of the key commitments include Power of Nutrition, UK-based investors and implementers' partnerships committed to "help children grow their full potential," with a commitment to provide Rwanda with 35 million to end malnutrition problems in the county after more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens were received.
"With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn malnutrition social injustice into a stepping stone to history," Tracey Ulman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, told the public during a power concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 steps were taken in the United States to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
One of the most frequently asked questions on the website is "What do you think we can do to end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen Global replied: "It will be a long and hard road - sometimes we will fall and fail."
But, like the great civil rights and anti-racism movement before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Gene Mony are among those who will perform at this year's event in New York, which will be performed by Deborah-Lee Fern<0xC3><0xA9>s and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. can use the Navy to "block" Russia's energy exports - Home Secretary
Washington could "necessarily" seek refuge in its navy to prevent Russian fuels from coming to the Middle East countries, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinc has revealed, according to Washington Examiner's description.
Genocide of Russia in Syria - notably, where it is working at the invitation of a legitimate government - is an excuse to visit the new fuel market.
"I believe that the reason for their location in the Middle East is because they want to turn on electricity like the center of Eastern Europe, the southernmost part of Europe," he said.
According to the officers and officers, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the power with our navy to keep the seas open and, if necessary, to block their fuel so that it does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke was speaking to participants at an event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that identifies the United States as the "voice of fuel consumers."
He compared Washington's use to Russia and Iran, referring to the same in real terms.
He also referred to Russia's "remaining stress" including a fossil-fuel-based economy, "relevant to the benefits and replacements of less energy than Iran and Russia's financial alternatives," he said.
The Trump administration's goal was to boost the export of cheap liquefied natural gas to European consumers in Europe instead of Russia.
Under its influence, US President Donald Trump himself, along with officials from the Trump administration, is trying to bring Germany back from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, is held captive in the hands of Berlin Moscow."
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which doubles the capacity of the existing pipeline, is ready to take it to 110 billion cubic meters - a fully financially affordable project.
McClellan argues that Washington's strong opposition to the project is nothing more than financial and is an example of unequal competition.
"In my belief, we agree that energy cannot be used as a pressing tool and that consumers should have the ability to choose suppliers," said Alexander Novak, Minister of Energy of Russia, after an interview with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has received a negative response from Germany, with Germany reaffirming its commitment to the project.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI), Germany's leading industry body, has asked the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
After a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) Dieter Kampf said, "We have major problems with the intervention of a third state in our energy supply."
"Find out" Elizabeth Warren's candidacy for the 2020 Presidential race, said a Massachusetts Senator.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would "seek" candidates for the post of president after an interim election.
Warren confirmed that he is in a contest at a town hall in Hollyak, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes women attending the top positions," she said.
"After November 6, I will be vigorously contesting the presidency."
During the course of his speech at the Warren Town Hall, President Donald Trump said Trump was "leading the country in the wrong direction."
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Trump and Trump's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh have been criticized.
"Of course we need a FBI investigation before we vote," Warren said in a tweet on Friday.
According to a study published Thursday, most of Warren's own voters do not think he should contest the 2020 election.
The Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey of the University of Safok states that 85 percent of Massachusetts' "potential" voters say that the senator's vote should not be contested.
Thirty-two percent supported the fight.
The survey found that the vote of former governor Deval Patrick was more supportive of the fight, with 38 percent supporting a potential fight and 48% not.
Other high-profile Democratic names likely to be discussed in the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden will make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Polyn PTSD at Donald Trump's rally
The 26-year-old Tract Palin spent a year in Iraq after enrolling in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
He told the audience at a gathering of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma, that "my own son who goes through it, through his return, I understand other families who can understand the consequences of some of the times that PTSD and our soldiers are returning."
Pablo Palin called his arrest a "home elephant" and told his son and other war veterans that "they come back with some change, they come back strong, they come back to think about whether they have respect for their fellows for what they have done to the Army and Air Force and other members of the military."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilah, Alaska, and according to Dan Bennett, a police department spokesman, he was charged with domestic violence, possession of weapons and drug use.
In 18 states, DC supports the challenge of the new asylum policy.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting the legal challenge against the new U.S. policy that refuses to shelter victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
To support a asylum seeker challenging the policy, representatives from 18 states and districts filed a friend-of-the-court brief in court in Washington on Friday, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the case of Grace V. Sessions, which was filed in August against the American Civil Liberties Union federal policy, was not released.
He said his collaborator "and his violent gang-member boys" abused him, but U.S. officials rejected his asylum application on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
Attorneys from the states supporting the Grease gave examples of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, as a country facing widespread gang and domestic violence problems, from which a large number of applicants came to the United States for asylum.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned the Immigration Appeals Board's 2014 decision to allow undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Attorney General Carl Resin of the District of Columbia said in a statement Friday that the new policy "has ignored many decades of state, federal and international law."
According to the court brief, "The application of all refugees under this federal law should be judged according to the specific information and circumstances, and such a ban violates the main purpose."
In the statement, the attorneys also argued that the policy denying entry to immigrants is hurting the U.S. economy, as they are more likely to be entrepreneurs and that they "provide the necessary labour."
Acting Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to no longer provide shelter to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"People who have been forced to leave their country due to persecution or fear of membership or political opinions in race, religion, nationality or certain social groups can be given shelter," Sessions said in his policy announcement on June 11.
Refugee shelters are never meant to be the solution to all problems - even all the deadly problems - that people face every day around the world.
The death toll has doubled in the wake of efforts to save the living and the dead in Palu.
The situation was terrible for the survivors.
"Risa Kusuma, 35, at the Palu city shelter, asked her fever-stricken child to comfort her," it was very worrisome.
"An ambulance is coming in every minute.
Clear water is not available."
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes in an effort to find what was found in the water.
Hundreds of people were injured and the crowd was rising in hospitals damaged by a 7.5-magnitude quake.
Some of the injured, including Duo Harris, who fractured his back and shoulder bones, have been kept outside the Palu Army Hospital, undergoing treatment under the sky due to the strong subsequent tremors.
She cried when she was in a five-storey hotel room with his wife and daughter to talk about the shock of the earthquake.
"I didn't have time to save my life.
"I think I was stuck in the middle of a broken wall," Harris told reporters, adding that they had come to the city for a wedding ceremony.
"I can hear my wife screaming for help, then silence."
I don't know what happened to me or my kids.
I hope they are safe."
The U.S. ambassador to China has accused China of "disgusting" through "propaganda advertising."
Citing the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, a government Chinese newspaper released a four-page ad in the U.S. daily, accusing China's U.S. ambassador of using American press to campaign against Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the paid supplement of the largest Chinese daily Des Mains Register in Iowa, and accused China of trying to interfere in the November 6 U.S. Congress election, China denied the allegations.
Trump accused Beijing of trying to meddle in the US election, which U.S. officials said was a new attempt by Washington to pressure China.
It is normal for the foreign government to advertise trade, but Beijing and Washington have now embarked on a trade war that has resulted in the increase in tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and U.S. experts say China's retaliatory tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were designed to harm exporters in states like Iowa who supported Trump's Republican Party.
China's U.S. ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa, Terry Branstad, who is a major exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and traders.
Brenstad said in an article in Sunday's Des Mines Register that China "has now doubled that barbarism with objective advertising in our own free press."
"The Chinese government is taking advantage of the unethical benefits of American freedom of speech and the cherished history of the free press in promoting this propaganda by advertising payments to the Des Mines Register," said Brenstad.
"On the other hand, in the newsstand on Beijing's street, you will find limited opposition voices and you will not be able to see the true reflection of the differences that the Chinese people may have about China's worrying economic path, because the media here is at the behest of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that his writings "refused to print a major newspaper in China", although he did not mention the name of the newspaper.
Republicans want to keep women's voters away before midterms in the Kakat Kavanaugh controversy, analysts warn.
In the face of multiple allegations of sexual assault, many leading Republicans have stood by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, and as he hides, analysts have warned that they will see an adverse reaction from women, especially in the upcoming midterm elections.
The excitement around the issue has finally subsided, and it appears that most Republicans are already looking to go public with the vote.
In an article published Saturday, Grant Rihar, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse's Maxwell School, told The Hill, "They can't come back in any way."
Mr Rihar said there were doubts about whether the pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) would calm the angry voters at the last minute for an FBI investigation.
"Women should not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow and even in November," said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the Progressive Moveon Group, according to the Washington DC newspaper.
Demonstrators chanted "November is coming!" during protests in the Senate Hallway on Friday morning while Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee over Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of late Dr. Christine Blazi Ford. Mike said.
Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site: "Democratic enthusiasm and inspiration will be the past.
"People say there's a lot more; it's true.
But it can be even more, especially among the dominating female voters in the suburbs and among young voters aged 18 to 29, who often don’t vote because they don’t like the president.”
Even before the Supreme Court-nominated candidate was put to public testimony on the allegations of sexual assault against Ford, analysts suggested that there could be adverse consequences if Republicans proceed with the approval.
"It has become a complex issue for the GOP," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just about whether it's the vote of the committee or the final vote of the committee or whether it's about how the Republicans took it and how they used it," Proprioris USA Group, which supports Democrats in the vote, its director Guy Seychelles told the news channel.
However, given the testimony of Fords and Kavanaugh, Americans seem to be a bit hesitant about who to trust, with opinions weighing heavily on the next one.
According to a new survey conducted by C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire, 41 percent of respondents believed in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believed in Kavanaugh.
More than 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was probably lying, and only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
Following the press conference, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations of Ford and Deborah Ramirez, at least another complainant, according to the Guardian report.
Caucasian Ford testified before the judicial committee last week that he was harassed by Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Kamat Ramirez alleged that Supreme Court Namini showed her genitals at a party while studying in Yale in the 1980s.
Google and Facebook are planning to launch a new Internet for the inventors of the World Wide Web to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project in the technology legend, Inrapt, is a company that will create the Berners-Leer open source platform Solid.
Solid users have the right to choose where their data will be stored and to which information people will be allowed to access.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the real purpose of Indrapt was "global domination."
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
This app allows everyone to create a P&D or "Personal Online Data Store" using Solid's technology.
It may include contact lists, two-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all in the same browser and get at the same time.
The unique thing about personal online data store is that it completely depends on the user - who can access any type of information.
The company has been named "Personal Empowerment through Data."
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, Inrapt's idea will help bring resources, processes, and appropriate skills to get everyone's solids.
The company is currently a security platform purchased by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, with some contracted on-stuff developers and a team of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the existing tools on Inrapt's website.
Bateman Berners-Lee said he and his team "are not talking about whether Facebook and Google will launch any complete change where all their business models will be completely changed overnight."
"We don't ask for permission from them."
In a post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrapt's "purpose is to provide commercial fuel and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on solids."
He radically changed the internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Berners-Lee Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1994.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has emerged as a strong voice in the net neutrality debate.
He will also be the founder and director of the Berners-Lee World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm optimistic about the future of the web," said Berners-Lee.
Bernhard Van: Celebrating the Victoria Cross Clarice of the First World War
He is the only priest in the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross during World War I as a warrior.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend Bernard Van won the award on 29 September 1918 during the invasion of Belengalis and Lehancott.
However, he was killed four days later by a assailant and he never knew that he had received the highest British military honor.
On Saturday, two of his grandsons unveiled his memorial at a parade in Rusden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was "extraordinary significance" that the monument was being unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's death.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van "led his battalion through the thick fog and heavy shelling of the field and machine guns" at the time of de Saint-Continental Canal Per<0xC3><0xB3>n.
After that, he ran to the firing line and led the line with "maximum courage" and simply sang a field song and punched three enemies.
On October 4, 1918, Lt. Col. Van was killed by a German attacker - just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions were “something I could never have done and which is tremendously respectful.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Van Kuchkowj, were awarded the wreath, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said he was "deeply honored to be a part of the parade" and added that "a true heroic hero is being displayed in support of a lot of people."
Fans of MMA stayed up all night to watch the 206 Bellotto, but instead they got the Peppa Pig.
Imagine that you've been up all night to watch a great bettor 206 and the main event is not shown.
The original card of the bill received from San Juan San Jose had 13 fights, including six, and was shown live throughout the night on Channel 5 in the UK.
Early in the morning, while Guardiola Moussaki and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, the coverage changed to Peppa Pig and shocked the UK audience.
They were up early in the morning, especially for this fight, so some people got angry.
One fan on Twitter described the conversion of a children's cartoon as "a kind of dirty joke."
In response to a question on the broadcast, Belato's senior vice president Dave Schwarz said it was "not appropriate to show such shows as per government rules at 6 a.m. that they were forced to change the children's cartoons."
"Papa the pig," "Yes."
Scott Cocker, president of Bellatore, said he would work on a timetable for UK visitors in the future.
"Maybe we can fix it during the replay," Cocker said.
"But now there's six in the morning and our Sunday, we can't do that until Monday."
But we are working on it.
Trust me, when it's switched on, there's a lot of messages coming up every time and they weren't very friendly.
While we were trying to fix it, we thought it might be a technical error.
But no, it was a government issue.
I promise this won't happen next time.
We're going to cut it down to five fights instead of six - just as we usually do - the opposite has happened in an attempt to overdo the fans.
It's an unfortunate situation."
The Dessert Island Disc: Tom Daly suffers from "innocentness" due to sex.
Olympic diver Tom Daly says that he was suffering from depression when he was growing up - but that inspired him to succeed.
The 24-year-old says he didn't go to secondary school until he realized that "not everyone is like me."
While speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island disc presented by Lockheed Lauren Lavern, he said that he spoke about gay rights in providing "hope" to others.
He also said that after the birth of the child, his thinking about winning the Olympics has decreased.
Chris Christie Young, a regular presenter for the event, took several months off due to illness.
Appearing as a social dissident at the first event of Lovelace, Dell said he felt "smaller" than everyone else, because "the choice of boys and girls was not socially acceptable."
He said: “Till today, it remains real to feel that small and isolated that has given me the strength and determination to succeed.”
He said he wanted to prove himself as "something" so that everyone would know about his sexuality so that he wouldn't be disappointed.
The high profile LGBT campaigner, who won a bronze medal at the two-time Olympic Games, has used his presence to appeal to more countries to recognize homosexuality at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia.
He said he opened his mouth because he felt lucky to live in public without complicity and wanted to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion said he fell in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lans Black, whom he met in 2013 - "surprised me."
Dell was married to this Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than him. He said that age gap was not a problem.
He went to the Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, saying it was difficult to find someone who had seen so much ups and downs in life.
The couple gave birth to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily in June, and Daley said his "whole outlook" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, I would say, 'I have to win a gold medal'.
"To be honest, there's something bigger than the Olympic gold medal.
"Robbie is my Olympic gold medalist."
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at the age of 40.
Dayley said her father never admitted that she was going to die and that she eventually asked if their tickets for London 2012 had been confirmed - because she wanted to be in the first row.
“I never even said ‘you won’t be able to sit in the first row’,” he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and until he gave up his last breath and died and I did not confess that he was invincible," she said.
He participated in the 2012 Summer Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"That's been my dream all my life - to dive into the Olympics in front of my audience, there's nothing better," he said.
It also inspired her choice of her first song - Heather Small's Proud - which resonated with her in preparation for the Olympics and which still gnaws at her.

Michaelson, who is in off-form, will sit on a bench at Saturday's Rider Cup.
American Phil Michelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to return his form if he doesn't want to make it an unfortunate milestone.
McClellan, who plays in this biennial event for a record 12 times, had to sit on the bench on Saturday at Foreball and Foursome instead of Captain Jim Furick.
Instead of being at the center of the game, which he used to play in the United States, this five-time major winner has spent the day working as a cheerleader and busy renovating his own game in the range.
While not always comfortable among drivers at the top of their careers, this 48-year-old is not suitable for the Tight le Golf National Course, where the taller Raf often messes up the long shot.
If the course itself isn't bad enough, Michelson, in the No. 9 match, is facing British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has won four of their matches this week by pairing up with Rookie Tommy Fleetwood.
If Americans, who are down four points at the start of 12 singles matches, can start well, Michelson's match can prove to be important.
Fukushima had a lot of confidence in him, but he didn't have much to say.
"Today, I've fully understood my Gemini, put my hand on my shoulder and said that he's ready for tomorrow," said Furick.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's been a big part of the team and has done a lot in the past and this week.
I didn't expect him to play two games.
I had hoped for more, but that's what happened and that's how we thought to move forward.
He wants to get out on the field, just like everyone else.”
Michaelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record of most riders in Sunday's game.
It can end up in a rider's cup career that doesn't even go through the edge of his personal record.
McClellan has 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven halfs in his clutches, although Furrick says his presence brightens the team.
"He's a funny guy, he's funny, he's smart, he likes to make people angry, he's like being in a team room and he's a great guy," he said.
"I think the new players had a lot of fun playing with him, too, this week, which I really enjoyed watching.
He gives so much more than just a game."
Captain Thomas Bjorn of Europe knows that the big lead can also disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that even if the rider with a larger lead drops to the singles on the last day of the racer's cup, an uncomfortable situation can arise.
Dane debuted in 1997 in Valderam, where the Savvy Ballesteros-led team secured five points for the Americans, but somehow won the finishing line at 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 in the narrowest margin.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderam; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderam, where we won, but by no means," said Bjorn, who is seen in the film, winning 5-3 in class on Friday and yesterday at Le Golf National, 10-6.
History will show me and the team that it's not over yet.
Let's start tomorrow with full of enthusiasm.
Get on the field and do the right thing.
It doesn't end until the point is reached on the board.
One of our goals is to win the trophy, and that's where we'll have our bird's eye.
I have always said that I look at 12 of my team players, but we are also very aware of who we are on the other side - the best player in the world."
"I am happy with the work our players have done in the tough golf course. "I will never be over-confident about it.
Tomorrow is a different battle.
Personal performance will come to the fore tomorrow, and that's a different thing.
It's great to be with a partner when everything goes well, but when you're alone on the field, your abilities as a golfer are fully tested.
This message needs to reach out to all the players, who will have to give the best tomorrow.
This time, you have to leave your partner and go ahead and get the best out of it.”
On the other hand, opponents Jim Furick will keep an eye on so that the players can play better in person than what they have played as a team, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have scored three points out of four points.
As part of the "miracles in the day" in Europe and the Brooklyn winning team, Furrick himself experienced dramatic change on the last day.
When asked about how captain Ben Kransch inspired his players before he dropped on the last day of 1999, he said, "I remember every word."
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you'll want to get rid of getting started as quickly as Brooklyn and Medina."
When the game is pushed to one side, there is a lot of pressure on the middle-side matches.
We will make the line-up according to that and drop the boys as we thought, in fact, we are going to do some magic tomorrow."
Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter have been given the task of leading Thomas against top-order Europeans. He will face Rory McLaurrow in his opening match.
"I have arranged this team in this order, because in my opinion it will cover everything," Bjorn said of the selection of his singles.
Germany's new warship has been suspended again.
According to local media reports, T was supposed to be launched in 2014 with the newest team of the German Navy to replace the previous Cold War-era warships, but it won't be until at least next year due to faulty systems and snobbing costs.
The new Baden-Württemberg-class frigate's first ship "Rhineland-False" has been suspended until the first half of 2019, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project was in trouble due to post-delivery issues.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigate.
They are said to have powerful cannons, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, such as reducated radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include long maintenance periods - it will be possible to deploy new frigates for a maximum of two years away from the country's port.
Whatever the case, the continued delay means that the state-of-the-art warships - which are supposed to help Germany demonstrate energy abroad - will become obsolete by the time it goes down in the water, news from Die Jett.
The unfortunate F125 frigate came under the headline last year, when the German Navy sent back the Humber's Bloom and Vos Shipyard, refusing to launch the formal navigation ship.
This is the first time a ship has been sent back to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Very little is known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of important "software and hardware errors" that would make the ship in battle unmanageable.
The piles of software are particularly important, as Baden-Württemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - which is half of the manpower of the old Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it was found that the ship was over-loaded which would reduce its performance and create obstacles in the way of adding future upgrades to the Navy.
The 7,000-tonne "Rhinland-Plas" is thought to be twice as heavy as the same class of ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
From the initial level of 2.2 billion pounds to surprisingly 3.1 billion pounds ($3.6 billion).
The new frigates have become more important in the recent context of Germany's warning of shrinking naval power.
Hans-Peter Bertels, the head of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted earlier this year that the navy was "running out its appropriate ship of deployment."
The official said the problem had widened over time, as no replacement ships were brought to replace the old ships that had been cancelled.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class ships were able to join the Navy.
Listen to the national trust in the secret life of bats.
New research is being carried out in an estate in the Scottish Hills to find out how bats use groundnuts in search of food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of this unique flying mammal and help in future conservation activities.
Scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will continue their research on common and soprano pimples, as well as the Dobenton bats at the Inaugurative Garden of Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be set up at important places around the area to track the activity of the bats throughout the entire season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct ongoing surveys using portable detectors.
All recordings will be analysed by expert experts to determine the frequency of the bat call and what species are doing.
After that, a landscape map and report will be created to create detailed landscape-scale images of their behavior.
NTS' Nature Conservation Consultant Rob hopes that the results will reveal which areas of residence are most important to the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of grasslands and how to protect the forest for bats and other related species.
Over the last century, the number of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has decreased significantly.
They are at risk for building buildings and developmental work that damage their sleeping space and habitat.
Wind-based turbines and lighting can also be at risk, as can be from some chemicals in flypapers and building materials, as well as from pet cats.
The mouse isn't really blind.
However, their ears are more effective than their eyes when it comes to hunting at night due to hunting habits.
They use an advanced echo-location technique to identify hazards and obstacles along the way.
The NTS, which is responsible for maintaining more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, has given importance to bats.
There are ten trained specialists in Aqeedah, who regularly conduct surveys, visit dormitories, and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The company has also set up Scotland's first and only dedicated bat conservation sites in the Three Estates of Dumfries and Gallo, where eight of Scotland's ten bat species reside.
David Thompson, the estate manager, said the estate is an ideal area for bats.
"There's a good area for the three bats here," he said.
"There are old buildings here, there are many old trees and all have good residences.
But much more about bats is still unknown, so what we do here and elsewhere will help us understand more about what they need to survive."
He stressed the importance of knowing the presence of bats before maintaining the property, as it could unintentionally destroy 400 female and child bats, and wipe out the entire local bat numbers.
It is illegal to kill, harass or harass wild animals and destroy their habitat.
The Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, Elizabeth Ferrell, has encouraged the public to help.
He said: “We still have a lot to learn about bats and we don’t know much about how many species live.”
Rolando has denied allegations of rape and lawyers are going to file a lawsuit against the German newspaper.
Accusing him of rape, Khashoggi called it "fake news" and said that people "want to increase their identity" by naming him.
His lawyers are ready to file a lawsuit against German news magazine Der Spiegel, who made the allegation public.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward have been accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mawrga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Accusing him of giving him $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, the Dor Spiegel report said on Friday.
Ronaldo, 33, described the report as "fake news" while talking to his 142 million followers on his Instagram live video hours after the claim came to light.
She said, "No, no, no.
"What they said today is false news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They want to improve their reputation by using my name."
It's common practice.
They want to be known by my name, but it's part of their livelihood.
"I'm a happy guy and everything is going well," the player said with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to file a lawsuit against Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they call an "unqualified report to be taken as suspicious in terms of privacy."
Lawyer Christian Shertz said the player would have to seek compensation "for moral damage in accordance with the importance of the violation, which is perhaps one of the most serious abuses of personal rights in recent times."
The alleged incident took place in a suite of Pams Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
According to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada, Ronaldo and Mayorga go to the player's house after meeting him at a nightclub, where he raped her as an asexually.
Mr Mayerga claimed that Ronaldo pleaded after the incident and told him that he was disappointed for "99 percent" "good people", "one percent."
The documents claimed that Ronaldo had confirmed that he had had sexual intercourse, but that it was consensual.
Kyoto Myrga also claimed that he went to the police and took pictures of his injuries to the hospital, but later agreed to settle outside the court, as he was "fear of retribution" and "fear of being humiliated in public."
The 34-year-old said she is now seeking to revive the settlement as she is mentally disturbed by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was in the middle of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the crime and joined Italy's famous club Juve in a $100 million deal this summer.
Brexit: UK 'will regret forever' losing its position as a car manufacturer
Commerce Minister Greg Clark said the UK would "forever regret" if it lost its position as the world's first car maker after Brexit.
He also said that it was "surprised" that the UK Toyota told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, they would temporarily stop production at their factory in Bernston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker has said that people could lose their jobs due to the delay in the border crossing if Brexit is not signed.
The factory at Bournestone, which manufactures Toyota Oris and Avenis, produced about 150,000 cars last year, about 90 percent of which have been exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our factory may stop,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota Managing Director at Bournestone.
The UK's other carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concerns about leaving the European Union without a deal on how cross-border trade will be conducted.
For example, BMW said they would shut down their mini plant in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
One of the key concerns that car manufacturers say is the risk of supply chains in case of a no-deal Brexit.
The Toyota production line runs on a "just-in-time" basis, for both the UK and the EU, the shipments for the ordered vehicle come in a volume every 37 minutes from suppliers.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruptions at the border, which could lead to delays in supply and a crisis of control.
The company said it was not possible to keep more than a day's worth of inventory in the Toyota Derbyshire plant, which could lead to the closure of production.
Mr Clarke said Theresa May's checkers plan for future relationships with the EU was "appropriately formulated to avoid such checks on the border."
“We need a deal. We want to make the best deal that will not only sustain success, but also make it possible to enjoy the potential for future improvements,” he told BBC Radio 4 today.
"Not only Toyota, but other manufacturers are also proving that it is very important to continue the successful delivery of the supply chain."
Toyota is unable to say how long production will be stopped, but they have warned that additional costs in the long run will reduce the factory's competitiveness and could result in many jobs being lost.
Pete Suvalaris, who has been working at the unit for 24 years in Burnston, said members of the unit are increasingly concerned: “Once these things are gone in my experience, they don’t come back.”
A government spokesman said: “We need to have a specific and credible plan for the future relationship with the EU.”
The White House has said that Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed.
The White House said on Sunday that a high-level meeting with Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed "another week" amid tensions over the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosstein has overseen the work of Robert Mueller, a special counsel investigating Russia's interference in the election, the connection between Trump's aide and Russia, and the possible obstruction of the president's trial.
There have been months of speculation in Washington over whether Trump will sack the deputy attorney general and whether Mueller's independence will be questioned.
Earlier this month, the New York Times discussed the use of secret mics to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, in the wake of reports that he was about to step down, he went to the White House on Monday.
Instead of announcing a meeting with Trump on Thursday, Trump was then in the UN office in New York.
Trump said he "wouldn't like" Rosstein to be fired, but the meeting was postponed to avoid hearings by both Dr. Christine Blazee Ford, one of Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of sexual misconduct against him.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's allegations, which further delayed the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Regarding his meeting with Rosstein, he said: "No date has been fixed, it could happen this week, it could be delayed by another week for all the other current Supreme Court issues."
Let's face it and I always want to tell the media."
Some journalists will oppose the statement. Sanders has not held any press briefings at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked the reason.
Chuck Sanders said that the reason not to keep briefings is not for "showing people" to journalists, although he said: "I don't deny that they've done a thing to show people."
He also suggested an increase in direct contact between Trump and the press.
"The current president has more questions than any previous president," he said without mentioning any evidence: "We have judged that number."
"But if the media gets a chance to directly question the president of the United States, it's better to talk to me than talk to me," Sanders said.
We try very hard to do this and over the last few weeks you have seen us do it and it is going to take place to talk directly to the President of the United States instead of the press briefing.”
Trump regularly receives questions when he leaves the White House or attends opening sessions or press conferences with prominent guests.
There is very little single press conference.
This week in New York City, the president probably showed why, doing unplanned work and sometimes having a bizarre presence in front of the journalist's team.
Health Minister NHS Scotland wrote a letter to EU workers in Scotland on fears of Brexit.
The Health Minister expressed his gratitude to the EU workers working at the NHS in Scotland and expressed his desire to remain in the post-Brexit period.
Jean Freeman sent a letter to MSP, less than six months before leaving the UK.
The Scottish Government has already promised EU citizens to meet the cost of the Settled Status Application to work in the country's government services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: Talks between the UK and the EU on Brexit continue throughout the summer, which is expected to have consequences this autumn.
However, the UK government is also preparing for a possible no-deal situation.
I know you are all going through a difficult time.
For this reason, I want to remind you once again how valuable to me is the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Fellows from across the European Union and beyond have come up with valuable experiences and skills that have strengthened and improved health care and benefitted patients and our community.
Scotland is your own country and we want you to stay here."
Christian is undergoing emergency surgery after he suffered a head injury.
According to Mike Organ, Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after being hit in the head in a 31-27 defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday.
Rod Reid, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the halftime.
"He came on the sideline and became a bit of a nuisance," said Ricky Reid.
The trainers and medical staff gave him oxygen on the sideline and he was later brought back for further testing.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Vanderbilt was out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center this time.
Harris added that "no details of the type/type of injury are known yet" and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when it hit.
A second-year student wearing a red shirt after his transfer from Illinois is playing the first season with Ebercrombie, Tennessee State.
He had five total tackles on Saturday before coming out of the game, with a total of 18 tackles this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay more stamp duty when buying a property in the UK.
Under the Tory scheme, foreign buyers will have to pay more stamp duty when they buy new property in the UK and the extra money will be spent on helping the homeless.
The move will ease the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters.
The increase in stamp duty will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury expects to raise revenues by up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to support the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have to pay more stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK - and this extra money will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will ease the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters while providing housing at a more affordable price and targeting high-income earners.
The increase in stamp duty will be applicable to individuals and organizations that do not pay taxes in the UK, and additional funds will be used by the government to help the homeless.
Surcharges - which, in addition to the current stamp duty, were imposed at a higher rate in a second home and a rented house two years ago, could be more than three percent.
The Treasury expects to increase revenues by up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of London's newly created total assets are purchased by residents outside the UK, for which prices have risen and first housing has made the situation more difficult for buyers.
Most of the elite regions of the country - especially the capital - are becoming "unknown cities" in the crowd of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy came weeks after the young generation called for a reduction in the Boris Johnson stamp duty to help them buy their first home.
He accused major construction companies of increasing property prices by not buying land and not using it, and urged Mrs May to cancel the affordable house quota to solve Britain's "residence problem."
Mr. Corbyn announced an interesting series of housing reform proposals, including rent control and an end to "no-fault" evictions.
He wants to give the council more power to build a new house.
Ms May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my prime ministership to restoring the British dream - which is that life should be better for everyone of the new generation.
It's the market and it's the market for broken homes.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life.
However, it may not be right that foreign and foreign private companies that do not live in the UK will buy property as easily as hard-working British residents.
Many people dream of owning a house, and the problem of homelessness remains very real.
Jack Ross: 'My last dream is to take over Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "final ambition" is to become Scotland's manager some day in the future.
This 42-year-old Scottish resident is currently enjoying the challenge of restoring the Northeastern club, who are now third in League One, three points behind the first team.
He returned to St. Mary's in the Scottish Premiership last season and moved to the Stadium of Light this summer.
"I wanted to play for the country as a player.
I got a B-cap and so far," Ross told the BBC Scotland Sports Ground.
"But I grew up watching Scotland's game at Hampden with my father as a child and it always pulls me back.
This opportunity can come only if I succeed in running the club.”
Ross' predecessors as manager of Cousins Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Mayes, Sam Allardis, Martin O'Neill, Ryan Ken, Gus Poet and Paulo de Canoe.
The former Aloe Athletic boss said he did not feel disappointed by rejecting the offer of the established names of big clubs such as Burnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The measure of success for me at the moment will be 'Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'
"Because of the structure and facilities at the club, it is undoubtedly worthy of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not that easy to get there, but I'll probably see myself as successful if I can bring the club back there."
Ross's managerial life span is currently only three years after having 15 months as an assistant boss at Dumbledore and Hart's coaching staff.
He then helped Alok recover from the downfall to the third level and convert St. Mirren from the downfall gate to the championship title winner the next season.
Ross said that he is now feeling more comfortable here than in his career playing the Clyde, Hartalpool, Falcarc, St. Mirren and Hamilton.
“It was probably a real milestone,” he recalled, recalling that he took charge of Aloe.
"I really believed that management is better for me than sports.
It sounds strange to hear it because I did it right, lived a whole life from it, and enjoyed some success.
But it's hard to play
You have to go through a lot of things every week.
I still feel the same way about work pressure, but the management seems to be right.
I've always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it, it's the most comfortable thing on my own skin in my entire adult life."
You can listen to the full interview on Sunday, September 30 in SportsGround, Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST.
According to the survey, Saturday afternoon at 5.30 pm is the most ideal for pints.
Summer heatwaves have increased crowds in Britain's smoked pubs, but have put pressure on the restaurant chain.
Sales of pubs and bars rose by 2.7 percent in July - but restaurant finance collections fell by 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, a business consultant at CGA, who compiled the figures, said: "The unforeseen sunshine and England's unanticipated long participation in the World Cup would mean that the same trend will continue in July as in June last year, when the sales of pubs have increased by 2.8 percent and the sales of restaurants have declined.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant business in June has worsened in July.
The main pubs and bars of beverage beverages have done very well so far, and the sales of restaurants have been as bad.
Food major pubs are also suffering from heat losses, but did not sell them down like restaurants.
It seems like people are just going out for a drink.
The sales of beverages in pubs and bars increased by 6.6 percent this month, with food sales down by three percent.”
Paul Newman of Retirement and Hospitality Analyst RSM said: “The end of April trend still continues.
The weather and the impact of major social or sports events are the most significant when it comes to sales outside the home market.
It should come as no surprise that restaurant groups will be in a difficult situation, but this 4.8 percent drop on sales every year will be particularly painful.
The long and hot summer may not come at the worst for the food major operators, and the soft weather in August will tell time if it will bring some relief."
In July, the total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent, reflecting a decline in sales at brand roll-out.

One in every five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
The survey revealed that one in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
The survey showed an increase in the number of "nail insta" pages among the 20,000 secondary school students.
News reports have raised fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty-five percent of students say they have a "main" account to show their parents.
One in five children—some of them just 11 years old—are creating a social media account hidden from adults.
According to a survey of 20,000 secondary school students, the site Instagram, a photo sharing site, has shown a trend of rapid growth.
News reports have raised fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty-five percent of students said they had a transparent "main" account to show their parents, as well as a hidden one.
A 13-year-old mother, who saw the hidden site of her 13-year-old daughter, saw a teenager calling others "rape me."
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headteachers Conference (HMC) found that between 11 and 18 years of age, 40 percent had two profiles, half of whom admitted to having a secret account.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s thoughtful that so many teenagers are tempted to create places online that parents and teachers can’t find.”
Doyle will be the "Voice for Athletes" on the Scottish Athletic Board.
Elidh Doyle has been elected a member of the Scottish Athletics Board as an executive director at the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle, Scotland's most successful track and field athlete and chairman, Ian Beatty, described the move as a great opportunity for sports directors to benefit from his extensive experience at the international level over the past decade.
"Elizabeth has a lot of respect across the Scottish, UK and world athletics community, and we are sure that bringing him to Scotland's athletics board will greatly benefit," he said.
Doyle said: “I’m interested in working as a voice for athletes and I’m hopeful that I can really help Scotland’s sport and take it forward.”
The American, who won four Olympic gold medals in Atlanta in 1996, including 200 metres and 400 metres, and is now a regular BBC scholar, has stopped walking after one of its most transient ischemic attacks.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctor will tell you how well I can recover.
It was hard work, but now I've learned to walk again, and I've started exercising again!
Thank you for the inspirational message!"
The internet is more confusing than mother and cow in breast pump advertising.
A breast pump company has divided the internet's opinion with an advertisement that compares baby mothers to milking cows.
To mark the inauguration of what is called the "world's first noiselessly dressed breast pump," consumer technology company LV has released a funny music video advertisement to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump gives to modern mothers.
Four of the four true mothers are dancing with a song running a hare-filled cow, which includes the lyrics: "Yes, I bless my own milk, but I don't have a tail" and "If anyone sees it, these are no cattle bunnies, these are my breasts."
The chorus continues: “Pump, pump, feed the children, pump, feed the milk of my girlfriends.”
However, the ad, which was released on the company's Facebook page, has sparked controversy online.
The video received mixed response from the audience in 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. Many say it highlights the "fear" of the dairy industry.
"The use of cow in advertising of this product is a very bad decision.
They, like us, need to get pregnant and give birth, the difference is that within a few days of birth, their babies are stolen from them," one wrote.
The LV breast pump is beautifully placed inside any nursing bra (LV/M)
Another commented: "Obviously, it's disappointing for both mother and child.
But why should they not be used in the advertising of breast pumps for mothers who keep their children in close proximity?"
Another said: "Extremely uncomfortable advertising."
While others stand by the ad, a woman admits that the song is her "pleasant."
"I think it's a great idea.
If I had breast milk, I would have taken one too.
He looks like a cow when he's pumping.
It's a bit crazy about advertising, but I've taken it well.
"It's an innovative product," one wrote.
Another commented: “It’s a humorous ad targeting mothers who (often at their workplace or in the toilet) pump and think of themselves as “crazy.”
This advertisement does not praise or criticise the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women say they all danced with the pump hidden in their bra.
Advertising is based on the idea that many women feel like a cow while pumping their breasts.
Although the LV pump is completely noiseless, it does not have its or tube and fits nicely into the nursing bra, which gives women the freedom to walk, keep the baby in the lap and even get out during the pumping.
Anna Ballerin, mother’s partner and ECD, said: “LV pumps are a revolutionary product that should start bravely and vigorously.
Drawing parallel images of young women and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and all its challenges in the spotlight, in an entertaining and related way, revealing the incredible feeling of release that the new pump will bring.
The LV pump is not in the news for the first time.

Hundreds of migrant children have been taken to a tent camp along the Texas border.
The number of detained migrant children has increased, although the monthly border crossings remain relatively unchanged, as the Trump administration's strict rules and policies have made it more difficult to keep children to their sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves are afraid to lose the possibility of staying in their own country by claiming immigrants and children without papers.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to submit fingerprints, and the information would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs enforcement official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of orphaned children.
The agency later said that 70 per cent of those arrested had no past criminal history.
About 80 per cent of the sponsor's family members are in the country illegally and a large part of them are witty criminals.
"We're still looking for them," said Nyster Albens.
In an effort to bring children back to society more quickly, officials introduced some new rules that include being produced before the court within a month of the arrest, which was 60 days earlier, shelter workers said.
Many of them will appear before the immigration judge through video conference calls rather than in person during their trial for legal status.
Those who are considered ineligible for relief will be promptly evicted.
According to shelter shelter staff and reports from the system in recent months, the more days children are in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent incidents or attempts to escape.
Supporters say these concerns are more acute in large centres such as Toronto, where children are more likely to be overlooked, due to their size.
They also said that if children are not mentally prepared or moved to the center without having enough time to say goodbye to friends, many people can increase the trauma so that they are already suffering.
The U.S., French and Turkish "captive forces" have been asked to leave Syria immediately.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Molaym called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country has been at war for eight years.
Chowk Moyalem, who at the same time deputy prime minister of the country, said foreign forces are illegally on the ground in the country on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "we will take appropriate measures."
"They have to leave now without conditions," he told the council.
Moyalem stressed that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been forced to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue its "war on terrorism" and "illegal foreign presence" until all Syrian territory was cleared.
There are about 2,000 US troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
When asked about refugees, Moalem said the situation was conducive for them to return and he blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that prompted refugees to stay away.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help in this repatriation," he said.
"They're talking about the whole human race"
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction assistance will be provided to Syria until a political agreement is reached to end the war between Assad and the opposition.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to build a buffer zone at Idlib's last major rebel base provides an opportunity to move forward through political negotiations.
The Russia-Turkish agreement has prevented a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the area, where three million people live.
However, Moyalem insists that the agreement has a "clear deadline" and hopes that the military action will work against jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who will be "delivered."
United Nations Ambassador to the United Nations Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meeting of a new committee comprising members of the government and opposition parties to draft post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moyalem said the Syrian government's participation in the committee should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution," and he warned against undue interference.
Why Trump won the second round.
In this argument, Trump will win the 2020 re-election, as a large number of liberals are likely to expect that his presidency will end prematurely due to impeachment and scandal.
This will undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end of any president!"
So far, there is no sign of changing the audience's opinion.
Since 2014, the prime-time rating on CNN has more than doubled to about 1.05 million, and in the case of MSNBC it has almost tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News' average prime-time audience has risen from 1.7 million last year to about 2.4 million, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Mado Show" tops the ratings with about 3.5 million viewers on the big news night.
Regarding a cabinet secretary who became president after the destruction of the Capitol in an attack on the Capitol, Blue Ber, the director of the ABC drama "Dedicated Survivor", said, "It's a fire that's attracting people, because it's beyond our comprehension."

In the mid-term elections, money from outside has come in like floodwaters.
It's no surprise that money is flying in Pennsylvania's 17th vote, as two candidates are fighting for a single seat in the congressional district's reorganization.
The recently refurbished downtown Pittsburgh District Pitts are bringing Democratic Representative Conor Lamb to the fight - who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Cabot Lamb is fighting against Republican Keith Rothfas, who is currently representing the 12th District of Old Pennsylvania, many of which are part of the new 17th District.
In January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the old districts were constitutionally inaccurately formatted in favor of Republicans, causing the map to be redrawn.
The fight in the new 17th District has resulted in a competition between the main parties' finance branch, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb made his debut in March after winning a nominal margin in a widely publicized special election in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat has been held by Republicans for more than a decade, with President Donald Trump winning 20 points in the district.
Political leaders are pushing the Democrats a little bit.
El Salvador sentenced to death for supporting U.S.-China, later withdrew
Diplomats have noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, retreating a little from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama, but later the partners removed the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month that "the recent decision to no longer recognise Taiwan" led to the decision by the Department of State to bring back American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama.
But only El Salvador, who received nearly $140 million in American aid in 2017 in the field of drug control, development and economic assistance, was convicted.
The proposed punishment, which included cutting financial aid and certain visa restrictions, could have been painful for this Central American country due to its high unemployment and murder rates.
With the progress of the House internal meeting, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity as a measure to prevent the influx of immigrants to the United States last year.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made it clear they wanted to hold the conference, effectively ending El Salvador's chances of a sentence.
Vice President Mike Pence will address the conference, which is scheduled to be held in mid-October, so that the administration will send a message of import.
The U.S. ambassadors to the United States and three countries returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic quietly without any new strong message or punishment from Washington.
Mr Bolton declined to comment on the statement made by three US officials, including two diplomats who had agreed to discuss internal affairs on the condition of anonymity.
The statement was confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration and he also declined to be named.
Read the history
Robert Mueller's special report on the possible obstruction of Mr. Trump in law, of which there is now sufficient evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller's investigation into whether Mr. Trump had any links with Russia during the election is being turned around.
If the Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to take over, just as he is preparing to go back in front of voters, and eventually with his colleagues, perhaps even before the jury.
There are a lot of things to do, and I'm not saying that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, or his European complement.
We will have a choice of how long this dispute will last for the inhabitants of the two shores of the Atlantic.
In 1938, German officials would have "coupled" against Hitler, unless the West had stopped him and stood beside the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed, and we have had the opportunity to avoid many years of killings.
The course of history often takes such twists, and in this, the overwhelming speed of democracy is sometimes accelerated, sometimes delayed.
Similar trends have also occurred in American history.
What should we do if Mr. Trump sacks Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who decides the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in danger ever since it was published on paper last year, suggesting that he secretly recorded the president's words and speculated about his inability to hold his position.
Mr. Rosenstein said that the news of the Times is false.
"What will happen if the FBI investigation against Brett Kavanaugh, who recently started, is incomplete or unfair - or if he is found to be innocent in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?"
The big question is, will we elect a Congress in the midterm elections that can hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail in this test, democracy will remain in the cold for a long time.
But I don't think we will fail because we have learned from Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was once exiled by the same Nazis who occupied my embassy.
He survived, fled to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to light a Sabbath lamp on a swastika-marked table.

Graham Dorans of the Caucus Rangers hope before the Rapid Vienna fight.
The Rangers will play their own Rapid Vienna on Thursday, having won against the Austrians after a great draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, they will have a good chance of qualifying from the Europa League Group.
Middlefielder Graham Doranus played his first match of the season due to a knee injury in a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes that by relying on these results they can get to a better place.
"This point is very important because Valerial is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We were on the ground with confidence and managed to take a point.
I could have won in the end, but overall, the draw tie seems to be a fair result.
They played well in the first half and our team played well in the second half.
Thursday is another important night on the European stage.
Hopefully, we'll get three points, but it'll be a tough game, because they had a good result in their last game, but I'm sure with the support of the audience we can get positive results.
Last year was not very good, because of my injury and the changes that have taken place in the club, there are elements of a good feeling in the current position.
Our team is also very good and the boys are also having great fun; the training is going on.

Women are losing sleep at night worrying about the savings for retirement.
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had an idea of how to handle it, very few individuals have spoken to their family members about it.
Half of the participants in the survey said they had spoken to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had spoken to their children about it.
"People want a family member to think about them, but they are not taking action for this conversation," said Holly Schneider, Nationwide's vice president of life insurance business.
Know where to start.
Talk to your spouse or spouse and children: If you don’t express your wishes well enough, you won’t be able to prepare your family for your care.
Work with your counselor and your family by keeping in touch to discuss where and how you want to take care of yourself, because determining the cost of your choice is also very important.
Talk to your financial advisor: Your advisor can look for solutions to address these costs.
If your financing choice for long-term care may include a traditional long-term if-care insurance policy, if you have the money - a hybrid cash-priced life insurance policy or self-insurance with your own resources to help with these expenses.
Resolve from your legal documents: Try to stay away from legal battles.
Take a proper health care proxy so that you can nominate a trusted person to oversee your medical care, and so that if you are unable to communicate, the professional may comply with your wishes.
Think of a power of attorney in relation to your property.
Choose a reliable person to make your financial decisions and make sure that your bills are paid properly when you are disabled.

Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, adding that the death toll could rise further.
With communication disconnected, relief workers were unable to report any news from the Dongala Regency area north of Palu, which is close to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people have been rescued after the disaster.
Some important information about Palu and Dongala on the island of Sumatra Sulawesi:
The capital of the state of Central Sulawesi is Palu, which is located at the end of a narrow inlet on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city of C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Dongala is a Regency spread over about 300 km (180 mi) northwest of Sulawesi Island.
This Regency of lower status than the Kingdom of Kingdoms has an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the main sources of economy in the state of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the state of Utah, but most of it is located in Morawali, on the opposite side of the Sulawesi coast.
According to the Disaster Management Agency of Indonesia, Palu and Dongla have been hit by a tsunami several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed about 200 people in Dongala and destroyed hundreds of homes.
There was also a tsunami in 1996 in Chowk Dongale, which killed nine people.
Indonesia is often hit by earthquakes as it is located in the Pacific volcanic region.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have recently occurred:

Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on Friday on Indonesia's Sulawesi island.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication systems have collapsed and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.

Federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in New York.
Federal prosecutors in New York City are seeking the death penalty for Saifullo Saipov, who was involved in a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people.
The complaint alleges that the 30-year-old Saipov, using a home depot rental truck, carried out an attack in October on a bicycle on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, causing cyclists and pedestrians to suffocate.
According to a notice filed in the New York South District praying for the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov was "intentionally" killing eight people and causing "intentional" serious injury.
According to the court documents, both of them are sufficient to execute the death penalty.
A week after the attack, a federal grand jury has charged Saipov with 22 counts of murder, including eight counts of murder, commonly associated with organized crime, including violence and vehicle destruction.
Referring to the way Saipov carried out the "harmful, cruel and deformed" attack, the prosecutors said it needed "sufficient planning and prioritization."
Cicero "Cyphilo Habibulaevich cypov whose family and friends suffered injuries, damage and damage are Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, An-Laura Decat, Darren Drake, Ariel Erliz, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Dana.

New York's Southern District of New York was last executed more than a decade ago.
Khalid Burns was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last execution in a New York federal case was in 1953, against a married couple named Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were accused of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Both of them were hanged on June 19, 1953, while sitting in an electric chair.
Saipov, a resident of Uzbekistan, did not release any regrets, the court reports.
Police said they were happy after the incident.
Saipov told officials that he was inspired by a video of ISIS on the phone at home and was charged with the attack.
Police said they have also asked for the ISIS flag to be placed in their hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the Federal Public Defenders representing Caucasian Cypov, said they were "clearly disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We think that decision making of the search for the death penalty rather than granting the application for life imprisonment will prolong the trauma of the incident among everyone involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's legal team had earlier appealed for the death penalty to be abolished.
Member of Parliament Tory said Nigel Farage should be given the responsibility of discussing Brexit.
Nigel Farage has promised to "integrate the people's forces" at a rally in Tory today.
The former lawyer said the politicians had "touched the heat" from Euroseptics, while Theresa May's own MP said she should be given the responsibility to negotiate with the EU.
Conservative leader Peter sister said at a rally in Birmingham that if Mr. Farage had been Brexit secretary, the UK would have already been "out of the EU."
However, the ice cream that Mrs May is eating to keep her deeply divided office-bearers in one place has become clear once again, when she took part in another anti-Brexit protest in the anti-Brexit city of Tories.
One of the most important of these Brexit-supporters is eating ice cream to keep the checkers' deal right between the anti-Brexit and the EU's attack.
His allies insisted that despite opposition, he would make a deal with Brussels - and force Euroseptics and Labour - to choose between his package and "disorder."
His sister, Mr. Solihale, told the Live Mins Live rally that she wanted "check checkers."
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be made a colleague and given the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have come out,” he said.
Valinboro's MP added: "I will support Brexit, but Chuck checkers are needed."
He told his opponents in Yue: “We did not wage war to live in conformity.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
After the 2016 vote, Mr. Dumbledore ruled out the possibility of changing the opinion of the people. The idea that the British people want to change their views is completely untrue.
Andre Jenkins, a Tory Brexit supporter, was also at the rally, who told reporters: “That’s all I want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Checkers are disliked by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it. Our team of people and activists also disliked those who have brought us here.
Move checkers and try to listen.”
Speaking to Mrs. May, she added: “The Prime Minister is thinking about his position where his promise should be kept.”
Mr Farage said at the rally that if the 2016 referendum decision was betrayed, politicians should be forced to understand the “disturbing situation”.
“It has become a matter of faith among the people and politicians,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re going to tell them, ‘If we do that, we won’t let you escape.’”
To the enthusiastic public, he said: “I want politicians who are trying to betray Brexit to face a hostile situation.
We are driving the masses who have won our Brexit and will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud UK.
Anti-Brexit protesters staged a two-hour rally in the center of the city in Birmingham.
The company has also released a series of anti-Brexit banners against the Tories after a team of workers was formed at the end of this week.
Labour leader Adonis ridiculed the Conservatives at the conference after he faced security issues on a party app.
"Some people are telling us that they can keep their borders open, free trade along the Irish border, Canada's plus plus and IT systems in place," he added.
“It’s a complete waste.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren is considering a "hard eye" on becoming a presidential candidate.

The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Chowk Warren, who is often critical of President Trump, is contesting against GOP State candidate Geoff Deel in the November re-election, who was also vice president of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
Rumors are rife around him that he could compete with Trump in the 2020 election.
The meeting was the 36th with its organizers at Holiok Town Hall on Saturday evening after Trump took office.
One of the participants asked him about his candidacy for president.
"The time has come for us to overcome this broken government under the leadership of a woman," Warren said.

Batten Rouge, LA Police said on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for shooting LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
Deton Simpson, 20, was arrested at 11 a.m., the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, requesting to identify the person in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot dead on Friday morning on the campus of Southern University.
Police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media that "Wed Siems was shot in the head and killed," according to the 247Sports report.
The victim was killed by Simpson while trying to save his friend.
Cecch Simpson has been arrested and admitted to being on the scene, he has found weapons, and he has admitted to shooting Wed Sims.

Russian Grand Prix: Luis Hamilton moved closer to the world title by relying on the gifted victory of fellow-party Sebastian Vettel.
It became clear on Saturday that Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton and said that the order of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
Bots started well from the Caucus Pole, almost ignoring Hamilton, holding his position on the first two left and inviting Vettel to attack his own team player.
Vettel left Hamilton behind in the crowd, which could have been decisive.
The driver of Merseyside pitted the next lap and followed Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after the fight to pull the trigger to see that the Ferrari driver left the inside blank with the risk of accidentally losing the opportunity by doing a double-move.
Max Verstappen started from the back row on his 21st birthday and finished seventh after the first lap.
After that, he was in the first part of the race, then with the bad tire, he took the fourth place behind Kimi Raikkonen.
He batted No. 44 in the lap, but could not speed up the rest of the eight laps, leaving Ryecony at No. 4.
It was a tough day because Valerie fought well all weekend and acted like a real gentleman.
"The team is doing a great job of putting in the first place," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday, claiming that she had not leaked a letter written by Christine Blazee Ford on allegations of sexual assault against Nominee Brett Kavanaugh of the Supreme Court of the United States.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about the issue, but instead said that what is going on in the Senate is exposing people's "low and nasty and false" mindset.
"This is one thing that could have been and the beautiful thing that's been going on in the Senate for the past few weeks, you'll see anger, when you see the low and the ugly and the liars," he said.
When they see the information leaking, they will say, "Oh, I didn't do that."
Oh my gosh, I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Diana Feinstein, what did you find?
You'll remember the answer to your question, "Oh, what?"
Oh my God, no.
I didn't catch it."
Come on, wait a minute.
"We didn't, we didn't, we didn't," he said.
The letter was sent to Ford Feinstein in July with a description of the allegations against Kavanaugh, and the letter was leaked in September - but Feinstein denied that the letter was leaked from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's complaints, I didn't leak anything," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill's report.
"He told me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret according to his word."
But he did not say what the president said, he opened his mouth at a Saturday night rally: "I say what happened, it was a very bad body language."
Maybe he didn’t, but I’ve never seen a worse body language.”
Speaking on behalf of Supreme Court Namini, who is accused of sexual misconduct by three women, he said the Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
They want to get their power back at any cost.
"Look at the low mentality, look at the rudeness, don't allow them to hurt anyone, don't force anyone to step down to gain power and control," the president said.

Air traffic controllers have saved hundreds of lives on the plane from the earthquake in exchange for their lives.
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been awarded the hero's status after he died while helping to fly a plane with more than 100 passengers.
More than 800 people have died on the island of Sulawesi on Friday and many are missing.
The area is repeatedly shaking in the wake of a strong tremor, and people are trapped in the debris in the pool.
Despite fleeing for fear of life, the 21-year-old Antonios Gunavan Palur Mutiyara did not leave the control tower at Sis al-Jufri Airport.
From there, he confirmed that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could fly safely.
Then he jumped down in fear that the control tower would collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Johannes Sirite, a spokesman for the Indonesian Air Force, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News.
In Kalimantan, we arrange a helicopter from Balakpapan to take him to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken when we hear this news," he added.
In the meantime, authorities fear the death toll could rise to thousands, the disaster response agency said, adding that the connectivity to Dongala, Sigi and Butong cities has been limited.
"The death toll is expected to rise as many bodies are trapped under debris that have yet to be reached," said Sutopo Puryo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
The six-metre-high wave of destruction drives the lila where mass graves will be arranged on Sunday.
Relief and assistance is being provided with military and commercial aircraft.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: “The body is coming in the ambulance every minute. “The body is coming in the ambulance every minute.
Clean water is not available.
Small markets have been looted everywhere."
Jean Galfond, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is quickly taking help from the survivors, but we don't know what we'll see there.
It’s already sad, but the situation could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who arrived in Palu on Sunday, told the soldiers: "I request you to continue the rescue work day and night.
Are you ready?" the CNN report.
Earlier this year, Indonesia's Lombok earthquake killed more than 550 people.
An Air New Guinea plane crash: One missing in Legun plane crash, Air New Guinea says
One of the planes crashed into the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, where they previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued from the sinking plane.
Air New Guinea said in a report on Saturday afternoon that a male passenger could not be found.
The airline said it was working with local administrations, hospitals and investigators to find out.
The airline immediately declined to provide details of the passenger's age and nationality.
The aircraft helped rescue some of the local boat passengers and crew after it crashed into the water while trying to land at Chak Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were also in the hospital on Saturday, and all were in stable condition.
It is not yet clear what caused the accident.
Both the U.S. Navy and Air Force said the plane went down in the water before it reached the runway.
A number of witnesses believed the plane had crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jens said the plane had gone down.
"That's a good thing," Jens said.
Gens said he and the others crossed the waist and reached the emergency door of the sinking plane.
He said that the passengers were screaming in terror and had a slight injury to their head.
The U.S. Navy said that the sailors, who were engaged in the work of a Jetty Sarai nearby, also helped in the rescue. They brought people to shore by a wind-filled boat before the plane sank in 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
According to the Aceh Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but there have been no air New Guinea accidents.
The researchers found that the woman's body was burned several times during the fire.
The prosecution filed the case on Saturday in re-trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014 in Mississippi.
U.S. Judicial Analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He describes in front of the jury how the 29-year-old victim, Quinton Teles, used cell phone records, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, made the night news of her death.
Raulette said he recovered a number of cellphones that showed that the teles and chambers were together on the evening of his death, which was reported by Clareon Laser, against the previous teles.
According to the information, he was with his cell phone chambers at the time, although he pretended that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in the city that night.
When the prosecutors asked if Teles was telling the truth that he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford replied that "it was a lie, because his truck was in Nashville that day."
Another inconsistencies are that Teles said he knew her two weeks before Chambers' death.
Cell phone records show that they have only known each other for a week.
Raoult said that shortly after Chambers' death, Teles deleted text, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He's been kicked out of his life," Haley said.
The last hearing in the case is scheduled for Sunday.
The judge said the case is expected to go to the court the next day.

Is there another black one?!
New York's Nanny has filed a lawsuit against a couple on charges of being fired after the "discriminatory" text.
A New York nanny is suing the concerned couple for discriminatory extradition after receiving misleading text from a mother, calling him "another black."
The couple has denied being racially discriminated and has sought a lawsuit against "Julum."
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Falxman, expressed her disappointment after arriving on the first day of work in 2016 after learning that Gizel Morris, a black man, was the baby's new caregiver.
"Naaaaaaaaaaa another black," Ms. Plasco-Falxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, twice.
Later on, realizing his mistake, "disagreeable" Plasco-Palxman fired Ms. Morris. She said that her former nanny, who was an African-American, had hoped for a Filipino as a result of working poorly, reports the New York Post.
Ms. Morris was given one day's wages and then called Uber and sent home.
Maurice Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation in the extradition case and seeking compensation as $350 a day for six months, although he was initially hired as a housewife without a contract.
"I want to show them, see, it can't be done," he told the post on Friday, adding, "I know this is discrimination."
The couple objected to their claim that the expulsion of Maurice was a reasonable act of fear that he could not be trusted after he has been charged.
"She didn't want to tell me what my wife sent me.
He is not a racist.
We are not a racist couple," her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"Would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've abused, even if it was wrong?"
Is it your child's birthright?
Say it."
Regarding the allegation of "julum", Plasco said his wife had given birth to a baby just two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Do you want to go against someone like that?"
"It's not that bad," said the investment banker.
The couple's conduct and arguments were strongly condemned by the public court on social media in the wake of the ongoing legal case.
The Peach Paddington publication has expressed fears that readers may not be able to relate themselves to the talking bear, published in the new paper.
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Peach Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It is difficult to say before publication what the mind of the first reader will be."
It's interesting to know that this is after the huge success of Paige Paddington.
Her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before getting inspiration from the little toy bear to write children's books, said he would be hopeful of rejecting his work. He also said that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication after his death last year was "unusual" for him.
Regarding Pablo Paddington, whom he described as "a very important member of our family," he said his father was very proud of his ultimate success.
"He was a quiet man, and not an arrogant man," he said.
"But Paddington was so real to him that it was as if your own child had achieved some success: you are proud of him, even though you have no clue.
I think that's the way he sees Paddington's success.
Although it was the fruit of his own creation and imagination, he always credited himself to Paddington.
My daughter was on the way to death and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, his daughter was rushed to the Nice Hospital, Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nad used to call regularly and say it's too bad, and he probably won't survive," Ms. Eden-Laperoz said.
"Then I got Nad's phone and found out he was going to die in two minutes and I was forced to say goodbye to him on the phone."
I do and I do.
I said, "Oh my gosh, I love you.
I'll get back to you soon.
I'll come to you soon.
The medicines that doctors gave to keep his heart on, were slowly stopping working in his body and coming out of his body.
He died a short time ago, and then everything stopped.
I had no choice but to wait.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was close to family and people.
I had to hold myself."
At last, Ms. Adnan-Laperoz, then mourning the death of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers - she was unresponsive to this difficult situation.
Nobody knows," he said.
“I fell head down, my eyes were watering.
It's impossible to describe it in detail, but I was sitting on a plane and dealing with the inescapable pain of the NAD.
He needs my love and compassion.
I know how much he loved her.
The woman posted a suicide note on the bridge.
Two women, who have lost their loved ones to suicide, work to stop the suicide of others.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries posted cards and phone numbers with inspirational messages at Welsh Bridge, where people can call for help.
Tyler, the son of Miss Davis, has been suffering from depression since the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I'm doing," he said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Leeds, said her son was a promising chef and had an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone would have said that his smile brightened the house."
However, before he died, he quit his job, because he had "really gone into the dark."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old, was found dead.
"I'm constantly worried that this effort will be interrupted," said Mister Davis.
Mr. Davis wrote, "To let everyone know that there is a man you can talk to, he can be a friend."
Don't be silent, you need to talk.
Miz Humphreys, who has been Miss Davis's girlfriend for many years, has lost her 15-year-old partner Mark, only after her mother's death.
"She never said she was depressed or depressed," he said.
Let's take a look at some of the changes he made two days before Christmas.
"He was in a very bad condition on Christmas Day - he didn't even shake his eyes with them when the kids opened their presents."
He said his death was a huge emotional blow to him, but he had to overcome it: "It created a huge vacuum in the family."
The sun has set us apart.
But we have to fight on our way."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in question as the FBI investigation begins.
"I thought, if we could give him anything he wanted - since the time of the investigation is limited, the opportunity is limited - we could probably bring some unity," said Mr. Fleck on Saturday. He also said that he was concerned that the committee might "fall into disarray" in the wake of this biased stalemate.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
They are bound by their obligations over time.
The midterm elections will be held on November 6, just five weeks away - if, as expected, Republicans make a bad result, their efforts to get the likes to the country's highest court will be too weak.
George W. Bush is calling senators and lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House under Mr. Bush. Through him, Mr. Bush met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report is submitted?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Vice President Mike Pence to tie him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors "comes" under Kim.
The number of North Korean defectors has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byung-seg, quoting data from South Korea's Ministry of Consolidation, said the number of dissidents last year was 1,127 - up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said strict border controls between North Korea and China and the money laundering of human traffickers was the main reason.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments on the matter.
A large number of defectors from North Korea have been granted South Korean citizenship.
More than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most of them fled to China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and is much easier than crossing the highly protected disarmament zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers these refugees not as refugees, but as illegal immigrants and often force them back to their country.
The relationship between North and South Korea, which is still at war, has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the stalled nuclear disarmament talks.
It comes after a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they fairly agreed to work towards building a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Mr. Ri said, “If the United States has no confidence in our national security, we will have no confidence in our national security, and in such a situation we will not disarm ourselves unilaterally in the first place.”
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysteria-stricken". She said she was ineligible to serve in the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader of the House of Representatives, has called the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysteria-infected" and said he was inherently inappropriate in serving his duties in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas on Saturday.
Peel Peeloi told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday about Kavanaugh's reaction to his testimony, saying: "I never thought that if a woman had ever done such a thing, she would have been called "hysteria-infected."
Kakashi Kavanaugh has denied the allegations, saying he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blazi when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was emotional at the time of his initial statement, screaming about his family and high school life, and holding his breath.
He categorically condemned the Democrats on the committee and described the allegations against him as a "foolish and complicating character" organized by the Liberals, alleging that it was being done because of Hillary Clinton's anger at the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he is not worthy of the Supreme Court because it proves that he is biased against Democrats.
"I think he has proved himself incompetent in the statement he made and the way he has resisted Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
When he was asked if Kavanaugh was sure and whether he would be impeached if the Democrats won a majority in the House, Pelosi denied it.
"I would say that -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI -- he's not only not worthy of the Supreme Court, but also unqualified of the court he's in now," Pelosi said.
Kakashi Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Circuit Court of Appeals in DC.
Peel Pelosi added that as a Democrat he was concerned that Kavanaugh would oppose the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade because he himself is a Conservative Justice.
In his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would change some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"It can't be allowed to happen that a hysteria-injured, biased person will go to the court and tell us 'Isn't it great,'" Pelosi said.
Women and men need to control it.
It's a fair debate, months and years of anger have been coming out, and she can't stop crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Ms. Steinme told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's rare, what do you say?"
"A woman executive has helped me a lot, who used to say that she would cry even if she was angry. But she chose this approach that when she started crying in anger, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You may think I'm sad, because I'm crying."
I'm really angry."
Then he continued on.
I thought it was awesome."
Tears of tears partially serve as a manifestation of anger, because they are essentially misunderstandings.
One of my earliest memories of a job, a male-dominated office, where I once saw myself crying in unimaginable rage, an old woman holding my scarf - who was a terrible manager I was always a little afraid of - who dragged me down the stairs.
"Don't let them see that you're crying," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to see you."
Patrick Schroeder, the then Colorado Democratic Congresswoman, worked with him during Gary Hart's presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on a boat called Manky Business abroad about extramarital affairs and left the race for dirty work, Ms. Schroder felt deeply disappointed that there was no reason not to be a candidate for his own presidency.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," he said, smiling after 30 years.
"There are already seven other candidates in the fray, and no one wants another candidate.
One of them called it "snow white and seven dwarfs."
As the campaign was delayed at the beginning of the campaign, he was lagging behind in fundraising, and so he vowed not to run the race without raising $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
He saw that if a supporter was given $1,000 to a man, he would be given only $250.
"Do they think I'm going to get paid?" he said in surprise.
When he announced that he would not run a formal campaign, he was overwhelmed with emotion and gratitude to his supporters, frustrated with the system that made it difficult to raise money, he fired delegates and targeted voters, and became angry about gender inequality.
"You could have thought I had neurological problems," said Ms Schroeder, recalling the media's behavior.
"You could have thought that Clenix was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking, where are they going to bury me?
"Did he cry?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could go in favour of Beijing
The first phase of the U.S.-China trade war was collapsing, and when the war ends, Beijing could benefit from the long-term conflict between the two countries, like experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump warned earlier this year that major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum, would be taxed.
This week, when almost half of the total imports from China, amounting to about $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), new tariffs were imposed.
Beijing has retaliated as usual - most recently they have increased tariffs by five to ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has decided to fight with the eyes of China, and the world's second-largest economy is unlikely to lose sight of it anytime soon.
Washington's reluctance to back down Washington means that it will be extremely humiliating for Chinese President <0x58>i Jinping to publicly bow his head to the United States.
Despite this, experts say that if Beijing can play Tas properly, U.S. trade war pressures can help China positively in the long run by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
"Any quick political decision by Washington or Beijing could lead to an economic collapse in both countries is far more dangerous than the idea of a well-informed world," said Abigail Grace, associate researcher at the think tank, Center for New American Security, who studies Asia.
Syria is “prepared” to take back its refugees, the foreign minister said.
Syria says the country is ready to voluntarily return the refugees, and urges them to rebuild the seven-year-old war-ravaged country.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Molaym said the situation in the country is improving.
"The situation is stable and secure today because of the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate to bring back normalcy to the areas destroyed by terrorists.
All conditions are now favorable for people who are forced to leave the country voluntarily due to terrorism and the loss of daily life and livelihood due to the global economic situation.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
The remaining 6 million people in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Molaym said the Syrian government welcomed all assistance in rebuilding the country.
He, however, insisted that no conditional assistance would be taken or the support of the rebel-supporting country would be taken.
Winner of the Paris Rider Cup
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup in France, beating Team USA with a final score of 16.5-10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris.
The U.S. has been defeated six times on European soil and has not won a rider's cup since 1993.
Team Europe, led by Danish captain Thomas Bynes, reached the 14.5 points required to defeat the United States and regained the title.
American star Phil Mickelson, who hasn't played well in most of the tournaments, hit his T-shot in the 16th hole at Par-3, and lost his match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinary has been one of only 4 in 1 to score above 5-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979, showing brilliant performances across all rounds.
American Jordan Spieth, the lowest-ranked player in the European team, has been crowned 5th and 4th by Denmark's Thorbjorn Olsen.
Dustin Johnson, the world's top-ranked player, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who probably played his last Ryder Cup.
Experienced in the eight-time rider's cup, Spain's Sergio Garcia has become Europe's all-time winner with 25.5 career points.
"I usually cry, but this time I can't."
It's been a bad year.
Thank you to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy I got my cup back.
It's a success of the team, I'm happy that I've been able to help," Garcia said, emphasizing on European win.
He was handed over to his country's John Ram, who lost to American legend golfer Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in the singles on Sunday.
"I'm so proud of losing Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him," said 23-year-old John Ram.
Woodes lost four of his matches in France, setting his record in the Ryder Cup 13-21-3.
It's incomprehensible statistics for one of the best players of all time, who only won 14 major titles after Jack Nicklaus, who was on top.
Team USA, with the exception of Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finnau, has been rocking the entire weekend.
Captain Jim Furick said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of them, they fought.
This morning we put a little bit of pressure on Europe.
We haven't really been able to.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He is a good leader.
All of his 12 players played very well.
"We will turn around, I will work with the PGA and the Rider Cup Committee of America and move forward."
I love these 12 people and am proud to be their leader.
You have to respect them.
We didn't get to play."
Red Current Updates: Density decreases in Pineapple, Manatee and Sarasota
A new report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission showed a general decrease in the red current concentration in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, the Bloom situation of the patch has been observed in the counties of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier - a sign of a decrease in density.
The bloom of the red stream extends along the coast for about 130 miles from North Pinellas to South Lee County.
Patches can be seen about 10 miles away from the shores of Mount Hillsborough County, but have been less noticeable than last week.
Red tides have also been observed in Pasco County.
Over the past week, the average density on the shores and away from the shores of Pinellas County, far from the shores of Hillsborough County, far from the shores of Manatee County, the excess density on and off the coast of Sarasota County, the moderate density on the coasts of Charlotte County, the low density on the coasts and away from the shores of Lee County, and the Colorado County reported low density.
Shortness of breath is still being reported from the counties of C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire, Manatee, and Sarasota, Lee, and Collier.
There have been no reports of respiratory problems from northwest Florida for the past week.
