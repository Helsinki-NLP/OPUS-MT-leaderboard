I'm not worried about "smoking"
Some AMs are skeptical about the suggestion of changing their title to MWP (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
This is due to the change of the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
I am worried that the political parties are not going to change this.
A Labour AM said its group was concerned about the title "like Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Wales: twp in Welsh means stupid and pwp means stool.
A plaid AM said that the entire group was "naked" and suggested options.
A Welsh Conservative said that his group is "clear minded" about the change in name, but stated that the MWP to Muppet was a minor verbal harassment.
In this context, the Welsh surname is pronounced as Yorkshire English u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce a change in the name, said: "The final decision on any description of what to name an assembly member will of course depend on the members."
The Welsh Assembly has been given the right to change its name by the Wales Government Act 2017.
In June, the Commission published findings of public consultation on these proposals that showed widespread support for the Assembly to name a Welsh Parliament.
In the case of AM's title, the Commission did not favour a Welsh Parliament member or WMP, but, the MWP option received the most support in public consultation matters.
AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to reach a consensus could be a headache for Presiding Officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft law on the changes within a few weeks.
This Act on Amendments shall include other changes in the working practices of the Assembly, including the rules on disqualification of AMs and the structure of the Committee arrangement.
When we talk about the law, we will take a final view on the question of what name they should be referred to.
Macedonians vote to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The referendum is aimed at resolving decades of conflict with neighboring Greece, a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of this neighbor to its north is equivalent to representing their territory and that the EU and NATO members have consistently objected to its attempt to give it.
President George Ivanov of Macedonia is a staunch opponent of the name change.
But, along with Prime Minister Zoran Zhaev, supporters of the referendum claim that the change in name is the only cost of joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells calmed down during clashes at Churches in Harlem
"From a historical point of view, according to the older people I spoke to, there was once and a discussion on every corner," Mr Adams said.
"There's nothing today."
He said it was clear that the bar had disappeared.
“People come together in different ways,” he said.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people go on a regular basis."
In the case of churches, they worry that the money from the sale of the property will not last as long as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will return to the starting place."
He further said that apartment buildings could come in place of churches, in which there would be condominiums filled by people who did not help the neighbouring shelters.
"The majority of the people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white," he said, "and so the time for these churches to be completely closed will come soon because most of the people who live in these condominiums are unlikely to be members of these churches."
After a decade of St. Martin's, in 1870, the metropolitan community - before Harlem became the black metropolis - both churches were built by groups of white people.
A group of original white Methodists came out in the 1930s.
The building was owned by a group of black people who were almost praying.
A group of blacks led by Rev. John Howard took over St. Martin, who led the retailers' boycott on 125th Street, was the main road to shopping in Harlem, and they opposed hiring or promotion of blacks.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild it, starting the Carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly named the carillon "the bells of the poor."
In July, an expert who played the carillon referred to it in another way: "a cultural treasure" and "a unique historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that the blacksmith, Dionysio A. Lind, was the first carillon in the world to debut in a much larger carillon in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Maryweeder stated that St. Martin did not transfer them.
What happened in St. Martins over the past few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, brought to some extent by church leaders, and the rest brought by Episcopal Diocese.
The Board of Directors of The Vestry – Paris was made up of general leaders – they expressed concern in writing the Diocese in July that the Diocese would attempt to hand over the "cost matter" to the Vestry, though Vestri was not involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the Diocese.
Some parishioners complained that there was a lack of transparency in favour of dialysis.
In California, a 13-year-old boy was injured on a lobster drive.
Officials said a 13-year-old boy was attacked by a shark on Saturday for a lobster on the first day of the lobster season.
The attack took place at 7 am near the Bikinis coast in Ensinitas.
Chad Hamal told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he heard a boy screaming for help when he was swimming with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning, and he went to him with a group and helped him get out of the water.
Hamlin said that at first she felt a sense of humour when she caught the lobster, but then she found out that he was screaming, taking my chaw!
I've got my cheese!"
"It was all over the place," said Hamlin, after he had saved the baby.
"I told everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" said Hamlin.
The boy was taken to the Redi Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is said to be critical.
The shark species responsible for the attack could not be identified.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles told a news conference that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species.
The victim suffered serious injuries on the upper part of the body.
Authorities blocked access to the beach for 48 hours from Panto Beach in Casablanca to Swamys in Acintas for safety and security reasons.
Gailson noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
The company plans to enter the UK cosmetics market.
The Sensbury Department is competing with boots, superdrug and Debenhams through the appointment of store-style beauty oils expert assistants.
As the market continues to grow as fashion and homeware sales continue to decline, as part of the UK's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn cosmetics market, more large beauty oils will be tested in 11 stores across the country and taken to more stores next year if it succeeds.
When looking for ways to use shelf space once used by TVs, microwaves, and homewares, there is an investment in cosmetics.
Sensbury said the number of cosmetics will be doubled to 3,000, including brands such as Revlon, Assy, Twizarman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current ranges of L'Or<0xC3><0xA9>al, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also get more space in branded parts found in stores such as Boots.
This supermarket is also resuming its beauty makeup range so that most products will be suitable for vegetarians – there is a growing demand from young buyers.
In addition, Perfume Retailer Fragrance Shop will be offering discounts in two Sensible Stores, the first of which opened last week, in Croydon in South London, and the second later this year, in Sally Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the trend of buying a small amount of food every day in local convenience stores means supermarkets have to do a lot to attract people to you.
Sensbury's Chief Executive, Mike Kup, said these sales centres will look more like department stores and at the same time supermarkets are trying to deal with more services and non-foods against chain Aldi and Liddell distributors.
Sensbury is setting up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and they have also launched several Habitats since they bought these two chains two years ago, which, in their opinion, have been successful in increasing grocery sales, have made these acquisitions more profitable.
The market's previous attempts to reshape its beauty and pharmacy departments have failed.
Sensbury tested a joint venture with Boots in 2000, but the partnership was formed after a dispute over how to split income from chemist stores in its supermarkets.
This new policy comes after Sensbury sold its 281-store pharmacy business, Celcio, to the owners of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125m three years ago.
He said Lloyds will play a role in the scheme by including a wide range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Pose and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sensbury, says: “We have changed the nature of our beauty oils to enhance the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be ready to give advice.
Our range of brands has been tailored to every need and we are an attractive beauty destination challenging the old shopping method due to the attractive environment and convenient locations."
Peter Jones 'failed' after Holly Willoughby pulled out of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
TV presenter Holly Willoughby has cancelled a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willowby doesn’t have time for your homeware and accessories brand True.
This business is compared to Paltrow's Guppy brand in Gwyneth.
This morning, the 37-year-old said on Instagram that he was leaving.
Holly Willowby has stepped out of her lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute to instigate Dragons Den Star Peter Jones – and has focused on its new grand contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones "frustrated" when this popular girl on TV admitted in a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals - worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant she no longer had time to pay attention to her homeware and accessories brand True.
The business is compared to Paltrow's Gup brand in Guyana, and it is estimated that Bilobi's wealth will double to <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
Willoughby, 37, declared that he was really coming out of Instagra, Jones exited the UK by a jet and went to one of his holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly was at the top of Holly's priority list so far.
It would have been her long-term future which would have made her successful over the next two or three decades.
Everyone was surprised by her decision to leave.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday.
Marlow headquarters has a warehouse full of items that are ready to be sold."
According to experts, the firm's huge investment in a range of products, from cushions to candles, and clothing to homeware, will cause millions of losses, with the departure of one of Britain's most trusted stars, and its launch is likely to be delayed further.
This could be the end of a long-term friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been very close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for the last ten years.
Willoughby founded True in 2016 along with Cap and Jones, and 52-year-old Jones joined in March as president.
The couple spends holidays together and Jones owns 40 per cent of Baldwin's TV production firm.
Willoughby is set to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace ITV's I Am A Celebrity host, Ant McPartlin.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We're not going to comment on these business developments."
"We're in love and we're in love"
Some said he was trying to make news media about the president's "innocent" opinion and being so positive about the president of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his "news anchor" style.
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim is looking forward to a second meeting after Trump praised the initial meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards disarmament of North Korea.
But the disarmament negotiations have come to a halt.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong told the UN world leaders at a general meeting on Saturday that the United States does not seem to be getting a “decisive response” to North Korea’s early disarmament moves.
Instead, he said the U.S. is trying to keep up with the pressure.
President Trump expressed a more optimistic view in his speech.
"We have good relations with North Korea," he said.
"We're going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people were killed.
Now we've got our big break."
Our efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results – rocket tests have stopped, Olsen’s rescue is helping, and the rest of the US staff are returning home.
And he supported his unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people into this crowded space, it's better to have about 200 people here," Trump said, pointing a little finger at the crowd in front of him.
Indonesia tsunami and earthquake destroyed one island, killing hundreds of people
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lombok’s population has been relocated elsewhere, no national disaster has been declared, which is a prerequisite for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, he made it very clear that he is not requesting international assistance, so this is a bit challenging," Ms Sumbang said.
While Save the Children is preparing a team to go to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreign workers can work in the actual location.
A spokesman for the National Disaster Response Agency, Sutopo, said Indonesian authorities are studying the situation in Palu to see if foreign entities can be allowed to contribute to the relief efforts.
In Indonesia, the country is less prepared to deal with the natural calamities.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aseh, they are not easily found on other coastlines.
Although a warning has been issued earlier, there is a possibility of life being lost in Palu due to the absence of a tsunami warning siren.
It is difficult to travel to many islands in Indonesia during the best times.
Natural disasters make it more difficult to cope with disasters.
A hospital ship, set up to treat earthquake victims in Lombok, is heading towards Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new crisis site.
President Joko Widodo was at the center of an election campaign that brought the issue of improving Indonesia's bustling infrastructure, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But there is a problem with the administration of Mr. Jokowi, who is facing the challenge of re-election next year.
Mr. Joko also faces pressure from the long-standing ethnic tensions in Indonesia, in which the Muslim majority has chosen a more narrow faith path.
Christian and Muslim groups using axes, arrows, and bows, and other village weapons, fighting on the streets killed more than 1,000 people and displaced thousands of people from their homes.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Streisand to face Chelsea
Daniel Streijs scored a goal in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday to save Liverpool from a Premier League defeat from Chelsea.
While Stirling's team was trailing 1-0, he got a pass from Sherdan Shakiri, out of Chelsea's goal of about 30 yards.
He tapped the ball on his left side and then picked up a shot to the far post.
His attempt went to the top of the box and fell to the top of the net.
Finally, the ball went from Kappa Arizabalaga, who took the ball, and fell into the net.
"He was just trying to get into that position, getting on the ball and always playing as forward as possible, so I tried to take as much time for myself as possible," he told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kent coming and touched once and didn't think much about it and just shot a shot."
Chelsea were 1-0 up in the middle after getting a point in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
At that time the Blues striker again sent a pass to Matteo Kovacic, then bounced near midfield and ran into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic quickly gave up on the midfield.
He then threw a beautiful blow, so he went into the Hazard box.
Hazard crossed the defensive line and saw Alison Baker of Liverpool end his game by throwing a shot in a distant post on the left leg.
Liverpool will take on Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy at 3 pm on Wednesday.
Chelsea will take on Vidioton in the UEFA Europa League in London on Thursday at 3 pm.
The death toll in Indonesia's Tsunami has risen to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said on Sunday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake on Friday left many people trapped in the rubble of buildings and triggered a 20-feet-high quake, said Sutopo Purbo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
More than 380,000 people live in the city of Palu, and the buildings that fall there have now become rubble.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murdering a woman
An investigation has been launched into the murder of a woman in Burkina Faso this morning.
A 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a 44-year-old woman, who was found dead at 7.55 am at Grayson Meows on John Street, along with her injuries.
The police have urged people in the area to come forward if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I urge anyone in the area of John Street in Burkina Faso to contact us if they have seen or heard anything suspicious."
I would appeal to anyone, especially the taxi drivers, who have made any punctuation on the dashcam foot, to contact us as they may have essential information for our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman was a resident of Burkina Faso and her body was found inside a building.
A friend of mine came to the scene this morning and asked her where she was.
The investigation is ongoing and we are informing the next of kin of the deceased.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Meows was seen entering his flat, but police told him that no one was allowed to enter or exit the building.
He was silent when he realized what had happened.
Residents were told that they would be allowed back into the building after several hours.
A police officer said the entire area has been designated as a place of crime.
A woman came to the scene and was crying.
She said, "It's very bad."
At 2 p.m., two police vans were inside the siege and another van was on the outside.
Several officers were standing inside the siege and guarding the blocks of the flats.
If anyone has any information, they should give it to DM <0x40>MerPolCC or call 101 or contact Crimestoppers by mentioning the 30th of September log 247 on Ninavi 0800 555 111.
Cromwells statue in Parliament is the latest monument hit by controversy over rewriting history
If he is removed, it would be like giving a poetic justice because the purist followers of his fiery head have carried out the Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts.
But the Chromwell Society has called Mr. Crick's suggestion "stupid" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Chromwell Society, said: "It was a coincidence that the ongoing controversy over the removal of statues would have damaged the image of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster.
Cromwell didn't ask for the glory of the English Civil War to be done or even brought about.
Perhaps the wrong chromowell may have been sacrificed for the actions of their ancestors Thomas of the previous century.
The grand description of Cromwell by Sir William Hammo Thornecroft is evidence of the 19th century opinion and is part of the historical narrative of this personality that many still believe to be revered.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "According to many, perhaps more so in the latter part of the 19th century than today, Chromwell was, in his case, a supporter of the Parliament over external pressures, of course of the monarchy.
Whether the description is absolutely correct has been the subject of historical debate.
One thing is for sure that the struggle in the mid-17th century has shaped the later development of our country, and Chromewell is a personal identifiable person who represents one side of that range.
His performance as Lord Protector is also festive and memorable."
China's sugar mills have been hit by the
Local media reported that a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in China's southwestern part of the country.
The South China Morning Post reported on Sunday that the man's nickname was "Yuan," and his blood vessel was found dead in a pool of blood at the Lippanshui market in the province of Guishu.
On May 30, 2005, a farmer was preparing to vaccinate pigs in a hogry in <0x58>injiang, China's Qinghai province.
It was reported that he along with his cousin had come to the market from the nearby Yunnan province.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he found that the door of the nearby pig cage was open.
He said that there was a big blood clot in his throat.
A forensic investigation has confirmed that the 550-pound duke was killed by the farmer, the report said.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and confused," said another brother, whose fight was called "Wu," according to Guiyang Ivining News.
According to security camera footage, the Yuan entered the market at 4.40 am on Thursday to feed its pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig who killed him was not the owner of Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Ivining News that he was locked up to prevent anyone from being attacked by the pig, police were collecting evidence from the site.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Even though this is a rare occurrence, pigs have reported incidents of assault on humans in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in Massachusetts and seriously injured the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig was crushed by a Welsh farmer on his tractor, and his wife finally threw it away.
After a farmer in Oregon ate his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that ducks are not usually aggressive but that blood sugar can make them "good."
"They're just playing games.
They’re very, very intelligent, they don’t want to hurt you.
You just have to respect them," he said.
Rainfall is likely to continue in the southwestern United States due to the impact of the Rosa storm
It is estimated that as the rosa storm is moving over more cold waters off the northern coast of Mexico, its intensity is decreasing.
However, it is expected to receive heavy rains in the coming days in northern Mexico and the US.
At 5 a.m. as of Sunday Eastern Time, the speed of the rosa wind was 85 mph, meaning it is a Category 1 storm and it is 385 kilometers southwest of Punta Yuvania.
It is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Pacific Ocean is beginning to take shape and it is moving eastwards to the West Coast of the United States. As a tropical storm on Monday moves toward the Rosa Baja California Peninsula, it will begin to push temperate humidity deep northwards to the southwestern United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico.
Later, moderate to moderate humidity along with incoming balloons will create widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest region in the coming days.
Rainfall of 1 to 4 inches at the local level is likely to lead to dangerous floods, debris will flow and possibly a landslide in the desert.
Due to the temperate humidity in the deep, the rainfall will be 2 to 3 inches per hour in some places, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to rain 2 to 4 inches in most parts of the country, especially in the southwest.
Due to the icy nature of the temperate rainfall, it is possible to suddenly flood with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
It is very dangerous to go out in the desert when there is a danger of tropical rain.
The canyons can become rivers filled with heavy rains and strong winds and dust storms will occur at the local level.
Heavy rains are expected in parts of southern California.
More than half an inch of rain is possible, allowing a light amount of debris to flow and the roads will be slippery.
This will be the first rainy season in the region.
There will be some light rain in Arizona late on Sunday and Monday morning, followed by Monday late and Tuesday.
Heavy rain is expected to continue through Tuesday and into Wednesday.
The Arctic is getting colder in October, but temperatures are likely to drop sharply in October.
This often results in a dramatic change in temperature over a short period of time.
Sunday is a great example of a dramatic change in temperature in Central America.
There is a temperature difference of about 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the heat of summer will rise and expand again.
A warm start is expected in early October, with widespread 80 degrees to the northeast from the southern plateaus in much of the central and eastern part of the United States.
The temperature in New York City is expected to hover around 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above the normal average.
According to our long-term weather forecast, temperatures are likely to be higher than average for East America in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have heard of Brett Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million people watched the emotional testimony Thursday given by Supreme Court-appointed Brad Cavenau and the woman, Christine Blassey Ford, who was accused of sexual assault in the 1980s.
In the meantime, while the political scandal persisted, broadcasters broke the regular schedule bypassing the last minute on Friday: an agreement reached by Arizon Sen: FBI's Jeff Flakes will operate for a week on the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Kevin had caught you drunk at a high school party and tried to take off his clothes.
Kevin, in a very emotional testimony, told us that we are 100% sure that nothing like this has happened.
More than 20.4 million people are expected to see the testimony on Friday, Nelson said.
The average number of viewers is calculated by the company on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data from other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which showed the event was not immediately available.
And Nelson usually has some problems in calculating the number of people who see in offices.
In this view, the number is the same as the audience for a playoff football match or an academy award.
Presenters who strongly support Kevin's appointment, Fox News Channel, took the lead on all networks, with an average of 5.69 million viewers, during the entire day's hearing, Nelson said.
ABC finished second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS's 3.1 million, NBC's 2.94 million, MSNBC's 2.89 million, and CNN's 2.52 million.
After the hearing, curiosity reached the stage.
Friday's game was the highlight of the show.
After the midfield Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote for Kevin, he was detained by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as protesters chanted slogans against him while he was on his way to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood there for a few minutes and was seen on CNN.
"I'm in front of you," she said.
Do you think they are telling the truth?
They said, "You have the power when all women are powerless."
Fleck said his office had issued a statement and said before the elevator closed, that we have more to say in the committee's hearing.
When the Judiciary Committee was about to vote to send Kevin's nomination for the vote before the entire Senate, cable and broadcast networks did all the launches several hours later.
But Fleck said he would only do so on the basis of the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the appointment next week, which the minority Democrats are urging.
Fleck was partly convinced by his conversations with his minx, Democratic Senator Chris Cunnings.
After a discussion with Conn's and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's election had power, as it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kevinlaus without an investigation.
The FBI has launched an investigation into the allegations made by President Trump against Kevin.
British Prime Minister May has accused the critics of "politicizing" Brexit.
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, accused critics of "politicizing" Britain's future on her plans to leave the European Union and undermining national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will be in Birmingham, UK on September 20, 2018.
In one of his interviews on the newspaper's homepage, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson overtly attacked his alleged checkers' plan for Brexit, suggesting that Britain and the EU should collect each other's taxes is "absolutely unbelievable."
Police arrest dietitian Samson, suspect in LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the death of 20-year-old basketball player, Wade Sims, in LSU.
The 20-year-old dietitian was arrested and jailed for second-degree murder, the Batton Rouge police department said.
A video of the clash between Sims and Simson was released by the police, which said that Sims glasses were missing.
The police recovered the glasses from the spot and said that it contained the DNA of Simson, a CBS associate WAFB said.
Police said Simmons confessed to shooting and killing himself.
Prosecutors said the amount of his bond was fixed at $350,000.
The office of the East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner issued a preliminary report on Friday, saying the gunshot wound to the head had caused the death.
The department has credited the Louisiana State Police Futuristic Task Force, The State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and citizens of the area for assisting in the investigation.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Aleva thanked the regional legislative bodies for "following openness and justice."
The age of Sims was 20 years.
This forward player, who is 6 feet 6 inches tall, grew up in Betten Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He earned an average of 5.6 and took 2.6 rebounds in the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Wade's death had left the team "worrying" and "he's shocked."
"It's always something to worry about," Wade said.
Flooding in Mexico City
The ash from the Poketpetal volcano has reached near the southern part of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after it began to move rapidly, leaving 183 lots of gas and ash in 24 hours.
Many businesses and businesses were monitored by the department.
Pictures on social media showed car windows in nearby cities such as Shochimilco, Mexico City.
Geophysical experts have found an increase in activity in the area of the volcano, which is 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, Central Mexico, after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck in September 2017.
The volcano, Don Goo, has been active since 1994.
An encounter broke out between the police and the Catalan separatists ahead of the Independence Day celebrations.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and thousands of people joined rival demonstrations on the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarization vote over segregation.
When Dangal police intercepted a group of masked divisive supporters, they threw eggs and coloured husks, causing dust clouds to accumulate on the streets that were ravaged by the ARV tourists.
Later in the day, the police used batons to control the fire.
For several hours, the pro-independence groups were chanting "no, no, no" slogans, while the unificationist supporters were chanting, "Let Spain live."
Local media reported that 14 people were injured in the incident.
After the October 1 referendum, which saw Madrid as illegal but divided by the Catalans, there was a year-long tension in the region of independent thought.
A large number of voters chose to be independent, but the number of voters remained low as those who opposed the partition boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region during violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups had gathered late on Friday night to avoid a protest in support of the national police.
The protest would continue but he was forced to take a different path.
Narcissism Termis, 68, was involved in a divisive protest with his wife and said she no longer had any hope of gaining independence from Catalonia.
Last year we had a very good life.
I saw tears of joy in my parents' eyes while voting, but we were stuck," he said.
Despite winning a small but significant victory in regional elections last December, pro-Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain their momentum this year, and many of their popular leaders either have either accepted anonymity or have been detained in anticipation of a trial for their role in holding a referendum and then declaring independence.
Joan Pig, a 42-year-old mechanic, spoke on the phone to support the police, saying the fight was supported by politicians from both sides.
“The fight is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriel Jankeras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would contest next year's European parliamentary elections.
"The best way to stand out as a candidate for the European elections is to protest the fall in democratic values and our smiles from the Spanish government," he said.
London: Man arrested after car rams into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested for repeatedly entering a car in a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place around 10.30pm on Thursday.
Inspector Bob Blemings said the damage to the entrances and buildings was also caused.
A crossbow is also likely to be thrown on that car at some point.
Menga's attack gave Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston
As manager of the iBrox club, Steven Gerrard was surprised by the Rangers' second defeat in 18 games.
Dolly Meng's attack led to the cross and Gary Holt's team reached the second round with Hibernian.
Gerard's team went on to win the Premiership this season and next Sunday, they will face the hearts behind by eight points.
The Rangers will play against Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston will continue their unbeaten run in six matches in the division, with his coach Holt not seen a defeat since he took over from Kenny Myler last month.
Livingston takes a chance against the Botswana
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before scoring, as their perfect line-up put the Rangers in total danger.
Scott Robinson struck a circumnavigation, but he crawled in front of the goal, then Alan Lithgow was able to widen his effort only after Craig Holkett's header moved into the goal.
The hosts knew that they could trouble the visitors, so they agreed to let the Rangers play in front of them.
And that's how it turned out to be a big hit.
Rangers gave a free-kick and Livingston got a free kick. Declan Garagh and Robinson paired with Menga, took possession of the ball and scored from the middle of the box.
Until then, the Rangers had maintained their dominance, but the defenders of the opposing team were impervious to them, and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not suffer much.
The same pattern would remain in the second half, however Alfredo Morelos had to defend one from Kelly.
Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor's legs constricted Scott Pittman, and Lithgow sent the ball further away from Livingston.
Crosses in Livingston's box continued to come and they were consistently eliminated, while two penalty claims – the challenge Halkett made to substitute player Glenn Middleton, and one for handball – were abandoned.

It's a great game for Winston Churchill.
They played well, they played well, they performed better than expected in the direction of progress.
His style of play and players have rarely changed since his return from the top spot, but after Holt's arrival, he should be given a big credit for the way he shaped the team.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett played from the heart, led the excellent defensive line-up, while Mengan continued to flaunt Conor Goldson and Joe Voral.
However, the motivation of the Rangers was diminished.
As much as he was led by Gerard, he fell short of his standard game.
His last game was a lackluster – only once he hit the local team – a kind of warning for the midfielders.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an received a warm welcome in Cologne.
On Saturday, the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for a ceremony.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial German visit – a visit aimed at improving relations between the NATO allies.
He also spoke on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and the inclusion of Turkey in the EU.
He then went to Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an Colon to inaugurate a grand new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police said there were safety reasons for not crowding 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but many of the supporters had gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of people who protested against Erdogan – many of them Kurdish – also heard his voice, condemning Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome his country.
The divisive image of these guests, who were considered heroes by some German Turks and who were ridiculed by others as dictators, was reflected in these dual demonstrations.
Deptford road accident: Biker dies in collision with car
In London, a cyclist was killed when a car collided with a truck.
The accident occurred at about 10:15 BST, a busy road in Deptford, near the confluence of Bestwood Street and Evillen Street, in the southeastern part of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics helped, but the cyclist died on the spot.
This is the second such accident in the city, a few months after a cyclist was killed in a collision on Children's Street, about a mile away from the accident on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said they are working to identify the deceased and inform his relatives.
Roads have been closed and bus routes have been changed and motorists have been advised to avoid that part.
Six officers injured in rioting in Long Latin jail
Six prison officials were injured in a riot in a men's very safe prison, the prison office said.
The riots broke out in HMP Long Martin at 9:30 BST on Sunday and it continues.
In order to deal with the riot, the Toronto authorities have been called, with eight prisoners participating in the riot, and it is limited to one wing.
The officers suffered minor injuries on their faces and were treated.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to deal with the incident in HMP Long Lorraine.
Six persons were injured in the incident.
We do not tolerate violence in our jails, and the responsible persons will be sent to the police and they will have to spend more time in jail."
HMP Long Lorraine has over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous accused in the country.
In June, the prison governor was told that he had to be treated in a hospital after an attack by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot officials were called in to deal with the gruesome riots in which workers were attacked by a bridge.
A sudden flood threat to Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City due to the Rossa cyclone (possible to benefit the rainy parts)
It is rare to hit Arizona with a tropical low-pressure belt, but this is exactly what is likely to happen next week as the rosa cyclone with its remaining power is going to move southwestwards into the desert, so there is a risk of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued alerts for West Arizona, South and East Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City to be flooded suddenly on Monday and Tuesday.
It is expected to move directly towards Ross Phoenix on Tuesday, with heavy rain on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that "only ten tropical cyclones in the 200-mile area of Phoenix have maintained their status or low pressure belt since 1950!"
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
According to the latest estimate of the National Hurricane Center, 2 to 4 inches of rain will fall in Mogolon Rim, Arizona, with up to 6 inches of rain falling at a short place.
Other parts of the Desert Southwest, including Central Rockies and the Great Basin, are expected to receive between 1 and 2 inches of rain, while at a few places, up to 4 inches of rain is likely.
For those out of the danger of sudden flooding, the rain coming from the rosary will be beneficial because the region has been hit by drought.
Although floods are a matter of concern, a little rain can be beneficial as Southwest is currently facing a drought situation.
According to the U.S. Draught Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona is experiencing a low-intensity drought, the second highest category.
First, the route of the Rosa cyclone will enter the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rossa's wind speed was a maximum of 85 miles per seven on Sunday, and it was 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is facing more cold water in the Pacific, reducing its power.
In this way, they are expected to reach Mexico in the form of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rains are likely to occur in parts of Mexico, which is a significant risk of flooding.
"The area is expected to receive 3 to 6 inches of rain from California to North-West Sonor, which can fall up to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
The rosa will then make its way as a tropical storm in the north of Mexico before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning, which will then pass through the Arizona and enter the south of Utah on Tuesday night.
"Rosa or its balance influence is likely to cause severe flooding in Baja California, North-West Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said.
The rains are likely to result in landslides and landslides and landslides in the hilly areas.
Midsummer Norton attack: Four arrested on murder charges
Three minors and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempting to kill a 16-year-old boy in Somerset.
The minor boy was found in an injured condition at about 04:00 BST on Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital where his condition was stated to be "stable."
Somerset police said one 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight from the Radstoke area.
He appealed to everyone to come forward if they have any mobile footage of the incident.
Trump has accused Kevin of "selfishness and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"One vote for Justice Kevin is the rejection of the Democratic Party's ruthless and provocative conduct," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kevin has been "selfish, angry" of the Democratic Party throughout his candidacy process.
Kavanaugh, in a statement to Congress on Thursday, strongly and passionately denied allegations of sexual assault on Christian Blasey Ford when he was a teenager.
Ford also confirmed his conviction in the case.
The president said on Saturday that on that day "the American people saw the wisdom and quality and courage of Kevin."
"The opinion that confirms Justice Kevin is the most successful law expert of our time, a judge with a brilliant career in public service," he told a crowd of supporters of West Virginia.
The President spoke about the importance of Republican votes in the midterm elections, noting Kevin's candidacy.
It's been five weeks since one of the most important elections in our lives.
"I'm not standing up, but I'm standing up," he said.
That's why I'm fighting all over the place against the big candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats were on a campaign to "resist and block."
A senior GOP leadership colleague told CNN that the Senate's first major procedural vote on Kevin's candidacy is expected by Friday.
Earthquake, tsunami in Indonesia kills hundreds, death toll rises
At least 384 people were killed and many others were injured after a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the coasts of Indonesia's Sulawesi island, officials said on Saturday.
On Friday, when hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the coast of Palu, waves of six metres (18 feet) high hit the beach, many people died in the canal and the waves destroyed everything they felt.
The earthquake was followed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When there was a threat of a tsunami yesterday, people were doing their own work on the coast and they did not leave immediately and were killed," Indonesia's disaster relief agency BNPB spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho told reporters in Jakarta.
"The Tsunami did not come alone, it brought cars, ovens, houses, pulled in, it struck everything on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the Tsunami travelled at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) from the open sea before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated from 24 centres in Palu.
The aerial photographs released by the disaster prevention agency showed several buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges collapsed and collapsed, and a mosque was surrounded by water.
The city was also hit by an earthquake on Saturday.
The earthquake was felt in the region of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Assessment and Technology Application Institute (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy generated from Friday's massive earthquake was 200 times more than the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
Geography of the city, located at the edge of a long, narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami, it said.
Nugroho described the damage as "massive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some people trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings have been found, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be higher in the 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which was close to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Nogoro said there was no information from Dongguan that the communication was "completely disrupted."
More than 300,000 people were living here," the Red Cross said in a statement, and said staff and volunteers were heading towards the affected areas.
"This is already a crisis, but the situation can get worse," it said.
Officials said there had been a spate of tsunamis in the area, but the agency did not report that Palu was hit by a tsunami on Saturday.
In an amateur footage posted on social media, a man is heard warning people of a tsunami that is on the top floor of a building.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water hit the beach, and buildings and cars were washed away.
The footage could not be immediately confirmed by Reuters.
The earthquake and tsunami disrupted the power supply and disrupted communication around the school, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has started sending cargo flights from Jakarta and other cities, but the rescuers are in dire need of food and other basic amenities, officials said.
The airport has been re-opened only for relief work and will remain closed till October.
President Joko Widodo will visit rescue centres in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 800.
This is very bad.
World Vision staff have reached Palu city safely, where they have set up barricades in the premises of their office, they have seen the vandalism on the road, said Mr Doseba.
"I've seen a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
This is very bad.
While relief groups have started their preparations for disaster relief, some have complained that foreign aid workers with deep experience are being denied access to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, only foreign funds, supplies and staff can go there if the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasnt happened yet.
"Teachers are disaster-prone," said the Indonesian Red Cross spokesman, Olivia Ariani.
"Once the government said, 'Well, this is a national disaster,' then we would open up for international assistance, but that's not the case yet."
When the second night in Palu came after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and families of the missing still hope that a miracle will happen to find their loved ones because of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a child was pulled out of the gutter.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under the debris for two days with her mother's body.
Indonesian national paragliding team coach Gendon Subandono, two paragliders trained for the Asian Games held in Indonesia earlier this month, are missing.
Mr. Mandgi said the other students who were stuck at the Roa Roa hotel were students.
"As a senior in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Singh stated that within hours of the news of the Roa Roa hotel falling in the Paragliding community, he had sent a WhatsApp message in a hurry to the participants of the Bich Festival, to the Palu contestants.
However, his message, instead of the two blue openings, remained only one light mark.
"I don't think that's the message," he said.
Thieves take $26,750 to pay at an ATM in Newport on Levy
According to the Newport Police Department, the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee on Friday morning when he was making money at an ATM in Newport.
The driver of the car was vacating an ATM in the entertainment complex and preparing to bring in more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in the letter.
While he was busy, another man "runs after Brink's staff" and ran away with a bag of money for delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects running away at the spot, but the exact number of people involved in the incident was not disclosed by the police, the paper said.
If anyone has any information about their identity, contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kenny West: Rapper Changed His Name
Rapper Kenny West has changed his name.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "It was formally called Kenny West."
The 41-year-old West had a nickname for some time and had taken the title Monikar for his eighth album, which was released in June.
This change took place prior to his presentation on Satarde Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new Albany.
Singer Ariana Grande is coming to the show for "emotional reasons," the producer said.
Just as a brief account of his current business name, West previously stated that the word is important to him from a religious point of view.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West told Radio host Big Boy earlier this year when discussing his album title.
We are you, we are you, we are you.
This change has been a direct reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion and everything.
This album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
This is one of the most popular brands that have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known by various names such as Puff Daddy, P. Daddy or Didi, but this year he announced that he likes the names Love and Brother Love.
The former West coordinator, J-Z, has also made changes with or without a hyphen and capitals.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has vowed never to use the military against civilians on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of bloodshed against students.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador on Saturday promised to "never use the military to harm the Mexican people" at Letloco Plaza.
Soldiers fired on peaceful protesters on October 2, 21968, in which about 300 people were killed, during which time the left-wing student movement began to take root throughout Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans through monthly subsidies and to open more free public universities.
He said that due to unemployment and lack of educational opportunities, young children are turning to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its supply of A.I. (artificial intelligence) funds
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in the region, said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI entrepreneur, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The U.S. does not have a formal AI policy, at the same time, the U.S. government's various departments have announced about the AI.
China launched its plan last year, which aims to become No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"The double AI research budget will be a good start, because all other countries are far behind the United States, and we look forward to the next revolution in AI," Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that doubling the funding would double the chance of AI's next big success in the US.
Lee's book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published by Hutton Mifflin Harcourt this month and is the CEO of Innovation Ventures, a company that has invested in Face<0x2B><0x2B>, one of the most prominent AI companies in China.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated the top-ranked American Othello player, and later he was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee mentioned the technology challenges of the previous U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next competition would take place, so that future generations could be helped to explore.
He said that researchers in the United States have to work hard to get government subsidies.
"China is not taking away academic experts, but corporates," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired eminent people from universities to work on AI.
Lee said changes in immigration policy will also help the United States strengthen its AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be given automatically for the PhD in AI.
China's state council released its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
In the same way that the National Science Foundation in the United States and other government agencies provide funding to researchers, China's National Natural Science Foundation funds people in educational institutions, but the quality of academic work in China is low, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint artificial intelligence center, where partners in industry and education would be formed, and the White House announced the establishment of a selection committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced to invest $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
In the case of NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million annually in AI research.
A U.S. law aimed at creating a national security commission on artificial intelligence has not been approved for months.
The people of Macedonia voted to change the name of their country.
Macedonians voted Sunday to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia," a move that would resolve their decades-long dispute with Greece, as Greece banned their membership in the European Union and NATO.
There is a province in Greece called Macedonia, which insists that the name of the neighbor to its north is a claim to its territory and has used the right to deny access to NATO and the EU of that country.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the name change would make Macedonia's Slavic majority ethnic identity a reality.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and that the boycott campaign raised doubts that the number of voters would be at least 50 percent needed to make the referendum valid.
The question on the referendum ballot is: “Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership by agreeing to the agreement with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zhaev, claim that it is a cost for Macedonia to pursue accession to institutions such as the EU and NATO, a country that emerged after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came here today to vote for the future of my country, the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under a single umbrella of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Giorgioveska, a 79-year-old citizen.
Though not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have said that we shall abide by the outcome of this vote in order to decide the opinion.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The National Election Commission said that there was no irregularity till 1 pm.
But the turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters cast their votes.
"I have come out to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Jos<0xC3><0xA9> Tanevski, 62, a Skopje voter.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zhaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusseko voted in a referendum on changing the country’s name on September 30, 2018, in Sremica, Macedonia, which will open the door for NATO and the European Union to enter.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old homemaker Vladimir Kawardarkov is creating a small platform in front of tents set up for boycotting the referendum and laying chairs.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join hands with the Tathagata Mane and not with the back door," Kawardarkov said.
Our country is poor, but we are self-sufficient.
If they don't want us to accept them as Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asia coordination."
Prime Minister Zhao said that membership of NATO would bring much-needed investment in Macedonia, as it has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I think the majority will support the people because more than 80 percent of our citizens are supporters of the EU and NATO," Zhao said after the vote.
He said that if the result is "yes," it will be a confirmation of our future.
A vote published by the Institute for Policy Research in Macedonia last Monday said that 30 to 43 per cent of voters will take part in the referendum - a percentage lower than the required percentage.
In another referendum conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, 57% of the people were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 per cent said they would vote.
In order to win this election, it is necessary to have 50 per cent more votes.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first major blow to the government's policy towards the West-Political government, which came to power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City pulls out of the entire Brighton defence for the goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Stirling defeated Manchester City 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
The goal in the 65th minute was very easy.
The Argentinian striker got a pass in the midfield at the start of the order.
He ran from Bryant's three defenders before he hit Musandi in the open field.
Agartala was surrounded by four green shirts.
He hit the ball around a defender and then punched many people on the side of the Brighton box.
He then turned to his left, where there was a sledgehammer.
The English forward returned the ball using his first touch in the box, hitting Bryant's keeper Matthew Ryan on the right side of the net using the right boot.
There are some problems with the foundation of Aguero," city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We're going to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have him at the time."
But Sky Bluejana took an early lead in the first leg of the Sterling Premier League.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball inside the area of Brighton at the time.
He hit the ball to Leroy Sen on the left.
Sen took a few touches and then led towards the far post of Stirling.
This Sky Blues forward tapped into the ball net a little before going out of the boundary.
In Germany, the city will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League in Rhein-Nekar-Erina at 12:55 p.m.
Sherzer wants to play a cutie against the Rockies.
With the nationals out of the series, there was no reason to start another forceful start.
But always ready for the competition, Sherzerna is expected to face the challenge on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but will still have the advantage of playing a chain match for a game-leading Rockies against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
Rockeezny won the Nationals 5-2 on Friday night to grab a wild-card spot, but he is still looking forward to fighting for his first division book.
"While we are not playing for anything, knowing that the atmosphere in Denver will be crowded, we will be able to at least get behind the rubber and play another team at a higher level that I have not faced at any point this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but they may be allegedly inclined to let Sherzer come in at such a time.
Sherzer, who will start his 34th, had a bullpen session on Thursday and will keep an eye on his usual weekend.
The Washington Right-Hander is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA this season and has 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump's visit to West Virginia
Speaking about the importance of the Republican presence in the midterm elections, the President referred to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, who was elected by the Supreme Court.
What we're doing is going to be done in November.
We are five weeks away from the most important election in our lives.
It’s one of the biggest, biggest – I’m not fighting but I’m really fighting that’s why I’m going everywhere for big candidates.
Trump said, "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it all happening now.
And they have decided to regain power in any necessary way, you see, this selfishness, this ruthlessness.
They don't care who we've hurt, who we've beaten to gain power and control, so they want power and control, we don't give it to them."
He said the Democrats are on a campaign to "resist and block."
And you've seen it for the last four days," he said, referring to Democrats as "sensible and selfish and ruthless and ruthless."
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee's rating of Democratic Senator Diane Finstein, which was widely circulated by the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you open the file.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no, no. I wait a minute – it was a really bad body speech – the worst body speech I’ve ever seen.”
The church is no longer a church.
He does not tolerate what our hearts say
It's no surprise that some of my constituents voted against me.
Finally, I am the most recent in the Labour MP queue to be told that you are not welcome – just for speaking our minds.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment because she had taken a firm stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn in the conviction resolution.
On the importance of national security, a responsible economic policy on Europe, unfortunately, these are the same issues that Jeremy had disagreements with former leaders.
Nottingham East Labour's meeting on Friday stated that "we want to be inclusive and productive in meetings."
Most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, Friday night GC meetings were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, today, many meetings do not have such an atmosphere, and the phrase "more kind, more civilized," of politics has only been forgotten if, indeed, it began.
It is increasingly clear that the opposite views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and each opinion is being weighed on the basis of whether the party would be acceptable to the leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy Lidder became president, because I’d been surrounded by colleagues who had expressed similar political opinions before, and I’d be expected to take a stand that I would never have otherwise agreed to – be it national security or the EU single market.
When I speak publicly – and what I say doesn’t really matter – I’m being told that I should not be in the Labour Party – whether it’s a wave of slander on social media or a rejection of my choice, a protest of the Centre’s politics.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I'm more fortunate than a few of my colleagues because the reactions to me are political in nature.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of friends who don't hesitate to face the torrent of sexual or racial abuse every day.
One of the biggest disappointments in this era of politics is the normalization of the level of abuse.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should examine the culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so liberal that every party will be narrowed down with a "distrust" proposal or with a change of the rules of choice.
I've had a lot of advice over the last two years as I'm going to be "all right" with a request to keep my head down and not talk too much, followed by my "everything will be fine."
But I did not do that in politics.
As a school student 32 years ago I joined the Labour Party, as a local corporator or as a government minister, I have sought better public service supplies for those in dire need.
I have never voted in the last election.
No person in Nottingham East can be confused in any way with the position of my policies and the area of disagreement with the present leadership.
For all those who supported the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that the Brexit that the country is moving towards will adversely affect families, businesses and your social services, I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But the fact is that I have a message for the people of Nottingham, not for the people of my constituency, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise you that no amount of threats or political justifications of deputation can dissuade me from my work, which I think is in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is an MP from Nottingham East.
Iron 38 – 17 Melrose: Unearned Iron Reaches Top
The delayed two tries may have had some adverse effects on the final result, but there is no doubt that the Irons deserved a day-long win in the amazing-entertaining Tenets Premiership.
They are now at the top of the table, the only undefeated team in ten teams.
In the end, their defense was just as good as the excellent skill of taking chances, which gave the local team and coach Peter Mercchi the absolute right to be happy.
"We've had so much testing for our game and we're still undefeated, so I'm happy," he said.
Robin Christian of Melrose said: "The credit for this goes to Iron, they took advantage of opportunities better than we did."
The 14th minute of Grant Anderson's comeback by Frazier Clemos gave Ireland a lead, but a yellow card released by the Warriors to Scotland's Cap Rory Hughes earned Melrose points and Jason Baggett an undefeated trio.
Climo led Ireland with a penalty half-time, then returned to a single trial with a 17-5 lead at the break.
But Melrose made a good start in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's trial bag turned and narrowed the gap by five points.
The game was then halted for a long time due to a serious injury by Ruaridh Nott, who was taken from the stretcher and went further through the repercussions of Ire Stafford McDowell's Triela Climo.
Iron's seasonal captain, Blair McFerson was later given a yellow card, and again, Melrose took advantage of an extra player, including Bruce Colvin's Trio, at the end of the extreme stress left.
Later, the local team made a comeback, but, with a yellow card being given to Struan Hutchinson while texting the ballless Klimola from the penalty line-out, and McFerson beat the irons going forward and hit the back.
After David Armstrong's box kicker caught by Kyle Rowe and sent away for a fifth try of the local team to Flanker Gregor Henry, Climo changed him as he did during the rematch.
Steel game star is trying his career in the hotel industry.
Upon learning that Steel Game star Ford Kirnon has been appointed as the director of a licensed restaurant company, he took steps to shift to the hospitality industry.
The 56-year-old played Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, written by him and co-starred with long-time comic partner Greg Hemfeel.
The pair have announced that the upcoming ninth series of the show will be the final, and Kiran is planning his life after work in Krogling.
As per the formal record listing, he is the Director of AdrefMorne Limited.
A Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiran would join Glasgow's "foofing restaurant business," but the actor declined to comment on the issue.
‘The sea is ours’: Bolivia hopes to open the way for the Court of Justice to the Pacific.
The sailors patrol the rigging-clad at La Paz to the naval headquarters.
Flags of the sky are hoisted on public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the bottom of the sea to the Amazon, the following motto appears: “We have a right over the sea.
It is our duty to get it."
The memories of the 19th-century bloody conflict with Chile from resources in the entire landlocked Bolivia are still alive - as if there is still hope of sailing in the Pacific Ocean once again.
That hope is perhaps the highest in this decade, as Bolivia awaits a decision from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has a passion for speed, a zeal for unity and courage, and is, of course, expecting a positive result from the outcome," said Bolivia's Ambassador Roberto Cassedilla.
Many Bolivians will see ICs judgment on large screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will adjudicate Bolivia’s claims – after decades of fluctuation – Chile has accepted the obligation to negotiate an autonomous route to the sea to Bolivia.
Bolivian President Evo Morales – who is facing a controversial battle for re-election next year – is also largely dependent on Monday’s election.
At the end of August, he promised, "We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean."
But according to some analysts, the chances of the court ruling in favour of Bolivia are very low – and even if so, the situation will not change much.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to grant Chile land, and they have contracted that it will not determine the outcome of a potential negotiation.
The final debate took place just six months after the ICJ was elected, indicating that the case was "not complicated," said Paz Zarate, an expert on chili in international law.
And to move forward for Bolivia's cause, it may have been pushed back the last four years.
"The issue of obtaining a sea route has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Zarate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has ended Chile's reputation, he suggested.
At some point, Bolivia and Chile will start talking, but after that it will be very difficult to talk.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Welze, a Bolivian representative from The Hague, has rejected the view that the court’s decision-making process is unusually dynamic.
"Monday will be a wonderful opportunity for Bolivia to embark on a new era of relations with Chile," he said, adding that "there will be an opportunity to put an end to 139 years of disagreements with each other's benefits."
Morales is still one of the most popular leaders in Latin America, even though Kalzodila denied it and said he was using the maritime issue as a political slur.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to get the way of the Pacific demand," he added.
"This result is an opportunity to see what the past has to overcome."
North Korea says it will not denuclearize unless it trusts the U.S.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said that if his country does not trust Washington, it will never disarm its nuclear weapons.
He was speaking at the General Assembly.
He called upon them to abide by the commitments made by the United Nations during a meeting in Singapore during the rivals' meeting.
His opinion comes at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo along with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore stood on the verge of resuming a debacleed nuclear policy more than three months after his visit.
Ri said it was a "blindness" that upheld sanctions and U.S. objections to such a declaration, which would put an end to the Korean War and bring North Korea to the knees.
Pyongyang is aware of Washington's acceptance of the declaration without taking the first step towards significant disarmament.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are expected to hold a second summit.
But Pyongyang is seriously doubtful about leaving its scientific community, as this country considers it the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second meeting between Kim and Trump.
The fashion show in Paris showcased the latest categories such as huge to reach a major road near you.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or want full protection from the sun, don't look elsewhere.
Designers Valentino and Thom Brownie presented a range of large-sized hats for their SS19 collections, making it a guiding sight style at the Paris Fashion Week
This summer, the highly impractical hats made a presence on Instagram, and these designers sent their eye-catching creations to Katwak.
A sleek piece of valentino was an over-the-top pingt-colored hat, decorated with a wide-brimmed lumber, which nicely decorated the models' heads.
Other more-sized accessories included amulya gemstones, a magical hat and also a pineapple – but they weren’t designed to keep your head warm.
Thomas Brownie also presented a range of extraordinary masks - and that too in the time of Halloween.
There were many coloured masks sewn on the lips and they looked more like Hannibal Lake than any other style.
One structure was like the scuba diving gear, which contained haystacks and goggles, while the other looked like a dissolving ice cream cone.
And if you can use this huge fashion statement - you'll be lucky.
Those who observe these styles were predicting that a huge amount of these hats could be found on the main road near you.
The ultra-large-sized hats were seen rising on the heels of La Lamba, the straw hats with a two-foot wide stubble, Rihanna and Emily Ratazowski.
The communal gestures behind these highly impractical hats, which were named after them on social media, sent to catwalks with another large design - a straw beach bag, such as a swimsuit-trapped young model, might have taken a young child.
The black orange Raffia bag, sorted by Rafia Jhallar and with a white leather handle at the top, was the best piece in the Jakemaz La Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told Fimmel: ‘I was expecting big hats and beach bags to come on the main road for next summer – the designer made such a huge impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for this oversized device.’
John Edwards: Language skills are required for global citizens
Scotland’s independent schools maintain academic excellence, and this has also run in 2018, adding another set of unusual exam results, attributed solely to individual and collective success in sports, art, music, and other community activities.
These schools, with over 30,000 students from all over Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), which strives to provide the best quality of service for their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, for their chosen careers, and for their position as a global citizen.
As an education sector that can design and implement a pre-planned school curriculum, we are looking at modern languages as a topic of choice that is popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, "If you speak to a person in a language that he understands, it will go straight to his head."
If you speak to a person in a language that he understands, he will go straight to his heart.
It is an extremely important thing to remember that we cannot rely solely on English to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's recent exams, we can see that languages are top of the league tables with the highest pass rates among independent schools.
68% of foreign language learners received a higher grade A.
Data collected from SCIS 74 member schools showed that 72 per cent of students in Mandarin received higher grade A, 72 per cent of German learners, 69 per cent of French learners and 63 per cent of Spanish learners receiving A grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
As a matter of choice, language is now being understood in the syllabus of independent schools as well as other STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics).
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that the lack of language skills was responsible for 17 percent of the reasons given by employers for filling up vacancies.
As a result, language skills are becoming increasingly essential for young people to prepare for their future careers.
These skills have become essential in a globalized world, with more potential job opportunities requiring language.
Regardless of the career they have chosen, if they have learned another language, they can get a real benefit in the future because of their lifelong skills like this.
Due to the ability to interact directly with people from abroad, the multilingual person will automatically be placed at the forefront of the competition.
According to a 2013 Yugove survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent of people were unable to speak a foreign language fluently, and only French could be spoken by a double digit, or 15 percent of the population.
That's why it's important to invest in language learning for children.
Having multiple languages, especially those with a developing economy, will create better opportunities for children to get meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school teaches different languages.
Many schools focus on more elite modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of what your child is interested in, there are plenty of languages to choose from in independent schools, and there is also a teacher class with expertise to teach in related areas.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing an educational environment, which will prepare students and equip them with the skills to succeed even if anything in the future.
At this time, in a global business environment, one cannot deny that language is very important for the future of the country, so one must reflect in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as "international communication skills."
The independent school will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to the young people of Scotland.
Back to the B-side.
John Edwards is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his debut in San Diego on Sunday.
Fans are eagerly waiting to see LeBron James in their first match for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play against Denver Nuggets in the opening match of Sunday's season in San Diego.
It remains to be seen how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the official website of Lakers.
Mike Truddell, a reporter for Lakers, tweeted that James is likely to play a limited minute.
Earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the season-ending six games of the Lakers.
"I don't need a season to prepare for this phase of my career," he said.
Trump's rally time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump launched the campaign of Rallyes in Wheeling, West Virginia tonight.
This was the first of Trump's five scheduled rallies next week, with stops at his favoured locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the Supreme Court stalling its confirmation vote to fill the vacant seat, Trump is aiming to raise support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans fear losing control of Congress when the vote takes place in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s Wheeling, Rally in West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally live on YouTube in West Virginia.
Trump may address the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, for this week's hearing, which has been strained by allegations of sexual abuse, which has stalled the Senate's confirmation that the FBI is expected to investigate for up to a week.
But the main aim of the rally is to help the Republicans get some momentum ahead of the November elections.
Thus, Trump's campaign said that the purpose of this week's five rallies is to "encourage volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans seek to protect and grow the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters said.
"Congress control is so important to their agenda that as we move forward in this busy campaign season, the president will travel to as many states as possible," Trump's spokesman told Reuters.
This evening's rally scheduled for Vesb<0xC3><0xA1>nko Arena in Wheeling "can bring a large number of supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and get coverage from the Pittsburgh media," West Virginia Metro News said.
This will be the second visit to West Virginia in a month, from which the state won more than 40 percent of the points in 2016.
The West Virginia Republican Senate is trying to help Patrick Morrissey, who is trailing behind in the Trump election.
"This is not a good sign for Morsi that the president has to come to help him in these elections," said Simon Header, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Rider Cup 2018: The United States has struggled to keep them alive as they move into Sunday's singles.
After three one-on-one sessions, Saturday afternoon's chowkidar gave the show the desired performance.
A snooze ball is a completely invented concept in sports, but it’s one thing that the players absolutely believe in, and never more than such a competition.
Where do you think they are now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so I think we're getting a little bit of a momentum now," said Jordan Spieth, who had gone on to finish the day.
Europe is in a favorable position, of course, four points ahead and there are 12 more left in the game.
Americans seem to think, says Spieth, that there is even less wind along their way to the ball, and they have a lot to encourage, not just because of the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together throughout the day and each scored three out of four points.
Spieth has been aggressive from Tee to Green and his leadership is exemplary.
When he and Thomas were two behind, he edited all four squares, taking an important note.
While on the 15th, his pitches were responsible for winning the match, which would have made you realize that he believed the Americans were still standing in the competition.
"You've got a lot of work to do and you've got to take care of yourself," said Spencer.
All of these games are based on what's left of them.
There are 18 holes to make a mark.
The players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the storylines of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's mixed, but attractive pair scored four out of four and there was nothing wrong with it.
"Mollywood" was the only pair who couldn't shoot a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and supported Nou on Friday morning.
That run, and the enthusiasm behind the crowd cheering, seemed to be the players losing on Sunday, and as the sunset on Le Golf National began to set in, there would have been no more popular players there to sustain a possible European victory than Fleetwood and Molinari.
It's better to have both of them at the same time.
However, the story of the European Union has been delayed.
Buba Watson and Web Simpson reduced the work of Sergio Garcia, who was the hero of the morning's foreballs, when he tied up with Alex Norman.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine dots could never reach close to a hole.
On Sunday, there was no one to help you.
The reason why Foreballs and Fours were so attractive to watch closely was because of the harmony between the pairs, the advice they gave and the advice they didn't give, and the manner in which a strategy could change in an instant.
Europe played well as a team, so took a significant lead on the final day, but even in this four-day session, Team USA showed a fighting spirit for it, especially on the Stateside, where there was doubt.
Europe took a lead of 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will gain a strong advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 lead over the United States after coming out of Saturday's Fourballs and Foursomes matches.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the match with two victories over the struggling Tiger Woods and led them to four points to their uncle Le Golf National.
Losing two years ago in Hezlettian, Thomas Jorne's European team dominated the U.S. team that played poorly in the morning foreballs in an attempt to maintain the Cup.
In the first round of the competition, the Europeans won, but they failed to win.
The team needed eight points from 12 singles matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European player to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who were called "Mollywood," were the only pair to win all of their points from their opening four matches in the Ryder Cup history after a thrilling weekend.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the Foreballs, they added another 5 and 4 to the desperate Woods and America's Bryson Dashbue's Jhunjhar.
Woods, who pulled himself by two matches on Saturday, would occasionally show his talent, but out of his 29 matches in Foreballs and Fours, he has now lost 19 and seven in the line-up.
Justin Rose, who was rested in the morning's foreballs, returned to the Fours with partner Henrik Stanson and defeated world-ranked Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka 2 and 1.
There was nothing that could make Europe adapt to its climate on a windy and windy day in southwestern Paris.
Three-time champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans on Saturday with two points.
They defeated Spain's John Rahm and Ian Polter in Foreballs 2 and 1 and then defeated Poland and Rory McClaroy in 4 and 3 after losing the initial two holes in the Fours.
Although there is a need to make only one indecision to retain the title, it has been twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has bounced back from a four-point deficit while going into the singles.
After being second-best for two days, however, Sunday's counter-attack seemed to be as if they were outside of their dog.
North Korea refuses to accept any form of "unilateral disarmament"
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the United States is losing confidence in sanctions, and in such a situation, the country will not unilaterally abandon nuclear weapons.
At the annual general meeting of the World Organization, Ri Yong Ho said North Korea had taken "significant measures" in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, destroying nuclear testing sites, and pledging not to ramp up nuclear and nuclear technology.
"However, we have not received any relevant response from the U.S.," he said.
"Without any confidence in the U.S., we will not have confidence in our national security, and in such a situation, we will not disarm ourselves in the first place unilaterally in any way."
Where the step-by-step of stopping renegotiation, Steps reiterated North Korea's usual complaints about Washington's resistance, under which North Korea was to be rewarded for taking slow steps, his statement is remarkable at a time when Pyongyang did not refuse to close unilateral nuclear disarmament as it had previously done.
Rini referred to the joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the working U.S. president and North Korean leaders in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim had promised to work towards "stopping the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula," while Trump had assured North Korea's defense.
North Korea has been demanding a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang should abandon its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also called for an end to the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The U.S. is first insisting on "closing denuclearization" and is raising the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve their objectives, and is also raising objections to "declaration of an end to war," Ri said.
"It's an idea for people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that the constant restrictions are destroying our confidence."
Ri made no mention of plans for the second meeting between Kim and Trump, which U.S. leaders mentioned earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the ministers highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and said: "If South Korea had been a party to the problem of stopping nuclear proliferation and the U.S. had not been, there would have been no such thing as stopping the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."
Still, Ri's tone was dramatically different from last year when he addressed the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target the U.S. mainland, including North Korea's rockets, when "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" with a suicide goal.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage for the steps he has taken to denuclearize, but said there is still a lot of work to be done and that sanctions should continue until North Korea stops nuclear proliferation.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it, saying, "Whether it took two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia had a dispute at the UN, and Pyongyang should be rewarded for the steps taken by the Security Council.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and definitively until complete, final and verifiable cessation of denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to prevent the supply of funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and explosive missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri outside and said at the UN General Assembly that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times, but his last visit was not good.
In July, he left Pyongyang so that progress had been made, only for North Korea, within a few hours they were making "demands like goons" to make the announcement.
In a meeting with Moon earlier this month, North Korea promised that if the United States took appropriate measures, it would destroy the missile's site and, as well, nuclear complexes."
He said Kim told him that the "relevant measures" he wanted would be the security guarantee Trump promised in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking courses to get enough rest.
Harvard University is introducing a new course of getting more sleep for all its undergraduate students this year to cope with the growing masculine culture through ‘staying awake overnight’ cafe-savvy.
An academic found that when one of the world's top universities found that they were usually unaware of the context of basic information on how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chijler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has designed a curriculum that is believed to be the first of its kind in the US.
In his lecture on the impact of education on sleep deprivation, he was inspired to start this course.
“At the end of this, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why did I get this news right now, when I’m in my final year?’
She said that no one had told her about the importance of sleep – which surprised me,” she told The Telegraph.
This course, presented for the first time this year, explains how students and athletes need to have a good sleep habit to improve their performance and overall health.
Paul Bariera, a professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health care, said the university has decided to start the course after it was found that students were severely deprived of sleep over the weekend.
This one-hour course contains a series of interactive goals.
One area has an image of a dorm room, in which students are taking coffee, and the effects of caffeine and light, and how sleep deprivation had an impact on players' performance, and the importance of sleep time regulation.
In the second part, participants are being told how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons then inspires participants to think about their routines.
"We know that this will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe that they have a right to know – just as you have a right to know about the health effects of smoking,” added Professor Chijler.
There is still a culture of pride that will wake up the whole night, he said, adding that it was an increase in the emphasis on modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students, which meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Ensuring good quality, adequate sleep should be a secret weapon to overcome student stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said – also to prevent weight gain, because if the brain is deprived of sleep, it remains hungry and gives them constant hunger.
Raymond Gold, a 19-year-old professor of chemical and physical biology, helped shape the course, which he took in his first year at Harvard last year.
He said that that course opened his eyes and inspired the campus-wide curriculum.
He hopes, at the next stage, all these postgraduate students will be told that they should complete a course like this before taking admission in a competitive institution.
Professor Chijler recommended that students be alerted to when to go to sleep and when to get up, and be aware of the harmful effects of ‘blue light’ emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which will disrupt the rhythms of the clock in your body, leading to problems with falling asleep.
Livingstone 1 – 0 Rangers: Menga’s goal skyrocketed Gerard’s team
Rangers got another solid start when Dolly Menga's strike defeated Steven Gerrard's dislocated team 1-0 at Livingstone.
The iBrox team was looking for their first win in their way after a 4-1 victory at St. Johnston in February, but Gary Holt's team led to Gerard's only second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points away from the leading hearts of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Mengan hit seven minutes ahead of the half-time and never saw a team try to equalize the low-inspiring rangers.
With the Rangers now pushed to the sixth position, Livingstone has reached the third position and is only behind Hibernian on the goal difference.
And there may be another problem for the Rangers as one object was thrown from the other end as Lynsman Callum had to be treated for injuries on the head of the Spaniards.
Gerard made eight changes to his team, surpassing Ire's changes in the quarter-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, played with the same Levi 11 people, who had scored a point from the Hearts last week, and in the way that they put their competitors in the corner with their beautiful moves on each turn, he would have been very happy.
Although the Rangers held more of the ball's possession, Livingston made more use of the ball they had.
They could have scored in just two minutes when Meng's first-time lay-off sent Scott Pittman into Anne McGregor's goal but the midfielder took his big chance.
Keegan Jacobs, on the other hand, sent the free-kick to captain Craig Hollett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, came in the back-post.
The Rangers took possession but showed a lack of confidence in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morlos felt strongly that he and Steven Lawless should get a penalty on the quarter-over mark due to the collision, but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian appeal.
The Rangers could only shoot two first-half shots at the goal, but the former Ebrox goalkeeper, Liam Kelley, Lasana Colibelli's header, and Avi Ijaria's suffocating strike didn't have much to do.
Although Livi's first goal of the 34th minute was against the flow of the game, no one would doubt that he got it through hard work.
The Rangers once again failed to counter the set-piece of the Jacobs on the Deep.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Dickens Gaulger gave the ball to Scott Robinson, who quietly opted for the manga for ease of completion.
Gerard showed efficiency by calling Colibelli on Ryan Kent's spot in the break, and that change showed immediate results. Morlos on the winger passed but the colossal player came out of his line to block Kelly.
But, with Lithgow and Hollett hitting a long ball behind them, Livingston continued to force the visitors to play in their favorite way.
The Holt's team could have extended their lead in the final, but McGregor stood firmly to block the Jacobs until Lithgow came from the far corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton made a second claim late for the penultimate on the hit to Jacobs, but Thomson did not pay attention to it again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page in our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: 136 years from today, on September 30, 1882, and beyond... on this day in Germany, future physicist Jonas William "Hans" Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radiation, which was the discovery that led to the discovery of the device at the Geiger counter.
Since then, the giger counter has also become a mainstream pop culture, such as Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, in the 1950s film "Bells of Coronado" starring prominently-looking scientists such as Cowboys:
Man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "This is the giger counter, which is used to detect radioactive alkalis like uranium.
When you use this earphone, you can actually hear the sound of the atoms emitting through the radiation from the cell."
Evans: "They can be said to be popping now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the search for his name was called Immortal.
The new vaccine on cancer will teach the immune system to "learn" the evil cells
The new vaccine on cancer will teach the immune system to "see" the evil cells and kill them.
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize evil cells as part of treatment
In this method, the immune cells in the patient are removed and converted to a laboratory
They can then "push" proteins that are common to many cancers, and then re-traumatize into the body.
The vaccine has shown promising results in different cancer patients.
The vaccine, which teaches a woman's immune system to recognize bad cells, was found to have disappeared from her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
In this method, the immune cells in patients are removed and transformed into labs so that they can "eat" proteins that are common in many cancers, called HER2, and then re-scattered into the body.
J. Berzofsky, a professor at the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "causes the growth of many types of cancer," which includes breast, ovarian, lung, as well as colorectal cancer," said Professor Berzofsky.
Similarly, the approach of "teaching" the immune cells out of patients and how to attack cancer cells is helpful in a form of blood cancer.
Kenny West was seen wearing a MAGA hat after his appearance in SNL.
They didn't like
After Kenny West's bustling performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and asked him to contest the 2020 election, people flocked to his studio during Saturday Night Live.
On the night of his Ghost Town, in which he wore the Make America Great Cap, after singing a third song, he rose against the Democrats and once again expressed his support for Trump.
"How many times I spoke to a white man and he said: "How do you like Trump, they're descended from?"
So, if I were concerned about heredity, I would have left the United States long ago," he said.
SNL began the show with Matt Damon's role as a skit in which the Hollywood star sniffed out the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee for allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not aired, footage of West's Budddies was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It is not yet clear whether there was an attempt to blow up the West after posting Rock.
Also, West complained to the audience that he had to suffer behind the platform due to the hat in his head.
"They put me on the platform.
He said, 'Don't go to the platform with that hat.'
They've been bugging me!
And then he said, "I'm exhausted," he told the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say: “Have you seen the haunted place?” So he said, “I wear my Superman cap, because that means you can’t tell me what I want to do. Do you think the world should move on?”
Love to you."
His comments were aired by audiences at least twice and the cast member of SNL appeared to be Khajeel, many said, one of whom told the publication: "There was a peace of death spread throughout the studio."
West was replaced by Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West played the song I Love It in the costume of the Perrier Bottle.
West received support from the head of TPUSA, the conservative group, Condence Turner, who tweeted: "For the most courageous: Thank you for standing up for the crowd."
But the talk show's organizer, Karen Hunter, tweeted that the West was just "just as it was and it's absolutely amazing."
"But I will not reward anyone who behaves or spreads such fantasies that are harmful to my community (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his "art")."
he is free.
"We are also free," he said.
Earlier, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and is now "officially known as Kenny West."
He was not the first artist to change his name, but he followed Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puff Daddy and P Daddy.
The name of the fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg was previously Snoop Lion, and of course the former music emperor Prince, who changed his name to the symbol, and the artist was previously known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star kit harrington attacked by poisonous femininity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as John Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor criticized Mardaani's commitment to Hero, saying that such roles on the screen often make young children feel like they should be rakes to earn respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes "something is wrong" and raised the question of how to deal with the problem of toxic femininity during the <0x23>MeToo era.
Recently married to his Game of Thrones co-star, 31-year-old Rose Leslie, the kit admits that he has a 'very strong' desire to solve the problem.
"I feel very strongly at the moment - what's wrong with our sexuality," he said.
"What do we teach them about the problems we see now as we grow up?"
Kit believes that due to the extreme masculine characters on television, it is partly responsible for the increase in toxicity.
He continued: "What is born and what is taught?
Do they want young children to be men because of what is taught on TV and on the streets?
I think this is one of the biggest questions of our time - how do we change it?
There's something wrong with young people."
In the interview, he admitted that after the end of the Game of Thrones next summer, he would not be making his prequel or sequel, but he was 'scared of the Rangers and the Horses'.
From November, Kit will be working on the revival of Sam Shepherd's True West, the story of a filmmaker and his thief brother.
The actor recently revealed that the best outcome of Game of Thrones is the visit of his wife Rose.
"I met my wife on the show so she gave me my future family and my next life," he said.
In the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series, Rose played the character of Kitt's lover, John Snow.
The couple got married in June 2018 on the grounds of family property in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: The number of new cases in China has increased by 14%
China has reported a 14% increase in its HIV/AIDS population.
Health officials said more than 8,20,000 people have been infected in the country.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases have been transmitted through intercourse, which indicates changes in the past.
Traditionally, HIV was spreading rapidly due to contaminated blood being given in some parts of China.
However, Chinese health officials told a conference in the Yunnan province that the number of people infected with HIV had dropped to almost zero.
However, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 every year.
HIV infection through intercourse is a major problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been a crime in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has increased everywhere.
The findings of the study suggest that about 70-90% of men who have sex with men due to the country's conservative values eventually marry women.
The lack of protection in such relationships leads to the majority of infections.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised global availability of HIV drugs as part of its efforts to address the problem.
McKinsey Waters denied the employee broke the data of the GOP Senator and said it was a "dangerous lie" and "conspiracy theory."
U.S. Republican Mackenzie Waters on Saturday condemned her employee for posting personal information of three Republican U.S. Senators on the legislature's Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles-based Democrat asserted that the claims were aired by pundits and websites from the "right-wing group."
"False, false, and more hateful lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information published allegedly included U.S. Senators South Carolina Lindsay Graham and Utacha's Mike Lee and Orin Hatch's residential addresses and phone numbers.
Unnamed Isma on Capitol Hill appeared online on Thursday during a hearing of the Senate panel on sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The three senators, after examining Kawanu, were found to have leaked.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pandit and Redstat reported that the IP address identifying the source of the post belongs to the office of the Waters and an employee of the Waters displayed information, The Hill reported.
“These baseless allegations are completely false and baseless,” Waters added.
"A member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations - is not responsible for breaking this information in any way.
These allegations are completely false and baseless.
There was an immediate online criticism of Waters' statement, including former White House press secretary Ari Fletcher.
"It's a shame," Fletcher writes.
"It shows that her nature does not qualify to be a Congress member.
It is not right to be angry when someone is accused of something they do not do.
They should not be disturbed.
They do not want to doubt the motives of the accused.
They need to be happy and calm."
The reaction of Fleser Waters was compared to criticism of Democrat Justice Kavanaugh, who was accused of being very angry during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is contesting the mid-term elections, also shared his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's a really big thing," he said.
In his statement, Waters said his office had "informed the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies about these fraudulent claims."
"We will ensure that offenders are exposed," she said, adding, "and they will be legally held responsible for all acts that are dangerous to their destroyers and to any or all members of my staff."
John English Strikes Again Review - Less Effective Rovan Atkinson's Intelligence Irony
It is now a tradition to see the results of Brexit in any new film by the British, and this Johnny English action-comedy is also applicable to the irony franchise - which began in 2003 as Johnny English and revived in 2011 as Johnny English Ribbon.
You will be happy to know how much we are worth as a new export opportunity of the country.
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English of the rubber face has his license renewed for the second time - his name suggests that he has a huge comic creation design for those who watch movies in English.
He's certainly an idiotic secret agent who, despite being a bit like Mr. Bean, looks clausso (stupid police) and contributes a note to the Chariots of Fire theme at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
That character is based on a traveler and a mysterious international man who once played in Barclaycard TV commercials forgotten by Atkinson, and adds to his confusion.
There are also a couple of good moments in this latest JE film.
I liked the idea of John wearing a medieval armored helicopter and hitting his head with a fan's paw.
Atkins appears to be a gift of physical humor, but the humor seems strangely unnecessary in the backdrop that "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible now incorporate humor as an element.
Vinod is not meant for adults but for children, and I don't think Johnny English's eccentric accident was as imaginative and focused as Atkinson's silent-film humor in the form of a bean.
This is a common problem in Great Britain.
A cyber-hacker reveals the identity of agents on all of Britain's work by entering the super-secret web network of UK spies, which leaves the job agent amazed - a very small role for Kevin Alden.
There is a last hope before the Prime Minister, who is furious and disloyal and whose political popularity has already begun to decline: Emma Thompson has put on a very fine character like Tereza-Me, but there is not much room in the story for her to do anything else.
Her intelligence advisor suggests to her that she will have to bring someone who has retired since the information of each active intelligence is revealed.
And this means that the stupid Johnny English, currently working as a school teacher in a luxurious colony, offers a course-external lesson on how to become a spy operative: here are some cool jokes because, the English school makes an academy of rock-type spying.
English is once again called for an emergency briefing at Whitehall, and again meets with his long-time colleague, Bo, who played the role of Bell Miller.
Bo is now married, married to a submarine commander, a Jolly-Hockey-Sticks role in which the ability of an artist like Vicky Pepperdine is lost.
In every magazines secret service, Batman and Robin encounter terrible mistakes, confronting Olga Kurilenko's beautiful living woman, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, Karishma Tech, who claims that the Prime Minister can solve Britain's computer problems, comes under the threat of a multi-millionaire: the terrible Jason Volta invented by Jake Lassie.
English and Bo begin their ridiculous fun journey: in waiter's robe they set fire to a gigantic French restaurant; confused while smuggling themselves from Volt's luxurious yacht; and English finds itself chaotic by trying to put a virtual reality headset in order to familiarize themselves with Volt's interior.
For the last episode, all the scenes are drawn and shot, but it seems like a children's TV show from the kind of fun and riotous that it is.
Very good material.
And like the other Johnny English films, I was thinking: Can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role in his talent?
The Labour Party has rejected plans by the British to work four days a week and get a salary of five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party says the British government is considering a five-day salary scheme that will allow them to work four days a week.
The party allegedly feels that the company owners should transfer the money saved by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to the employees by giving them one day's extra leave.
This will give the employees three days of weeks (weeks) but will not reduce the salary.
According to the sources, the idea is in the economic agenda and policies of tilting the party's country towards the interests of its employees.
A four-day week was awarded by the Trade Union Congress as a way for employees to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour party source told The Sunday Times: "The change in policy is expected to be announced later this year.
'It will not happen overnight but a four-day work week is an aspiration which aligns with the party's vision of rehabilitating the economy in the interest of the employees as well as the party's overall industrial policy.
The Labour Party is not the first party to sponsor such an idea, the Green Party had promised a four-day working week in their campaign for the 2017 general elections.
However, this aspiration has not been fully rewarded by the Labour Party at present.
A Labour Party spokesperson said: 'The four-day working week is not the policy of the party but the party has not considered it.
John McDonnell, the finance minister, used last week's Labour Conference to explain in more detail his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was firm on pulling out of power from the "fake directors" of the services institutions and the "non-profits" of utility companies.
The scheme of the Finance Minister also means that the present investors in the water bodies cannot get back the entire share of their investments as the labour government can 'invest' on the basis of the ill-treatment seen there.
He also reiterated plans to create a Comprehensive Ownership Fund to provide 10 per cent of the private sector's shares to employees who are eligible to receive annual dividends up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy, tells 60 Minutes whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh has changed their minds
The FBI's investigation into Justice Brett Kavanaugh's allegations has delayed the final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court by at least a week, and the Bureau's findings have raised questions as to whether any Republican member of the House of Representatives could be forced to withdraw his support.
In an interview broadcast Sunday, "60 Minutes" journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham whether the FBI had found anything that could change their minds.
Kennedy spoke more openly than his colleagues in South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," Kennedy said.
"I went to the court and talked to the judge.
When all this happened, I called them and asked, ‘Why did you do this?’
He was unmistakable, unmistakable, and unmistakable."
Graham's opinion, however, seemed to be correct.
"I have made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and only one big charge can change that," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett has denied that accusation with full force," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And not everyone who called her by her name was able to recognize it.
It is 36 years old.
I don't think that's going to change anything."
Is there anything that can be done to reduce poverty?
The annual Music Festival, which will be held in New York on Saturday, will be attended by huge stars, and the goal is equally as overwhelming; eradicating global poverty.
This seventh year of the Global Citizen Festival, tens of thousands of people will gather in the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy the art of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to spread the true purpose of this festival.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international campaign group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people fighting for poverty.
To get a free entry to this forum (if you don’t want to buy a VIP entry), the audience of the show had to go through a whole series of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering to spread their global elimination goal, emailing a global leader, making a phone call, or adopting any other meaningful way.
But how much success has been achieved by the global community in the past 12 years?
The idea of organizing a free music festival for people is an honest way to motivate people to act, or just another type of so-called "clientism" that people feel makes a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters for different purposes since 2011.
He said that his actions have helped to motivate global leaders to announce pledges and policies of $3700 billion or more in funding, which will impact more than 225 crore people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group presented 390 promises and announcements arising from their actions, of which at least $1 billion has already been disbursed or compiled.
The group estimates that the funds available so far have directly impacted the lives of nearly 649 million people around the world.
Power of Nutrition is a partnership of investors and organizers in the UK, which "helps young children progress with their full potential" and those who, after more than 4700 tweets from citizens around the world, have promised to donate $35 million to that country to prevent malnutrition in Rwanda.
With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can make low-nutrition social injustice as insignificant as a grassroots in history," said Tracy Ulman, a goodwill ambassador for Power of Nutrition, in a music show in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 actions to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 50 lakh women and children with nutrition assistance.
One of the frequently asked questions on their website is "Why do you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen said: "It will be a big and difficult path - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, we will succeed in the same way as our previous common rights and anti-apartheid movements, because our strength has increased as we come together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janet Moane are among the few performers to be screened this year in New York and will be co-hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. Navy may use the U.S. Navy to "block" Russia's energy exports - Inter-Minister
Washington: US Secretary of State Ryan Zinc has said that Washington will use the navy "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy from reaching other markets, including the Middle East.
Zink has alleged that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where Russia is working at the invitation of their legitimate government - is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"They're in the Middle East because I think they want to have an energy exchange like in the southern part of Eastern Europe and Europe," said Zinke.
And according to officials, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States has the capability of navigating if necessary, along with ensuring that sea routes remain open to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinc Consumer Energy Alliance was speaking at an event organised by a profit-driven group, which calls itself the "voice of energy consumers" in the US.
He compared Washington's stances on Russia and Iran's trade and stated that they were effectively the same.
"The only cost-effective alternative is to take advantage of fuels and use of replaceable fuels, which are less expensive than Iran and Russia," he called Russia a "one-trick pony" and said Russia's economy was dependent on fossil fuels.
Trump's administration is trying to replace Russia with a cheaper alternative to European consumers by increasing its liquefied natural gas exports.
Accordingly, U.S. President Donald Trump, along with Trump administration officials, are trying to push Germany out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project. According to Trump, Moscow has "occupied" Berlin because of that project.
Moscow has reiterated that the $1100 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which will double the current pipeline capacity to 11,000 cubic meters, is a completely cost-effective project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's opposition to the project is only for economic reasons and is an example of unjust competition.
"I think we have a common view that energy cannot be a means of generating pressure and that consumers should choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting in Moscow in September with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry.
Germany's plans for the project have been met with strong opposition from the United States.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI), a leading industry body in Germany, has asked the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the two-party agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"It's a big question for me when our energy supply is interfered with by a third country," said Datter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Member of Parliament for Massachusetts said that Elizabeth Warren will "very carefully" pay attention to the 2020 presidential election.
Massachusetts MP Elizabeth Warren on Saturday said she would "carefully pay attention" to the presidential elections that come after midterm elections.
During the Town Hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider contesting the election.
"Now it's time for women to go to Washington to save their broken government and that includes the act of a woman sitting on top," she said.
"After November 6, I will pay close attention to the presidential election."
President Donald Trump was "leading this county in the wrong direction," Warren said during a debate with Trump at the Town Hall.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has made a clear statement in his criticism of Trump and Kavanaugh, who have been nominated to the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "We definitely need a FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a survey published on Thursday found that most people in Warren's own constituency did not think they would contest the 2020 presidential election.
According to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe Poll, 88% of Massachusetts voters said Warren should not contest the election.
Thirty-two percent of voters supported the measure.
The survey, which showed voter turnout, found that former governor Deval Patrick received 38 per cent support for a possible election and 48 per cent support.
Other important democratic names that were discussed in the context of the 2020 elections included Vice President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, a member of the Vermont House of Representatives.
According to the Associated Press, Biden will make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin gave the example of Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's meeting.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being listed in September.
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
"When I look at what my stomach is going through, how it is coming back, I see other families and our soldiers who are suffering from PTSD's map effects, and the injured condition they are returning to can understand their injured condition a little bit," he told the audience at Donald Trump's meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest a "deeply held elephant" and said of his son and other soldiers, "When they come back they are a little different, they come back to bite, they come back thinking about whether their soldiers and their brothers and every member of the Airmen and every member of the military have the respect they have for the country."
Track Palin was arrested in Vasila, Alaska on Monday and charged with domestic violence by interfering with reports of domestic violence and possession of drugs, police spokesman Dan Bennett said.
18 States, D.C. support the challenge to the new Asara Policy.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia have supported a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that denies shelter facilities to gangs or victims of domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed a friend-of-the-court brief in Washington on Friday to support an asylum-seeker who opposed the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace V. The information of the session suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the party policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and the children of her violent gang member" misbehaved with her but U.S. officials rejected her request for a shelter facility on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Advocates supporting Grace described Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as a country dealing with the problem of gangs and domestic violence, where the number of applicants for U.S. shelters is very large.
The U.S.'s new Asira policy pushed back a decision taken by the Board of Immigration Appeals in 2014, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for entry into the Assyr.
Attorney General Carl Resin of the District of Columbia said in a statement Friday that the new policy "has ignored many decades of state, union and international law."
"All claims for shelter under federal law must be judged according to the specific facts and circumstances in that claim, and such a ban violates that rule," said the Friend-of-the-Court Brief.
Stating that migrants are more likely to become professionals and "provide essential workers", the lawyer further argued that denial of entry to migrants was detrimental to the U.S. economy.
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered judges dealing with migrants not to allow victims of domestic violence and gang violence to enter the shelter.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their home country due to fear or persecution because of religion, religion, nationality or being a member of a particular social group or political ideology," Sessions said in a June 11 announcement on the policy.
The world has never been able to solve all the problems that people face on a daily basis, even all the serious problems.
Efforts to rescue victims due to doubling of death toll in search of survivors
The situation was worse for the living.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said, "I feel a lot of stress" when her son is suffocated at the refugee centre in Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance carries a dead body.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen picking up their water-logged belongings, trying to save anything they could find, going back to their destroyed homes.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake were flooded.
Some of the injured, including two Harris who had broken backs and shoulders, were resting outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated outside due to persistent acute repercussions.
He was struck by an earthquake that shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save yourself.
"I think I was buried under the dustbin of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had gone to the city to get married.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, but then she calmed down.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of 'slavery' with 'publicity ads'
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. daily promoting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China used the U.S. press to spread opinion on Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday accused China of manipulating the November 6 U.S. Congress elections, citing a supply of Chinese dailies in Iowa state's largest Khashoggi newspaper - Des Moines Register.
Trump's allegation that China tried to manipulate US elections is a new chapter in Washington's growing campaign to pressure China, as U.S. officials told Reuters.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to boost trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a growing trade war, resulting in a gradual levy of tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and American experts say that China's counter-offensive tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were designed to influence exporters in states such as Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party.
Iowa's longtime governor who exported large quantities of farmland to China, U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Brandt said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers, and businesses.
In an article in Sunday's Des Moines Register, Branstad writes, "China is now doubling down on bullying by promoting propaganda in our own free journalism."
"The Chinese government is taking advantage of America's cherished tradition of free speech and free journalism by offering paid advertisements in Des Moines to promote its own opinion," Branstad writes.
"On the contrary, anti-Semitism is found only in newspapers placed on the streets of Beijing for sale and does not reflect the true views of the Chinese people on China's problematic economic launch, as the media is under the strict control of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's leading newspapers dismissed the offer to publish their articles," but did not give the name of the newspaper.
Analysts have warned that Republicans are polarising women voters by defeating Cavano in the midterms
Analysts have warned that due to several top Republicans standing in and defending the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual harassment, women will be hit especially in the upcoming mid-term elections.
There is a strong consensus on this issue and the majority of Republicans are voting on it.
Those things cannot be reversed," Grant Rehar, a professor of political science at Maxwell College at Syracuse University, said in an article published Saturday in The Hill.
Reehar said there was some doubt as to whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)’s proposal for an FBI investigation would be enough to pacify angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow and they will not forget in November as well," said Carin Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokesperson for the Progressive Group.
On Friday morning, protesters in the Senate's hallway shouted "November is coming!" as Republicans controlled the Judicial Committee despite testimony from Dr. Kristin Blasey Ford.
"Democrats' enthusiasm and motivation is pulsing," a fair political analyst, Stu Rodenberg, told the news site.
“People say it’s already at the highest level; it’s true.
But it can grow even more. Especially for unstable women voters in the suburbs, as well as young voters aged 18- to 29-years-old, when the president doesn't like them, they usually don't vote."
Even before the public evidence that Ford gave details of her sexual harassment allegations against a nominee of the Supreme Court, analysts had suggested that she could be hit if Republicans agree with the confirmation.
"This is now a mess for the GOP," former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said earlier this week.
"It's not just about whether the committee's vote or the final vote or whether Cavano will be elected, it's also about how Republicans handled the matter and how they treated her," Gay Cecil, director of the Privileged USA Group, who helped the Democrats choose, told the news channel.
However, in the background of the testimony of Ford and Cavanao, there appears to be a rift among Americans about who to trust, of which Cavanao's slightly more trend appears.
While 41 percent of respondents in the new poll poll conducted by Yugoslav believe in Ford's testimony, 35 percent said they believed in Cavano either definitively or prospectively.
Also, 38 per cent of people said that while Cavano was a witness, only 30 per cent said in Ford's case that he was a liar.
Following Fleck's demand, the FBI is investigating allegations made by Ford as well as at least one other accused Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified on oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was attacked by Cavano in a drunken state when he was 17.
Ramirez alleged that while studying in Yale in the 1980s, a nominee of the Supreme Court at a party had revealed his gender to him.
World Wide Web's parent plans to launch new internet to face Google and Facebook
World Wide Web researcher Tim Berners-Lee is launching a startup that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the well-known technologist, 'Innropt', is a company that is betting on Berners-Lee's open source platform 'Solid'.
Solid allows users to choose where their data should be stored and which information should be accessed.
In a special interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee co-wrote that the previous purpose of Innrap is to "dominate the world."
"We need to do this," he said.
“This is a historic moment.
This app uses Solid’s technology to help people create their own “personal online data storage” or POD.
It may include contact lists, lists to be made, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
This means that Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all in one browser and available at the same time.
The special feature of personal online data storage is that what kind of information to handle will remain entirely in the hands of the user.
The company calls it "personal capacity through data."
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the idea is to bring resources, processes, and appropriate skills to the company in order to provide solid access to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM's security platform, staff of some developers contracted to work on the project, and the community of volunteer coders.
From this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Innerpt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team "are not talking about whether or not Facebook and Google will bring about a complete change that will make all their business models go down completely overnight."
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee writes that Inarpt's "the goal is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to help sustain the integrity and quality of the new web built on solids."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing a World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has raised an effective voice in the net neutrality debate.
Despite launching Innrapt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, The Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic for the next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard von: First World War Celebrated Victoria Cross Clarice
It was celebrated 100 years later in honour of the only priest of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross as a warrior in the First World War.
Lt. Col. The Rev. Bernard von won the prize in the attacks on the Belgians and Lehighcourts on 29 September 1918.
However, four days later, he was shot by a concealed Confederate soldier and never realized that he had received the highest honour of the British Army.
At a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday, two of his grandsons unveiled a coffin in memory of him.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vaughan, said that the unveiling of Chabutra "was very symbolic, exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning feat."
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lt. Col. von, under his leadership, crossed the canal de Saint-Quentin to the battalion "with a very dense fog and heavy firing from the battlefield and with machine guns."
They then went to the firing line and took forward the line "very bravely" before defeating the three detachments, facing the cannons on the battlefield alone.
Lt. Col. von 4 October 1918 - almost a month before the end of the war - was killed by a German sniper.
Michael Vaughan, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "one that I would never be able to do but bow down."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vaughan, also offered floral tributes after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vaughan said that he felt "very honoured to participate in the parade" and added, "The support offered by the entire community showcased the valour of an authentic heroic man."
MMA's fans woke up all night to see the Beatler 206, but instead they had to watch the Peppa Pig.
Imagine you've been up all night watching a full-blown belligerent 206, but you've refused to show the main event.
There were 13 fights in San Jose's bell, including six on the main card and would be live-streamed overnight on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6 a.m., Gerard Moussi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to face each other, rather than show their coverage, by telecasting Peppa Pig to shock viewers in the UK.
Some of the people who woke up in the morning were disappointed.
One fan wrote on Twitter, "a kind of cruel joke" about the children's cartoons.
When asked about the broadcast, "as per government regulation at 6 a.m., the content was not broadcastable, so they had to put up a children's program," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications for Belatar.
"Papp the pig, yes."
Scott Cocker, president of the company, said he would reconsider his schedule to accommodate viewers in the UK in the future.
"I think when I think of replays, we thought we could do it," Cocker said.
"But it was six o'clock in the morning on Sunday and we couldn't do it until our Sunday, that is, until Monday.
But we are working on it.
Trust me, there were a lot of messages coming after those changes and they weren't all friendly.
We were trying to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't a government issue.
I can promise this won't happen again.
We always put in five instead of six - and we tried to give more to the fans, but we failed.
It was an unfortunate situation."
Deseret Island Disclosure: Tom Daly's 'dishonesty' over sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daly says he began to feel inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but that inspired him to succeed.
The 24-year-old-Daly said, "Not everyone is like me" until I went to secondary school.
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Lavern, he said he spoke about the rights of gay people to provide "hope" to others.
He also said that being a parent has reduced his appreciation for winning the Olympics.
Cursty Young, a regular presenter of the long-running show, took several months off due to illness.
While attending Lavern's first event as an extrovert, Daly said he felt "mindfulness" when he was older than everyone else, because "love for boys and girls was not acceptable to society."
He said: "To date, this feeling of inferiority and separation has been the key things that gave me strength and power to succeed."
He wanted to show them that I am "someone," so that when people actually know about their sexuality, they won't disappoint them.
The two-time bronze medallist at the Olympics became the Daily High-profile LGBT campaigner and used his presence at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to urge more and more countries not to consider homosexuality a punishable offense.
He said that because he thought he was lucky enough to live freely without fear of the adverse consequences of his actions and wanted others to show him "hope."
The three-time world champion said Men's - met in 2013, falling in love with U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black - "they were amazing."
Daly married an Oscar winner 20 years older than him last year, but he said age difference was never a problem.
"When you've experienced so much at such a young age," he said - he participated in the Olympics for the first time when he was 14 and his father died of cancer in just three years thereafter - it's hard to find a person of this age who has seen so much ups and downs.
The couple became parents to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daly in June, and Daly said his "whole approach" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, I would have said 'I want to win a gold medal'," he said.
"The Olympics are more important than the Olympics.
"Robbie is my Olympic gold medalist.
His son Robert was named after his father, who died of brain cancer in 2011 when he was 40.
Daly said his father had not accepted that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was whether he had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I didn't dare to tell you that you can't sit in the first row, Dad," he said.
"When he took his last breath I was holding his hand and I wasn't sure he was invincible until his breath really stopped and he died," he said.
The following year, Dell won the bronze medal by participating in the 2012 Olympics.
"I knew that there couldn't be a higher feeling than what I had dreamed all my life - to dive into the Olympic Games in front of home spectators," he said.
The inspiration for his first song selection was the same - Pride by Heather Small - which matches him in preparation for the Olympics and still stands on his limbs.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 BST on Sunday.
Michaelson, who was not in form, was picked as an extra player for the Ryder Cup.
American Phil Michaelson will make a new record when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he will have to get his form back so that the milestone doesn't get too painful.
Michaelson, who has played in this biennial event 12 times in a row, is being played by captain Jim Furick as an additional player for Saturday's Fourballs and Fours.
Instead of participating in the actual game, as he has always done for the United States, this five-time major winner divided the game into a range with the hope of promoting his day and eliminating the factors that caused his game to deteriorate.
Even though his career is in full swing, 48-year-old Michaelson is not ideal for a Lee Golf National course that is disciplined, where the long elevating part never forgives the wrong shot.
And if the course itself isn't as challenging as it is, Michaelson will face the perfect British Open winner Francesco Molinari in Sunday's ninth match, who has teamed up with Rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the U.S. starts 12 singles matches behind four points, in the absence of a good start, Michaelson's match can be very important.
He didn't have much to say except that he had faith in his players.
"Today he fully understands his role, he stopped me and put his hand around my neck and said, 'I'll be ready tomorrow.'
"He has a lot of confidence.
He's the Hall of Fame and he's given these teams a lot earlier and this week.
I had no idea he was going to play two games.
I had thought more, but I decided to do it and I think we should go that way.
He wants to be there for everyone."
Michaelson will break Nick Faldo's record of most matches played at the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
Perhaps this will be the end of his Ryder Cup career that will never be able to equal the height of his personal records.
Michaelson won 18 matches, lost 20 and scored seven equalisers, said Furyk his presence gave the team an intangible value.
"He's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he likes to entertain people and he's a great person to be with the team," he explained.
"It's going to be fun for the young players, as well as what they'd like to see this week.
It's not just a game, it's more than a game."
Thomas Born, the captain of Europe, knows that the big lead may soon disappear
European captain, Thomas Bourne, knows from his experience that enough lead ahead of singles matches in the last day's Ryder Cup can easily be reversed in an uncomfortable ride.
Dane made his debut in the 1997 game at Walderrama, when a five-point lead over the Americans led by Steve Ballestor but when the matches were over, he was relegated to a victory with the lowest margin of just 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You'd have to remind yourself that we had a big lead in Valderam; in Brooklyn we had a big lead, where we lost, and Valderam we won, but only by a slight margin," Bourne said, looking at a class of 5-3 victories both on Friday and yesterday that led to a 10-6 lead at Lee Golf National.
History will show me and everyone in the team that this is not the end.
You'll have to complete it tomorrow.
Go there and do all the good things.
You won't be able to finish it until you're on the board.
Our goal is to win the trophy and that's what we're going to focus on.
I've said all the things, I focus on 12 players on our side, but we're aware of who's on our other side - the greatest players in the world."
Bourne, pleased with his performance on the tough golf course by his players, adds: "I can never get ahead of me in this.
Tomorrow's challenge is different.
Tomorrow's show is going to be different.
It’s best to play with a partner when everything is going well, but how does your ability as a golfer feel when you go there alone?
This is the message that you have to give to the players that you have to do your best tomorrow.
Now, you want to leave your partner behind and do the best for him as well."
In contrast to Bourne, the opposing side's Furyk would focus on doing better in individual performances than the pair's, with the exception of Rodon Spieth and Justin Thomas who scored three out of four points.
Furik himself faced Europe with a "miracle of the day," before that defeat, as part of the winning team on both sides of that big last-day turnaround.
In 1999, when skipper Kranshaw asked his players how they had progressed on the last day, he said, "I remember every word of it."
"Tomorrow is your 12 important matches, but you have to start as fast as you see in Brooklyn, as you see in Madinah."
When he is moving in one direction, he puts a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
We'll set up our line-up accordingly and keep our players in this pose as if we're going to do something magical tomorrow."
Thomas was sent forward on performance to try to fight back, and he wanted to face Rory McLaurroy in the top match, followed by Paul Cassie, Justin Rose, John Raham, Tommy Fleetwood, who were at the top of the other Europeans' half of the order.
"I put these players in this order because I thought they would cover all sides," Bourne said of his solo selections.
Germany's new warship has been postponed once again.
The latest German naval battleships were supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the Cold War-era warships, but due to poor systems and high prices, they won't arrive until at least next year, local media reported.
According to a military spokesman, the implementation of the "Rhyland-Faiz", the main battleship of the Baden-Württemberg-class battleground, has now been postponed to the first six months of 2019.
The ship was supposed to be commissioned in the Navy in 2014, but the future of this ambitious project was left behind due to worrying post-delivery issues.
The four Baden-Wutenberg-class ships sought by the Navy in 2007 will come to replace the Bremen-class combat bug.
It is believed that it will have a powerful cannon, anti-aircraft squad and anti-ship missile, as well as some hidden technologies such as radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include a long maintenance period - the latest combat faults should be able to be deployed away from home ports for up to two years.
However, the continued delay meant that the modern warship - the one that allowed Germany to demonstrate power at sea - had already expired when it entered service, Di Zitt reported.
The unfortunate F125 battle came to the fore last year, when German naval authorities refused to execute the ship and returned it to the Lom and Foss shipyard in Hamburg.
For the first time, the ship was returned to the shipbuilding company after delivery.
Not much is known about the reasons for the return, but German media reported several important "software and hardware faults" and that it was not useful to deploy the warship on combat missions.
The software shortages were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuttinburg-class ship would be operated by 120 sailors – half of the manpower on the combat faults in the old Bremen category.
Also, it was found that the boat is very heavy which will reduce its performance and will not make it possible for the Navy to upgrade it in the future.
The 7,000-tonne "Rhyland-Faiz" is believed to be twice as heavy as the same-range boats used by Germany in World War II.
Along with faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project - including training of the crew - has also become a problem.
It has grown from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
In the wake of Germany's declining naval power, the problems of the latest conflicts are of particular importance.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the navy was indeed "ending a fleet-worthy yacht."
The official said that the problem is growing rapidly as time goes by as the old boats were de-activated, but new ships did not arrive in their place.
He regretted that none of the fighters in the Baden-Wutemberg-class were mistakenly capable of entering the Navy.
National Trustees Have Heard of the Secret Life of Bats
New research has been conducted in the Scottish mountainous region to reveal how bats use land for food search.
It is hoped that the new invention will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
Researchers from the National Trust of Scotland will study the common and soprano pipstrells as well as brown long-eared and dobnton bats at the Inverive Gardens in Wester Ross.
In order to track the activity of bats during the entire season, special sound sensors will be placed at the free location on the property.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all acoustics will determine the frequency of the cat’s call and determine what species are doing.
A map and report of natural habitat will then be prepared to put a detailed picture of their behavior on the terrain-scale.
The NTS' Nature Conservation Advisor, Rob Dever, hopes that the results will reveal what areas of natural habitat are important for bats and how each species uses it.
This information will help in determining the benefits of the management of natural habitats such as the formation of aquatic plants and how best to maintain forest land for bats and other related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has declined significantly in the last century.
They are at risk due to loss of habitat and natural habitat affected by construction and development works.
Air turbines and lighting also pose a risk, as well as some chemical processes of flypapers and construction materials, as well as attacks of pet cats.
Cats aren't really blind.
However, their night hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes to catch prey.
They use state-of-the-art eco-location techniques to detect kidneys and blockages in their path.
The NTS, which is responsible for taking care of 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, has taken the bats very seriously.
There are ten trained specialists who regularly conduct surveys, inspect hostels and sometimes even do rescue work.
The Institute raised Scotland's first and only left-wing bat whale reserve at the Three Estates in Dumfries and Galway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten species.
David Thompson, the manager of the estate, said that the estate is the ideal territory for them.
"There is a good area for bats in the three," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and all the good natural habitat.
But, there are a lot of things about bats that are still not known, so the work we are doing here and on other property will help us understand more and more about what is needed for their breeding."
They emphasize the need to investigate bats before maintaining the property because it can lead to the extinction of the unknown single motherhood, which can lead to the death of 400 females and children, and the risk of destroying the local population as a whole.
The bats are protected and it is an offence under law to kill, torture or harass them or destroy their habitat.
The Scottish officer of the Cattle Conservation Trust, Elizabeth Ferrell, encouraged people to help.
She said: "We have a lot to complain about our bats because we don't know what the status of the population of many of our species is."
Ronaldo refutes rape allegations and lawyers prepare to file a lawsuit against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo made the rape allegations against him possible as "false news" and said people "want to propagate them" using his name.
His lawyers were preparing to file a lawsuit against Der Spiegel, the German newspaper that published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward are accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Myorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that she was fined $375,000 to keep her mouth shut about the incident.
A few hours after the claim was made, Ronaldo, 33, spoke to his 142 million followers via an instagram live video, possibly calling the news "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
"What he said today is false news," he said in front of a five-time Ballon d'Or winning camera.
They want to use my name.
Its normal.
They are trying to get fame by calling my name, but that's part of the job.
"I'm a happy guy and everything is fine," he said, laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to file a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the charges, which he says are "unacceptable reporting of suspicion in the private sector."
Lawyer Kristin Shertz said the player "can ask for compensation equivalent to the scope of the breach for moral damages, which is potentially one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent times."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at Pams Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada, after meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Myorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where he raped her in her ass.
Myorg claimed that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo took to his knees and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" and "one percent" disappointed him.
The documents claimed that Ronaldo had accepted sexual intercourse, but said it was done by mutual consent.
Myorg also claimed that she had gone to the police and that she had photographs of her wounds taken in the hospital, but then she consented to compromise outside the court-house as she felt "suddenly" and worried about being "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old Myorga says she is now evading the compromise because she is still haunted by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was preparing to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack took place, and went to Italian Giant Jew in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal this summer.
Brexit: UK's 'regrets' to be removed
Business Secretary Greg Clarke said the UK would "continue to regret" if the world leader's standards of car production were to be curtailed after Brexit.
He added that "a matter of concern" means that Toyota UK told the BBC that they would temporarily stop production at a factory in Bernston, near their Derby, if Britain exits the EU without a deal.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses due to border delays.
The Bernstein plant - where Toyota's Oris and Avensis were produced - produced about 1,50,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the European Union.
"I think we'll see production at our factory shut down if the UK leaves the EU by the end of March," said Marvin Cook, managing director of Toyota's Bernstein.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed concerns about how cross-border trade would run if they exited the EU without a contract.
For example, BMW says it will shut down its mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern of the manufacturers is that the supply chain will be at risk if no-deal Brexit takes place.
Toyota's production line runs on the principle of "near-time," where spare parts are coming from suppliers in the UK and EU every 37 minutes for cars manufactured on demand.
If the UK exits the EU without a deal before March 29, there could be ups and downs along the border, and according to the industry, there could be delays and fallbacks for the holiday parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day's worth of cargo at its Derbyshire plant, and according to the company, the production will stop.
Theresa May's checkers plan for future relations with the EU is "extremely fragmented so that those checks on the border can be avoided," Mr Clark said.
"We need a deal to be completed for us. We want a deal that is the best, like I said for the present, we don't just want to be happy with making it a success, but we need to take advantage of this opportunity," he said on BBC 4's Today Event.
"This evidence is not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, for which we need to sustain this, by which the supply chain will remain extremely successful."
Toyota could not say how long the production would last, but in the long run, it warned that increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and, of course, affect jobs.
Peter Suvllaris, who worked in Burnstone for 24 years and is a Unite Union convener at that plant, said that his members are deeply concerned: "According to my experience, once their jobs are gone, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
The White House said Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be extended again.
The White House on Sunday said Donald Trump's high-level meeting with his deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed "for another week" due to a dispute with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, whose work includes Russia's election interference, the links between Trump's allies and Russia, and an investigation into a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Rumours have been circulating in Washington for months about whether or not the Trump deputy attorney general will show up or not, and may jeopardize Mueller's independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had installed a wire to record talks with Trump, through which the president was likely to be removed by the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has denied this.
But on Monday, he went to the White House and discussed his resignation.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "wouldn't like" the expulsion of Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a confrontation with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, which would have witnessed both Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into claims against Kavanaugh, which led to further Senate votes.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News.
Asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she said: "There is no date for him, it could be this week, I think another week may be pushed back by looking at other issues that are going on with the Supreme Court.
"But I've always wanted to talk to the press."
Some journalists disputed by which this was certain: Sanders has not given details to the White House press since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders also said that TV journalists were not "obsessed" with the "performance" for the lack of reporting. "I'm not denying this reality, they're pretending."
He also suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase."
"These presidents hold more Q&A sessions than any of their predecessors," she said, and then said without giving evidence: "We have seen those figures."
Sanders said: "If journalists had the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, it would be a lot better than talking to me."
We try to do that, and you've done it before in the last few weeks, and when you can talk to the president of the United States, it's going to take the place of giving the press a statement."
Trump regularly listens to questions when he leaves the White House or attends a press conference with high-ranking officials attending an open session or visiting the White House.
There are hardly any press conferences.
This week in New York, the president may have shown cause for concern and strange presentations to reporters who may have gathered.
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU workers in NHS Scotland about Brexit concerns.
The Health Secretary wrote to the EU employees working at the NHS in Scotland to express their gratitude to the country and their willingness to live after Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP sent a letter when there was less than six months to get out of the UK EU.
The Scottish Government is already committed to meeting the cost of permanent status applications for EU citizens working in public services that are responsible for us.
In her letter, Ms Freeman writes: "Over the summer, negotiations continued between the UK and the EU on exits, which are expected to decide in the coming autumn.
However, the UK government is also preparing for the situation without a potential deal.
I know this is going to be a tough time for all of you.
For this reason, I would like to reiterate that regardless of their nationality, I consider the contribution of every member of the staff to be very multifaceted.
EU and beyond co-workers bring invaluable skills and experiences, which strengthen and improve the work of healthcare, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.
After the injury, Christine Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery.
Tennessee State Tigers Linebreaker Christian Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores in a game on Saturday.
The head coach of Tennessee State, Rod Ridney, told reporters that he had been injured just before the half-way mark.
"He came to the sideline and collapsed there," Reid said.
The trainers and medical staff provided oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before placing it on the stretcher and taking it for further diagnosis.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that he had undergone surgery at the Abercrombie Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information about the type or extent of the disease" and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student of a redshirt, was playing the first season of the Tennessee State after migrating from Illinois.
Before the current game, he had earned a total of five tackles on Saturday, making his total of 18 tackles this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged more stamp duty for buying property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will be charged more stamp duty for purchasing property in the UK and the additional money received will be used for the homeless under the New Tory scheme.
This step will open the door to the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters.
This stamp duty will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
To help the homeless - the treasury is expected to add up to <0xC2><0xA3>12 million annually.
Theresa May will announce today that she is ready to charge more stamp duty to buy property in the UK from foreign buyers and that the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The move will be perceived as an effort to overcome the campaign's success of providing more affordable homes to Jeremy Corbyn and attracting young voters with a commitment to target high-income people.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the extra money will boost the government's campaign to help people who sleep on the streets.
Surcharge: In addition to the high levels imposed on other houses two years ago, it will be in line with the present stamp duty and it will be up to 3 per cent more expensive to buy for rent.
This move is expected to add up to <0xC2><0xA3>12 million annually to the treasury.
According to an estimate, 13 percent of the newly built London properties are purchased by non-UK citizens, which increases their prices and makes it more difficult for first-time home buyers to take steps to buy a home.
Many of the wealthier areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “ghost villages” due to foreign buyers, as they spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was announced just weeks after Boris Johnson announced a stamp duty cut to help more young people buy their first home.
They accused large construction companies of buying land but not using it, so property prices rose, and they requested Mrs May to remove reservations on affordable homes, in order to eliminate "household malpractices" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn has announced a series of attention-grabbing housing reforms proposed, which include controlling rent and ending the "non-smoking" eviction.
They also want to give more power to the councils to build new houses.
Ms May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my prime ministership to the reestablishment of the dreams of the British people - a better life for every new generation.
This means that the housing market will be transformed into a housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and make a living.
However, it will not be as easy for non-residents in the UK as for British residents who work hard for companies located abroad.
For many people, the dream of owning a dream home has become far-reaching, and the unpretentiousness of those who sleep on the street has become a reality.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to become the manager of Scotland"
Sunderland owner Jack Ross said his "final goal" is to become Scotland's manager one day.
Scott, 42, is enjoying the challenges while reviving the North-East club, three points short of the top spot and third in the league one.
This summer, he led St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership, heading to the Stadium of Light.
"I wanted to play for my country.
"I got the B-cap and that's all," Ross told the BBC Scotland Sports Sound.
"But when I was a kid, I grew up watching Scotland play with my father in Hapden, and this thing has always intrigued me.
This will only happen if I succeed in my career."
Before Ross as manager of Sunderland, Dick Advocat, David Moyes, Sam Allardius, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet and Paulo de Cano were among the others.
The owner of the former Alloa Athletic said there was no fear of following such well-established names in such a big club when their proposals were rejected by Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The measure of success for me at this moment will be ""whether I take this club to the Premier League or not""."
Due to the structure and facilities within this club, this club is undoubtedly worthy of going into the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to take it there, but only if I can get the club back there, maybe I'll find myself successful."
After a 15-month period of training staff at Assistant Owners and Hearts in Dumberton, Ross's management career has only been three years.
He later helped Aloe improve to the third tier from the exit, and led St. Mirren to the Champions Cup from the possibility of exiting the latter season.
And Ross says he's more satisfied than ever with his playing career at Clyde, Hartlpool, Faulkner, St. Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
He recalled that accepting the burden of Aloe was "maybe it was really square."
"I really think management was more suitable for me, more than playing."
It sounds strange because I played the right way, made the right living from it, and enjoyed some of the top places along the way.
But it can be hard to play.
You have to do a lot of things every week.
I'm still struggling with stress and anxiety, but I'm still struggling with it.
I've always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it, and I feel most satisfied because I've been working on my own interests throughout my adult life."
You can listen to the entire interview on SportsSound between 12:00 and 13:00 BST on Sunday, September 30th, on Radio Scotland.
According to the survey, the exact time for drinking is 5.30 pm on Saturday.
The heat of summer gave rise to the British pounding, but there has been more pressure on the restaurant chain.
Pub and bar groups rose 2.7 per cent in July – but the restaurant business declined by 4.8 per cent, data showed.
Peter Martin of the Center for Professional Counseling, CGA, who has compiled data, said: "Continuous sunlight and England's longer participation in the World Cup, which also meant a repeat of the previous June month in July, with PUBG's business up 2.8 per cent, excluding the further shock that restaurants are sitting on.
In June, the restaurant's business declined by 1.8 per cent in July.
The pubs and bars that provided more drinks than the restaurant business was less.
Even the pubs that supply the substance, although not as dramatic as the restaurants run, were also weakened.
I think people just want to go out for a drink.
Sales of drinks in well-managed pubs and bars grew 6.6 per cent in the same month, while consumption fell by three per cent.
Paul Newman of RSM, a comfort and hospitality analyst, said: "We see this result as a trend that has been going on since the end of April.
When it comes to outdoor market sales, climate and important social or sports events are the most effective factors.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups are struggling, although a 4.8 per cent drop over the previous year would be particularly painful to the current cost pressures.
The long hot summer should not have come at a time when it was a difficult period for drivers selling substances and only time can tell if the medium temperature you experienced in August can provide the much-needed relief."
The overall sales growth in July among pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent, indicating a slowdown in the brand roll-out.
The Coffer Peach Tracker Industry for the UK pub, bar, and restaurant sector, with a combined turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 a century and established industry parameters, monitors the sales of 47 driver groups and analyzes them by collecting data on their performance.
One of the five children has a secret social media account, which he hides from his parents.
The survey revealed that one in five children – some at the age of 11 – has a secret social media account, which he hides from his parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students showed an increase in "fake insta" pages.
The news has sparked outrage over sexual harassment.
Twenty percent of students say that their “main” account is to show the parents.
One in five children — some at the age of 11 — are creating social media accounts that keep them secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students reveals that “fake insta” accounts are growing rapidly – a reference to photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has sparked outrage over sexual harassment.
Twenty percent of students say their cleaned “main” accounts are meant to be shown to parents, and they also have private accounts.
A mother fainted when she first heard her 13-year-old daughter's secret site urging others to "rape me."
The research conducted by the Conference of Headmasters and Headmasters of Digital Awareness UK and Independent Schools (HMC) showed that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 had two identities, and half of them admitted to maintaining a private account.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "So many teenagers are excited to create online spaces that their parents and teachers won't be able to find."
Aileen Doyle will be the "voice of the players" on the Scottish Athletics Board.
Alyiche Doyle was elected on the board of Scottish Athletics as non-executive director at the Board of Directors' Annual General Meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most famous track and field player and President Ian BT described the move as a great opportunity for those conducting the game to benefit from his extensive experience internationally over the past decade.
Ilyidh has great respect for the Scottish, UK and global players community and we are confident that bringing him on board will greatly benefit the players in Scotland," he said.
"I'm excited to be a voice for the players and I hope I can contribute and guide the sport in Scotland," Doyle said.
At the 1996 Games in Atlanta that won in 200 and 400 meters out of its four Olympic gold medals, the American has now become a regular BBC pundit, becoming unable to walk after the Transit ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctor said I would be fine or not, and only time will tell.
It was exhausting work, but I was fully recovered, learned how to walk again, and today I am practicing walking!
Thank you for the encouragement!"
Online voting broke down on the advertisement of a breast pump that compared cows to cows.
Online voting broke out on an ad that compares breastfeeding women with cow's milk displayed by a breast pump company.
Launching the pump, known as the "world's first cool-use breast pump," the consumer tech company Elvini showcased an anti-aircraft music video ad featuring the freedom of giving new pumps to breastfeeding mothers.
The four true mothers dance at the gate of the song as follows: "Yes, I give milk, but you can't see my tail" and "If you don't pay attention, they're not moving, they're my breasts."
The chorus continues to sing: "Pump it, pump it, I'm filling the baby, pump it, pump it, I'm pumping my women's milk."
However, the advertisement published on the company's Facebook page has sparked an online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of neighbors, the video received mixed reactions from the audience, with many of them saying that the milkshake industry's "treasure" has been taken very shallow.
"It's a good idea to use this product for advertising."
"With the exception of the fact that their baby is removed from them within a few days of giving birth, they become pregnant and give birth to a baby just like us," she wrote.

Another wrote: "Courage is distressing for both the mother and the baby.
"Why don't you use your mother's milk to feed your babies?"
Another wrote: "This is an unrelated advertisement."
While others supported the ad, one woman admitted that the song was "funny."
"I think it's a great idea.
If I had more breast milk, I would have taken one.
I felt like a pump.
This ad is a bit silly but I think it is the right thing to do
"It's an unusual product," one wrote.
Another commented: "This funny ad is for mothers who pump (usually in their workplace or in the bathroom) and feel like cows."
This advertisement is not an advertisement which commends or insinuates the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women are seen dancing in their arms.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the perspective of many women who use breast-pumps, who feel like cows.
However, the LV pump is completely quiet and has no wires or nozzles, and sits accurately in the nursing bra, which gives women freedom of movement, can catch children, and can even go out during pumping.
Anna Ballarin, a partner at Mother and ECD, opined: Elvi pump is a revolutionary product, which needs to be launched in an open and provocative manner.
The women who are breastfeeding and the cows in the milkhouse, the amazing sense of freedom that the new pumps are offering us, in an interesting and relevant way, had to highlight breast pumping and all its challenges.
This isn't the first time the Elves have been in the news.
During the London Fashion Week, designer Marta Zakubowski was seen using this product as a mother of two children while catwalking.
Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly to tent camps on the Texas border.
While the monthly border crossings remain relatively unchanged, the number of children detained has increased partially, as the harsh language and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to keep children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are self-immigrant and are afraid to risk their own ability to retain themselves in that country, when they come forward to accept a child.
When the federal authority announced in June that potential sponsors and other adult members of their household would have to give their fingerprints, and that data would be handed over to immigration officials, the risk increased.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs enforcement official, testified before Congress, in which he said the agency arrested some people who had applied to sponsor minors who were not accompanying him.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have prior criminal records.
"About 80 percent of people who are sponsors or have domestic members of sponsors remain illegal, and a large part of them are involved in criminal acts.
"We've been following these people," said Albion.
In order to expedite the process of children, authorities have introduced new rules, according to Shelter Workers, that some of them will have to appear in court within a month, instead of the previous standard of 60 days, since their detention.
Many will appear before the Migration Judge through video conferencing instead of appearing in person to present their pleas for legal status.
Those who are ineligible for help will be expelled from the country immediately.
According to income reports from Shelter Workers and the system in recent months, the longer the children remain in custody, the more anxious or desperate they may become, which can lead to violent tendencies or attempt to flee.
Lawyers say that those problems are rampant in large facilities such as Tornillo, where due to the large number of children there, the children who are being neglected are found to be extremely conflicting.
He further said that children being taken to Tent City are being subjected to additional trauma to children already struggling due to lack of time to be emotionally prepared or to leave their friends.
Syria has asked the US, French and Turkey to immediately leave the country.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country's war has now reached its eighth year.
Mueller, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that the foreign military presence on Syria's soil on the Sabbi in the fight against terrorism is illegal, and that "he will be dealt with appropriately."
"They should leave the country immediately and there should be no conditions for that," he said.
He stressed that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, which has killed 360,000 people since 2011, and left millions homeless.
He said that "all Syrian terrorists of the terrorist group and "no foreign existence is cleared, so long as Damascus continues to fight this holy war."
The United States has more than 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Syrian Arabs who oppose Kurdish forces and President Bashar al-Assad.
There are more than 1,000 French troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
On the question of refugees, he said the situation was conducive for them to return, but he blamed "some foreign countries" for spreading "irresponsible fears," which prompted the refugees to stay away.
"We have requested the international community and humanitarian organizations to ease the way for them to return," he said.
"What should have been purely humane, they are doing politics."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive any reconstruction assistance until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib's last major rebel stronghold has given journalists an opportunity ahead of a political war.
The Russian-Turkish deal has avoided a large-scale attack on Syria's army, which is backed by Russia, where three million people live.
However, Mauleem stressed that there was a "clear timeline" for the deal and hoped that the army's action would target jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front linked to al-Qaeda, and that they would be overthrown along with the origins.
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to hold the first meeting of a new committee formed by government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections soon.
The committee called for the inclusion of the Syrian government in the cleric, saying the panel's work should be limited to a review of the current constitution's regulations and warned against any interference.
Trump won the second term.
According to that logic, as many liberals would likely hope that his presidency would be prematurely terminated due to impeachment and the unpleasant incident, but if not, Mr. Trump will win the election again in 2020.
There is no doubt that "this will be the most dramatic presidential fight ever!"
To date, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN's prime-time ratings have doubled to 1.05 million, while MSNBC's prime-time ratings have almost tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nelson, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, rising from 1.7 million four years ago, and topped MSNBC's "The Rachel Mado Show" cable ratings, which was watched by 3.5 million viewers on Major News Nights.

Ignorance is a noble thing, which can only be afforded to spectators with privileges.
And yet, it goes from head to toe, even as a knowledgeable citizen, when you look at the panel of experts arguing at six o'clock, including Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" for his "fair" book, Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar Austrich-Latter Bomber jacket ("Jade cloth with hybrids").

When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss's house this week, his house on the north coast of Kauai had a cool sunlight and a temperature of 80 degrees, but he had himself stuck to watching MSNBC by recording CNN.
He couldn't get himself away from him, not from Brett Kavanaugh, who is ready to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court is indeterminate.
"I remember when we were doing all of those crazy programs in the daytime and people were saying, 'Western culture is beginning to come to an end'," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was kind of funny, but it turned out to be true."

In the middle of the election season, there is a lot of money to be made.
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th money is seeing flooding, which is responsible for the reorganization of congressional districts that put up two candidates in the race for the same seat.
It recently reinstated Democratic Republican Conor Lamb in the suburb of Pittsburgh district – who had won his seat from another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb stood in front of the second candidate, Republican Keith Rothfuss, currently representing the 12th district of Old Pennsylvania, which was largely occupied with the new 17th.
After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally created in favor of the Republicans, the maps were redistributed.
The race for the new 17th marked the start of an economic conflict between the main party's economic side, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after the victory in the special election in March, widely seen for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
The seat had been held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won by 20 points in that district.
Yesterday, the Democrats gave a little bit of a boost to the Democrats.
The U.S. decided to punish El Salvador, but later changed its decision.
Diplomats noted that after some withdrawal from Washington, the Dominican Republic and Panama had already ratified Beijing.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama, until the Trump Organization management team's partner was ousted.
State Department officials called off the U.S. Chief of Diplomatic Missions "on a recent decision by El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama not to recognize Taiwan," State Department spokesman Heather Neut said earlier this month.
But El Salvador had only taken into account the imposition of penalties, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, developmental and financial assistance.
The proposed penalty, which included a reduction in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would hurt this Central American country as the country has a very large number of unemployment and killings.
As the internal meeting moved forward, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to pursue a similar conference last year, which was seen as a step in the effort to prevent migrants heading towards the United States.
But by mid-September, the top administration made it clear that it wanted the council to go ahead and effectively end any penalty consideration for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will now address the summit, which is set to be held in October and mid-October, in an indication of inviting administrative areas to the conference, the diplomats said.
And without any new harsh messages or punishment from Washington, all three U.S. ambassadors quietly returned to one Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to provide details of the discussions, which were described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who had agreed to discuss the internal discussions on the terms of anonymity.
Their accounts were confirmed by an external analyst, who was close to the administration and, as such, spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next irrevocable event may be the report of Special Counsel Robert Mueller of Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, which is now very much evidence in the public record.
According to reports, Mr. Mueller is also turning his investigation, in the direction of whether there is a conspiracy of Mr. Trump's campaign, including Russia, in his attack on his election.
If Congress changes sides, Mr. Trump will see himself facing accountability in that institution, when he is ready to go to the polls again in front of voters, and perhaps eventually to the jury of his peers.
If there are too many of them, and I don’t mean that Mr Trump’s defeat is inevitable – or that his counterparts in Europe are inescapable.

The study of history was centered on the emergence of issues of such differences and the continuous march of democracy was either speeded up or delayed.
The U.S. is now dealing with some of these issues.
What would you do if Mr. Trump removed Deputy Chairman General Rod Rosenstein, who was handling Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Ever since this newspaper reported that last year, Rosenstein has been in crisis since he conceived of a secret recording of the president and that he was not fit for office.
In the opinion of Mr. Rosenston, the account of The Times is incorrect.
How will we respond to Brett Kavanaugh's new FBI investigation if it is not perfect or justifiable - or if it is decided to send him to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual misconduct and dishonesty?
Moreover, will we hold midterm elections for Congress and hold Mr. Trump accountable for this?
If we fail to do so, democracy will be left in the dark for a long time.
But I believe that you will not fail, for I have studied in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew. Due to the same Nazis, she had to migrate to Auschwitz, who once occupied my embassy.

It was only after Austria's victory in Spain this month that a dramatic draw with Villarreal has given them the strength to qualify for the Europa League grouping.
Graham Dorans could not start the season well due to a knee injury. However, with a 2-2 draw against Villarreal, Rangers should look at it as another brilliant start.
The 31-year-old said, "It was a good game for us because Villariel is a strong team.
We started the game thinking we could do better and get points.
"Maybe we could have done it in the end, but in a face-to-face unintentionally, it was often a reasonable decision.
They were probably good in the first half and we came in the latter half and got high.
It's going to be another big day in Europe.
"Hopefully we will get three points but that game will be tough because even though their scores are good in the last match, I am sure with the support of the people we have, we will definitely get a positive result.
"Last year was really tough, in all aspects, injuries and changes in the club, but still this place is a good thing.
The team is good and the kids are really enjoying it; the training is good.
Fortunately, we can try it now, put the past behind us and be successful."
The fear of retirement has made the women's section sleepy.
Despite having a clear idea of how to care for the participants of the survey, some people were talking to their family members.
Nearly half of those surveyed across the country said they were talking about the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 per cent of the people who spoke to the children said this.
“People want their family members to take care of them, but they are not taking any steps to communicate for this,” said Holly Sneader, vice president of the nationwide life insurance business.
Start from here.
Talk to your spouse and children about this: You can't prepare your family to take care of you if you haven't told them your wishes before.
Discuss with your family members about where and how to take care of these issues, so that they can be an important factor in determining the cost of your choice.
Talk to your financial advisor: A consultant can show you how to pay for these expenses.
Selecting your funds for long-term monitoring may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy, or your own insurance with your own property to help cover these expenses.
Take away your legal documents: Complete legal matters before time.
Get a health-care proxy so you can appoint a trusted person to take care of your medical care and make sure that professionals have complied with your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider the power of attorney for your financial matters.
You'll have to choose a trusted person for you and make sure your bills are paid when you're disabled.

Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a massive earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, adding the death toll could rise.
As a result of contact shock, no information was received from the Dongla Regency, which comes to the north of Palu, which is at the epicentre of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
The important facts of Palu and Dongla on Sulawesi Island are as follows:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Dongla is a regency stretching 300 km (180 mi) from the northwest coast of the island of Sulawesi.
Regency, which falls under the administrative region, had a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the mainstays of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, especially the coastal region of Dongal.
Nickel mining is also important in this region, but it is more concentrated in Moroli, on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's disaster prevention agency, the Palu and Nagolan have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, the Tsunami struck the West Dongle, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic ring of fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years are:
2004 - 26 December: A major earthquake on the west coast of Acheh Pratta in northern Sumatra, Indonesia, triggered a tsunami in 14 countries, killing 226 000 people, half of whom were in Acheah.
2005: A powerful earthquake struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude tsunami hit the south coast of Indonesia's most populous Java island, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck the Sumatra-based Mentawaibat, creating a tsunami of 10 metres high, destroying dozens of villages and killing nearly 300 people.
2016: P.D. Jaya Regency in Acheh was struck by a shallow earthquake, which destroyed a lot and created an atmosphere of fear, with the devastation of which people were reminded of the terrible earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
There was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died as a result of the collapse of the buildings.
2018: Indonesia's tourism island of Lombok is rocked by a massive earthquake that killed more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
Thousands of buildings were destroyed and thousands of tourists were stranded for some time.
Sara Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested.
According to a report released by Alaska State officials, the 29-year-old from Vasla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and for interfering with domestic violence reports and opposing arrests.
According to the police report, when a woman acquaintance tried to call the police to report the crime, he took the phone away from her.
Palin is being remanded to a Mart-Su pretrial facility and placed on a $500 non-bailable letter, KTUU reported.
In a media report, he was produced in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty" when he was questioned.
Palin faces a third-degree crime, which means he could be jailed for up to a year and face a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with second-degree murder, in which he was sentenced to one day in prison and fined $2,000.
It is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father Todd Paulin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, had called the police to lodge a complaint.
The case is currently pending in the Court of Appeals, Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, domestic violence, and substance abuse.
His friend alleged that he had hit him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups after her son had links to violent behavior with PTSD that originated from her service in Iraq in 2016.
Indonesia Earthquake Tsunami: Hundreds Killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake in Indonesia's Sulawesi island on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communication are off in the next few days and the death toll is likely to increase.
The epicentre of the earthquake is located in central Sulawesi, in the northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Videos of the incident are being circulated on social media.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach in Palamu city to celebrate when a tsunami hit the coast.
New York gang-rape accused pleads guilty to murder
Federal prosecutor Syflo Cypov in New York is demanding the death penalty for a suspected New York terrorist attack in which eight people were killed - the state government has not imposed such harsher punishments for federal crimes since 1953.
Cypov, 30, had used a rented home depot truck to attack a two-wheeler on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October.
In order to qualify for the death penalty for the purpose of awarding the death penalty, filed in the southern district of New York, prosecutors have to prove that Cypov "had" those eight victims and caused "sustainable" bodily injury.
According to judicial documents, the death penalty can be held to be admissible in both cases.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Grand Jury had slapped 22-criminal accused Cypov, which included eight counts of murder with the help of racketeering, which was generally accused of destroying federal prosecutors and motor vehicles in connection with organized crime cases.
"Describing what Cypov did as ""serious, cruel and humiliating"", the lawyer said the attack required ""significant planning and premeditation""."
"Seflo Habibulvevic Cypov hurt, harm and harm to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, An-Laure Decad, Darren Drake, Ariel Erliz, Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Ferucci, Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez Mendoza and Alejandro Damien Pagnoo".
Five of the victims were Argentinians.
New York's South District Court has ruled the death penalty for a decade.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a married couple, Julius and Ethan Rosenberg, were sentenced to death in 1953 in a New York federal trial for conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
On June 19, 1953, the Rosenberg couple was killed by an electric chair.
According to court documents, cypov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of repentance during the days of the invasion.
Police said he told investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the charge sheet, Cypov told investigators that he was inspired to attack after watching a video of the same on his mobile.
Police said he had asked for the same flag to be placed in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders who represented Cypov, said he was "completely disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We feel that the death penalty should be fixed, accepting any demand for life imprisonment is to aggravate the suffering of all those involved in the incident," Patton said.
The defence team of Cypov had earlier asked the prosecutors not to award the death sentence.
Tory said Nigel Farage should be in charge of the Brexit negotiations.
During the protest at the Tory Council, Nigel Farage vowed to establish an "Organization of People's Armies."
The former U.K. leader said that politicians should be a beacon of Euroscaptics - as suggested by Theresa May's MP, they should have the means to negotiate with the EU.
The conservative Peter Bonn told a crowd in Birmingham that if Mr. Farage was the Brexit secretary, the UK would have been 'out of the UK' by now.
However, as the Ramen Tories supporters staged a separate protest against Brexit in the city, the hurdles they faced in breaking up Mrs May's group were more apparent.
Even in the storm of criticism from Brexiters, reamers and the EU, they have to learn to stick to their checkers' pledges.
The allies say that despite opposition, they should try to establish a relationship with Brussels and put pressure on the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose one from the plan they put forth or the "goblins."
Mr. Bonn made it clear before the Live Means Leave Rally in Solihull that he wanted to 'end his relationship with the Checkers'.
He also suggested that Mr. Faraz should have accompanied him and given him responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If they had, we would have been out by now," he said.
Wellingboro’s MP said: “I’ll stand by Brexit, but we need to get the checkers out.”
Regarding his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not participate in World War II to get a second place."
We need laws in our country.
Refusing to say that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 elections, Mr. Bonn said: “The British people have changed their minds, their demands and now they want to stay in this system, it is wrong.”
Tory Brexiter Andrea Jenkins was also present at the front, speaking to reporters: "All I'll say is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
There is anger among the general public about the checkers, the opposition will not vote for them, our party and our activists who elected us to the top of the table have an anti-checkers atmosphere.
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please,
In a clear message to Mrs. May, she stated: 'He can retain his office only when the Prime Minister keeps his promises.'
Addressing Morcha, Mr. Faraz said that politicians who want to betray the 2016 referendum should take a look at it.
It is now a matter of trust between our people and our political class, he added.
They are trying to betray Brexit and we want to tell them, at this moment, that we will not let you do this.
Addressing the enthusiastic gathering here, he said: "I think you should teach this lesson to our politicians who want to betray Brexit, to those who go that way."
"We are building an army of the people of this country. It is this army that will lead us to victory in Brexit and it will not be healthy if we do not become a free, self-governing and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, Reymers held a rally in Birmingham before taking a two-hour march in the city centre.
A group of activists set up a group on the weekend and flagged the Tories Against Brexit demonstrations.
Lord Adonis, considered a friend of the Labour Party, held the Conservative Party on security issues in the party's app as the conference began.
These are the same people who tell us that the IT system is running smoothly and that all these technologies will lead to Canada plus, there will be peace on the border, free trade without the borders of Ireland, and many more like that," he said.
This is all made up.
There is no such thing as a proper Brexit,” he added.

According to The Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democrats were talking about their future plans during a townhall in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has been consistently critical of President Donald Trump, is contesting re-election in November against GOP State Representative Goff DL, who was also the co-chair of President Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There is speculation that he will be running against Trump in the 2020 election.
This was Trump's 36th meeting with voters who adopted the Townhall system after taking office in Hollyok on Saturday.
One of the members asked him if he was planning to contest the election.
Warren said, "It's time for women to go to Washigton and be the highest-ranking woman in the world to keep our disgruntled government strong."
One arrested for killing LSU's Sims
Police in Batten Rag, LA announced on Saturday that the suspect who shot and killed Yedde Sims, a basketball player from LSU, was arrested on Friday.
The baton rig police department said in an ET news conference at 11 a.m. that 20-year-old Detton Simpson had been arrested.
The police have been asked to identify the person who was seen in the video footage.
Sims, 20, was shot dead on Friday morning near the University of Southampton campus.
"Yade Sims was shot in the head and died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media, 247Sports reported.
Wyde fell in to save his friend and the Simpsons shot him.
Simpson, during the police interrogation, admitted that he was at the spot at that time, had a killer, and had fired at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was easily arrested by the police and has been placed in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims Baton Rouge, a 6-foot 6-inch junior basketball player, grew up in the small town of Rugg. He has played 32 games so far, out of which 10 started last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebounds.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton Yoo beat Sebastian Vettel to win the World Cup
It was only when the Valtteri Bottas qualified on Saturday with a score higher than Lewis Hamilton that it was clear that the Mercedes team's order would now be an important part of the tournament.
Bottas had a good start from Poll, taking Hamilton's place on the first two turns, and then it was time for Vettel to beat his own team player.
Hamilton left the end of the pack in traffic and Vettel went to the Pitts first. In fact, this action should have been decisive.
Mercedes then rebounded to Vettel's back position. However, after some very interesting moments, Hamilton moved on and Ferrari's driver had to risk a double moustache for the third position unintentionally to clear the inside.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and finished seventh at the end of the first round of the competition, painted on his 21st birthday.
However, he managed to finish the race after finishing fourth in the race, surpassing Kimi Raikkonen for the most part of the race.
He finally came in the 44th lap, but Ricci<0xC3><0xB3>n was in fourth place, making it impossible for him to increase his speed.
It was a really tough day. Voltaire has done well and he is very gentleman.
The team has done exceptionally well to get one-to-one," Hamilton said.
Its a really bad thing
US Senator Diane Feinstein has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexually harassing her, but has not brought out Ford’s letter accusing her of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the President, without directly referring to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, said that what is happening in the Senate makes it clear how 'selfish, stubborn and fickle' people have become."
"Whatever has been going on in the Senate for the last few days, what can happen... when you see the anger there, you see people like that, they are angry, they are angry, they are angry, they are selfish and they are liars."
"You look at the fame letters, she leaks and then says, 'Oh... I haven't.' "
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
"Daniel, did you do that?"
The answer to your question is, “Do you know what you’re saying?”
Oh, no.
I didn't break it."
Oh, wait a minute.
Whether we leaked it... no, we didn't do it," the president even made this statement in the style of a senator.
Feinstein had sent a letter to Ford in July and leaked it in early September, but Feinstein has denied that it was leaked from his office.
I have not concealed the allegations of Dr. Ford, but I have not leaked his letter, Feinstein told the committee, reported The Hill Reporter.
They asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it that way.
However, his refusal was not of much interest to the president. He said at a meeting on Saturday night: "I tell you, this is a very bad thing."
They may not have done it, but it's the worst behavior I've ever seen."
Appearing for a Supreme Court representative who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the President said these Democrats are using these allegations for their own benefit.
They want to get back to power.
"They don't even want to see who is hurting someone, they don't care who is suffering to gain power and supremacy," the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars defeated Belfast Giants 5-3 in the Elite League on Saturday.
The Giants were quick to take a two-goal lead as Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bouvier scored early in the match.
Before Dwayne took the Giants back to the lead, Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowney had equalised the hosts.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard equalised Dundee and then Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's goal led the team to victory.
This is Adam Kief's third loss of the season in the Elite League, before defeating Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth match between the two teams this season, with the Giants winning the last three matches.
Dwayne scored the first goal at 3:35, four minutes before the start of the game, with Kendall McPhaul hitting the ball.
In the 13:10 minute, Sullivian continued the challenge with a goal and then with the help of Matt Markardt in the 15:16 minute, the county scored to level the match.
At the end of the first session, Dwayne scored his second goal to ensure that the Giants had a lead again in the first break.
"Jayman once again scored and scored a power play goal in the 27:37 minute to put the team on the line again."
Couny and Charles Corkeran came together to help Nielsen score, and Dundee got the lead for the first time in the match at the end of the second session. He scored the fifth goal in the final session of the match to determine the team's victory.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five matches, will now play their next match against Milton Keynes on Friday at their home ground.
Air traffic controller dies of earthquake-rescuing hundreds of passengers
Indonesia's aviation regulator has confirmed that the plane carrying hundreds of passengers was flying safely.
At least 800 people have been killed and many are still missing after a powerful earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The entire area has been ravaged by strong tremors and many people have been trapped under the debris in the city of Palu.
The control at the Muttira Sis al-Jufri airport in Palu was shaken by the Manora earthquake, but 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agung refused to leave.
At the time, Batik Air Flight 6321 was on the runway and did not move from its place to make it fly safely.
He then jumped out of the vehicle after he realised that the traffic control tower was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
The decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Johannes Sirat said, according to ABC News.
We had a helicopter at Balikapapan in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost the plane this morning before it reached the airport.
"We are deeply saddened to hear this news," he said.
Meanwhile, the administration fears that the death toll will reach the thousand mark, the emergency management agency said, adding that it is difficult to reach all parts of the cities of Donggala, Singi and Boutong.
"The death toll is expected to rise further, as many bodies are still buried under the rubble and we have not been able to reach that point," the agency's spokesperson said.
The six-metre-high wave has ravaged the city of Palu, and mass burials will be held in Palu on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are supplying aid and essential supplies.
"Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old woman, told Sky News: 'Every minute the carcasses are bringing the dead bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
It's being sold in small markets."
Jane Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help the survivors but we don't know exactly what they will do there."
This situation is already very sad, but it can be very bad."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the military: "I urge you all to work day and night to complete every work related to the evacuation.
"Are you ready?" said CNN.
Earlier this year, an earthquake in Lombok, Indonesia, killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niyogini says one person is missing after the plane crashed in the Gulf.
The airline, which is operating a plane that crashed in the Gulf of Micronesia, said one passenger was missing after the crash and 47 passengers and crew on board were safely evacuated.
According to a statement issued by Air Niyugni, the company did not find a male passenger until Saturday afternoon.
We are working with local agencies, hospitals and investigating agencies to find the person, the airline said.
When asked for more details such as the age or nationality of the passenger, the airline did not immediately respond.
While trying to get to the airport on the wrong island, the plane fell into the water and local residents helped rescue the passengers and staff.
Seven people were taken to the hospital, officials said on Friday.
Six of the passengers were in the hospital on Saturday and their condition was stable, the airline said.
The exact cause of the crash is yet to be ascertained.
Both the airline and the US Navy said the aircraft had landed before reaching the runway.
Some observers believe the plane went beyond the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jensen said the plane went down very quickly.
He said: "It was a very good thing.
Jens said he and the other passengers boarded the plane and got out of the emergency exit and walked through a bucket of water.
He stated that the employees of the aircraft were scared and were shouting and he also stated that there was minor injury on their head.
The U.S. Navy said it was involved in a rescue operation, carrying people from the inflatable boat to the shore before the plane sank, and then sank in 30 metres (100 feet) of deep water.
Aviation Safety Network reported that 111 people had died in PNG-registered aircraft crashes in the last two years, but there was no aircraft of Air Niyugyani airline.
The events of the night that the woman was burnt alive have been reported by analysts.
The government on Saturday completed its arguments in a scandal involving a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, a U.S. Justice Department analyst, testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
The 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, told the jury that she and the 29-year-old Quinton Teles had examined the cellphone records to find out exactly what happened the night of her death.
"He collected location data of several cellphones to determine that he was with her that evening when Chambers died,"" said Rollett, who had earlier claimed that he was not with her that evening."
According to available data, his cellphone appeared to be near the cell phone of the chambers at the time, and Teles said he was with his friend Michael Sanford at the time. The police then went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford appeared before the court on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
The prosecutor asked Sanford about what he was claiming to be happening in a Sanford truck that night, saying that he was lying about it, and that his truck was in Nashville at the time.
Another difference is that we knew her two weeks before her death.
From the cellphone records, it appears that they started getting acquainted with each other only a week ago.
After the death of the chambers, sometime, Teles deleted all her messages, calls, contact information on her phone, Rowlett said.
"He took her out of his life," he said.
The defense will begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The case is expected to come up before the court on the same day, the judge said.
The High Breed: What is the Conscious Hip Hop?
The hip hop trio, filled with positive messages, wants to challenge the negative outlook on the music genre.
High Breed in Bristol has claimed that hip hop is riddled with its political message as well as its original purpose of handling social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and give the Conscious Hip Hop back to popularity.
Artists from groups such as Fujis and Common have seen the riots in the UK through Akala and Lockie.
Another black man?!
A nun in New York dragged a couple to court for reducing their work on the basis of a "discriminatory" message
"She is being dragged to court by a New York-based Nanny couple after her mother mistakenly removed her from her job after she sent her ""another black person""."
He has claimed that the couple has denied the allegation of racism, claiming that the suit is a type of "fraction" sought.
Lenny Plasco-Flexman, a mother of two, said she was black when the new bride, who first came to work in 2016 to take care of the children, had expressed her disapproval.
"Nassssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss is another black one" was written by 100.plasco-flxman to send a husband.
However, instead of sending the message to her husband, she mistakenly sent it to Mrs. Morris twice.
After noticing this confusion, Pasco-Flexman fired Mrs. Morris, who was previously an African-American, and she was doing poorly. So we need Filipino Nancy now, she said. The New York Post reported.
Mrs. Morris was paid one day's work and was later sent home by Uber.
Now Mrs. Morris is dragging the couple to the court for a pay cut. She is demanding a compensation of $350 per day for a six-month period, which she was hired with a full-time commitment.
"I want to show them that you can't behave like that," he told the Post newspaper on Friday.
The respective couple has denied the claim that they are racists. It is no longer possible to dislodge them on account of the hurt caused to Mrs. Morris. In such a situation, the couple has contended that it is only logical to dismiss them from service.
"My wife sent them what she didn't want to say."
It's not racist.
"We are not racists," her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
"But why should you, after you have dealt treacherously with a man, put the children in the hands of the same man?
Do you want your child to be able to take care of that person?
It's not possible."
Alleging that the case was a "serious" one, Plasco said his wife had given birth to a baby just two months ago and that she is currently "in a very difficult situation."
"Does anyone follow someone like this?"
“This is not a good thing,” said Plasco, an investment banker in the business.
Though the court case is still going on, the public opinion court has criticised the couple on social media for their behaviour and their reasoning.
Concerns that readers will not be able to accept the idea of speaking bear were swirling to Paddington publishers, a new letter said.
Soon after the book was accepted, Bond's daughter, Karen Yankel, said of the letter: "It is difficult to understand the state of mind of anyone who reads it for the first time before it is published."
It's interesting to see what we can learn from the great success of Paddington."
She says that even though the book was rejected by a father who wrote books for young children, inspired by a small bear after working as a cameraman at the BBC, she says that the 60th anniversary of the book’s publication has been “mixed” because of her death last year.
She describes Paddington as "a very important member of our family". She also said that her father was proud of the success he eventually achieved.
"They were very quiet, they never wanted to play their own team," she said.
"But Paddington was like a real existence for them, so if your son has some success, we're really proud of him, even if we don't have any achievements.
I think that's the way it looks at Patton's success.
This was their creation and their imagination, yet they always gave credit to Paddington."
My daughter was on the phone and I had to call her.
After the ladding, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur to the hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her but it was in vain.
"Nad used to call me regularly and tell me that the situation is very bad, I don't think it will come out of it," said Mr. Ednan-Laprauz.
"Then I got a call from Nad and he said she was going to die in the next two minutes and I wanted to say goodbye to her.
And I gave it to her.
I said, "I love you, baby.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The effects of drugs given by doctors to keep her heart pumping were gradually diminishing and all her systems were shutting down.
He died a short time ago and everything was gone.
I just wanted to sit back and wait and see if everything was going well.
I could not weep, nor weep, nor weep, because there were many families and people around me.
I really had to save myself.”
Hundreds. Ednan-Laparous sat on the plane with the other passengers, mourning their daughter's separation. They had no idea what kind of divine she was going through.
"No one knew," he said.
"I was in tears and my eyes were constantly on the floor.
It is a bit difficult to explain, but when I was on the plane, I felt a sense of empathy for the nada.
I needed him to understand my love.
I knew how much she loved him."
Women in distress post cards to prevent suicides from falling from the bridge.
Two women who lost their loved ones to suicide are now working to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys post inspirational messages and phone numbers on the Welsh Bridge. People can get help by calling these phone numbers.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, had been depressed since she was 13 and ended herself at the age of 18.
"I don't think it's the right time for my parents to have to deal with what I'm experiencing every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, lives in Lidney, her son, a rising chef, with a smile on his face.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
"He always wanted to be able to laugh at everything."
However, he left work before his death, because he "was living in darkness for a very long time."
Tyler committed suicide in 2014 when his 11-year-old brother saw him dead.
Mrs. David said: "I continue to be concerned that it will have some indirect impact on her."
Mrs. David created the cards, “To make these people aware that there are people you can go to, people you can talk to, they can be any of your friends.
Don’t be silent – you need to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys and Mrs. Davis have been friends for many years. Mrs. Humphreys lost their 15-year-old partner Mark. He also ended himself shortly after the death of his mother.
"He never said he was disappointed, he didn't say anything," she said.
A few days after Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He had no money in his pocket on Christmas Day - when the children were opening their presents, he avoided looking at them."
She said that her death was a big shock to her family, but we got out of it.
This broke up with us.
All we have to do is keep moving forward."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is a little left out as the FBI begins an investigation
"I thought, if we really got something like what he was asking for - the investigation that is going to be completed over a certain period of time, the limited opportunity - then maybe we could bring in a little unity," Mr. Fleck said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid he was "disagreeing" by falling into the habit of the Committee Partison gridlock.
Why does Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their desire is only due to time.
There are only six weeks left for the midterm elections, it's on November 6 - if the Republican's performance as expected gets worse, their attempt to send a man elected to the country's highest court will be much weaker.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the Senator to create a plaque of support for Mr. Kavanaugh. Mr. Kavanaugh was working for Mr. Bush at the White House and through him, Mr. Kavanaugh was introduced to his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary when Ashley was born.
What will happen when the report is submitted to the FBI?
Fifty-one Republicans and 49 Democrats will vote in the Senate.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Mike Pence, vice president, to break the parity and retain him in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Koreans under Kim's leadership has been "reduced"
South Korean lawmakers say the number of infiltrators from North Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Referring to data from the South Unification Ministry, Park Byong-sung said there were 1,227 infiltrators last year as compared to 2,706 intruders in 2011.
Mr. Park said that strict border control between North Korea and China and excessive borrowing from human traffickers was an important factor.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Many North Koreans have been granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that by the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans had illegally crossed the border.
Many have observed in China, which has a large border with North Korea, and crossing the border is easier than crossing the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers infiltrators as illegal migrants rather than migrants and forcefully repatriates them.
The relationship between the North and the South - even though technically the war is still going on - has seen significant improvement in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss non-use of nuclear power.
The meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un took place in Singapore in June after wide-ranging discussions on the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister Ri Yong-ho slammed the U.S. sanctions over the lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the United States, we will not feel confident about our national security and in such a situation, we will not be able to unilaterally disarm ourselves," Ri told the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi refers to Brett Kavanaugh as "Bebhan" and says he is unable to serve in the Supreme Court.
Home Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court-directed candidate Brett Kavanaugh a "bebhan" and said he had been unable to serve in the Supreme Court for some time.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin on Saturday.
"I can't do anything about it, but I feel that if a woman did it, she would call it 'Bebhan'," Pelosi said, referring to Kavanagh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanagh, while both of them were in their teens, emotionally denied the allegations of sexual assault against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
While speaking, Kavanaugh became very brother-in-law, talking about his family and high school days, he sometimes shouted and sometimes his throat was broken.
He accused the Democrats of "coordinated murder of bizarre and character" by coming together to express his anger over Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi has stated that Kavanagh's evidence proves that he cannot serve the Supreme Court, as he proves that he is biased in the case of Democrats.
"I think they have disqualified themselves by their statements and by following Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
They seemed reluctant when asked if Pelosi would question their legitimacy if Kavanaugh was appointed and the Democrats had a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll just say - if they don't tell the truth to the Congress or the FBI, they don't deserve it not only for the Supreme Court but also for the courts in which they are now," Pelosi said.
Kavanagh is presently a Judge in the Appellate Circuit Court of DC.
Pelosi said that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade's handling of a possible claim against her, as Kavanaugh is considered a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh gave up the question of whether he would abide by some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"This isn't the time to expect someone unconscious, biased, to go to court and hear from you, "Oh, that's awesome!"
Women need to use their arms.
This right voice has been raised, several months and years are going by and she had no choice but to cry.
"When we are angry, we cry," said Mrs. Steinme, 45 years later.
"I don't think this is normal, what do you think?"
She continued, "The woman who worked for me somewhere gave me a lot of support, she said that she was very angry that she would cry too, but she developed a technique that when she screamed and started to cry, she would say to the man who was talking, "Think I'm crying because I'm sad.
I am angry."
And then he continued.
And I thought it was incredible."
Tears are allowed as a mitigation of anger because there are fundamental misunderstandings about them.
One of the most intense memories I had about my early job is that, in a men-dominated office, where I once saw an old woman crying uncontrollably, I - a cold-blooded manager I always feared - grabbed my neck and dragged me to the gauntlet wall.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," she said.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy for that."
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congresswoman in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart to run for president.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a boat named Monkey Business, Mrs. Schroeder was very disappointed and wondered why she would not stand for the presidential election herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she said, laughing 30 years later.
"There are already seven candidates in the race and the last thing they want is another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and Seven Dorfs."
"The campaign was lagging behind in raising those funds because of the delay, and so they determined that they would not be able to get into this fight until the $2 million was due."
It was a war.
She found that her supporters paid her $250 for the men who gave her $1,000.
"Do they think I'm getting relief?" she thought to herself.
While announcing that he would not launch a formal campaign, he was so overwhelmed with emotion - gratitude for the people who supported him, enthusiasm for the system that made it difficult to raise money, and anger for representatives and sexuality rather than targeting voters.
"You might have thought I was going to be upset," Ms Schroeder said of the symbolism given to her by the newspapers.
"You might have thought that Clenix was my corporate sponsor.
I wonder what they're going to say about my writing.
"Why did she cry?"""
How the U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
Experts say Beijing's long-term relationship with the U.S. and China could be beneficial because of the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China, and because there is no sign of an end to the war.
US President Donald Trump has issued the first warning by imposing tariffs on major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
There has been a massive increase this week with new tariffs impacting $200 billion ($150 billion) worth, effectively taxing all goods coming from China to the United States.
Beijing has retaliated every time by imposing a five to ten per cent tariff on imports of the most recent 60 billion dollars of American goods.
China has vowed to step up with the US and soon the world's largest economy will never be forgotten.
Withdrawal of Washington means meeting demands, but publicly saluting the United States would be a very uncomfortable thing for Chinese President <0x58>i Jinping.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play its game properly, China can provide a long-term positive support by reducing the interoperability of the two economies due to the pressures of trade wars in the United States.
In fact, the economic upheaval that will start in either of the two countries if immediate political decisions are taken in Washington or Beijing is more dangerous than what people have taken in the past," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think-tank.
The Syrian government says it is "prepared" for the return of refugees.
Syria is ready to voluntarily return the refugees and has sought help to rebuild a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
"Today's progress in combating terrorism makes the situation in our region more stable and secure," he said.
To improve the normalcy, the government has started rehabilitating areas destroyed by terrorists.
Now all the conditions are ready to voluntarily return to the refugees who have left our country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures targeting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
More than six million people in the country are still in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would help rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the countries that provide armed assistance.
The European Cup in Paris
The 2018 Rider Cup was won by the European Union at Le Golf National outside France, Paris, by the United States from 16.5 to 10.5 points.
The United States has beaten the Europeans six times in a row and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Danish captain Thomas Björn's team reclaimed Europe's crown after beating the United States by 14.5 points.
American star Phil Mickelson struggled in a lot of competitions, drowning his T-Shot through the 16th hole to beat Francesco Molineri.
Italian golfer Molineri became the first of four players to shine in all his appearances, taking a 5-0 lead since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
Denmark's Thorbourne Olsen, the lowest-ranked player from the European Union, was knocked out by American player Jordan Spieth by a margin of 5-4 points.
The world's top-ranked player Dustin Johnson fell 2-1 behind England's Ian Polter, who may have played for the final Ryder Cup.
Experienced in eight Ryder Cups, Spain's Sergio Garcia became Europe's all-time winner with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't do anything.
This is a tough year.
Thank you for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm happy to be back in the cup.
It’s about the team and I’m happy that I’m able to help,” Emotional Garcia said after the European victory.
He handed the torch to his country's fellow John Rahm, who beat US golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in a singles game on Sunday.
The 23-year-old said: "I'm incredibly proud to beat the Tiger Woods I grew up watching.
Woods lost all his four matches in France and now holds the record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
"An odd statistic was propagated by one of the greatest players of all time, Jack Nicklaus won only 14 major titles."
With the exception of high-performance golfers Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, the USA team traveled the entire Saturday and Sunday to find Fairway.
U.S. captain Jim Furick said in a statement: "I'm proud of these people, they fought.
This morning, we tried to put pressure on the European Union.
We have fought hard.
Greetings from Thomas.
He is a good captain.
All 12 players played well.
"We will match the team again, I will work with the PGA and Ryder Cup Committee of America, and we will move forward."
I love these two guys and I'm proud to be a part of their team.
You have to praise them.
We got out.”
Red Tied Update: The concentrations of Pinelus, Manatee and Sarasota decreased significantly
According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission's latest report, there has been a general decline in red tidal concentrations in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, the status of pachyar Bloom in Pinelus, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties is being recorded - which reduces concentrations.
The Red Tide has extended the 130-mile coastline from North Pinellas to Southern Lee County.
Patches are about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but can be found in fewer sites than last week.
