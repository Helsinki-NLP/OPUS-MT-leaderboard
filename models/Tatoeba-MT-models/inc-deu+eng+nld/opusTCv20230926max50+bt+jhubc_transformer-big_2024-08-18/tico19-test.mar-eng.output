The combined incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, is increasing rapidly from January 1 to March 15, 2020.
The combined incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases is showing the same pattern in countries in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly across the country, even though the country is in different stages.
Based on Italy’s experience, the country, hospitals and intensive care centres should ramp up their preparedness for the rapidly increasing number of COVID-19 patients who will need health care and especially ultra-intensity treatment.
On December 31, 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown cell biology were found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, China's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested a new coronavirus as a pathogenic medium, now known as acute severe respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The disease is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and is known as coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
So far, evidence has shown that 80% of people affected by COVID-19 have mild illnesses, that is, respiratory infections with or without pneumonia and most of them have recovered.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 takes the form of a more serious illness that has to be hospitalized while in the remaining 6% cases, the disease is severe which requires intensive care.
The death rate of patients admitted to the hospital due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we assessed the nature of the combined incidence of COVID-19 in each country in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them to China's Hubei province.
We also compared the number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA country and the UK with cases in Italy between January 31 - March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, there was a further geographical spread of COVID-19 and the rest of the world's COVID-19 pandemic figures are now following the situation in this country.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The first case of COVID-19 in Europe was suggested by the WHO in its March 5 release of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al.
In the EU/EEA, France reported the first three confirmed cases returned from Wuhan in China's Hubei province on January 24, 2020.
As of March 15, 2020, COVID-19 cases were found in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths, including 31 December 2019 and that date, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
The number of COVID-19 cases and the number of cases.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) records COVID-19 cases from every country around the world, for which information is updated every day at 8:00 am using official sources such as countries' health ministries, national and regional health authorities, and WHO.
This data is used to evaluate the nature of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with cases in Italy.
As a sample of the scope of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases for 14 days, for which the natural transmission of COVID-19 between each EU/EEA country and the UK was considered during the period January 1 - March 15, 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of reported cases in each country at 8:00 am on 15th March 2020 and compared them with the cases in Italy during the period 31st January-15th March 2020.
COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
The overall 14-day split-up of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK is similar to Hubei Province (China) (figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and the UK, combined cases of COVID-19 began to rise around February 21 and then began to rise rapidly until February 28, 2020.
It mainly involved a rapid increase in reported cases in Italy, but was also seen in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK as a result of an increase in the combined incidence of COVID-19 (additional content).
Figure 2 shows the combined number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA country and the UK as compared to the cases in Italy between January 31 and March 15, 2020.
It highlighted that the number of cases in Italy was already reported in 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK in a period of 3 weeks or less before 8 a.m. on March 15.
Our results show that cases of COVID-19 are increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed nature of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 indicates that the pandemic is growing comparatively fast in all countries.
Apart from this, while different countries are at different stages, the gaps in national public health responses and the possible interpretation of different cases in the countries and different protocols of patient choice need to be examined for COVID-19 confirmation, including catch-up testing.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected areas of Italy described a condition that requires intensive care for 10% of COVID-19 patients and media sources have indicated that hospitals and intensive care centers in these areas have already reached their maximum potential.
The data for admission of COVID-19 patients to hospitals and/or ICUs is currently only available for 6% and 1% cases at EU/EEA levels, respectively (data not shown).
However, they need to compile the current monitoring data in a systemic manner consistent with that which will focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed that there is a huge gap in the number of intensive medical and mid-medical beds in Europe, which is 29.2 in Germany for every 100,000 population while 4.2 in Portugal.
This means that other countries have fewer or more resources than Italy (with 12.5 intensification medical and medium medical beds per 100,000 population in 2010-11).
The prevalence of COVID-19 cases admitted to hospitals in each EU/EEA country and the UK is related to the prevalence of the sample situation related to the saturation of the health care capacity <0x3E>90% of the risk of the intensive care laying capacity, as provided in the sixth update of the ECDC's rapid risk assessment of COVID-19.
Since cases are still limited to certain regions of the EU/EEA country and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care centers are providing treatment to a certain regional population, cases information and information about emergency medical centers should probably be made available within the definition of regional centers for the figure 2 (NUTS-2) level.
Italy's experience and current variants in other countries indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The country, hospitals and intensive care centres, therefore, need to prepare themselves for the continued community transmission status of SARS-CoV-2 and for the increasing number of COVID-19 patients who will need to maintain health surveillance and especially intensive care, as has been the case in the affected regions of Italy.
A quick, active and comprehensive approach to navigating, rather than preventing delays in the spread of SARS-CoV-2, as shown in the recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, is necessary, because if not implemented ahead of time, the rapid expected growth in such cases will not allow the decision-makers and hospitals to assess, accept and absorb their response.
Public health measures have also been listed in the Quick Risk Assessment to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Here is a brief period of opportunity during which countries can further enhance their efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on healthcare.
If this fails, it is likely that the health care systems of other EU/EEA countries will have to deal with the wave of patients who will need intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been caused by severe acute respiratory disease (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has so far killed more than 3,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, infecting more than 80,000 people and causing a disaster for mankind.
In 2003, SARS-CoV-2, similar to its same-sex virus that caused thousands of people to become SARS, may have been infected with bats and may have been showing similar symptoms with similar techniques.
However, the severity and mortality rate of COVID-19 is lower than that of SARS, but the infection rate is higher than that of young men and women.
This article seeks to provide a timely and inclusive review of the research topic being developed in response to the increasing number of publications on emerging diseases.
We have dealt with the fundamentals of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of disease.
Although many questions remain to be answered, we hope that this review will help in understanding and navigating this dangerous disease.
The 25th of January 2020 was an unprecedented and unforgettable one for all Chinese people who were asked to stay at home throughout the holidays due to the outbreak of the new infectious disease and for several weeks thereafter.
The virus is highly homogeneous with the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory disease (SARS) in 2003, so on February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-CoV-2 and the associated disease COVID-19.
The pandemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus had resulted in 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged and 3,000 deaths.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that COVID-19 is "the number one enemy of the people" and possibly even more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), within two months, more than 200 researches have been published on COVID-19 which includes its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment since the first case was reported on 7th January 2020, in addition to various cases through which the virus was detected
This review attempts to summarize the progress of research in new and gradually evolving subject areas.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other COV-related diseases, Middle East Respiratory Disease (MERS, 2012 outbreak).
We will also discuss what we have learned about the prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as the urgent questions that remain.
CoVs are traditionally considered non-communicable pathogens for humans, leading to about 15% of colds.
However, in this century, we have faced twice the most deadly human CoVs, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused the initial outbreak in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and quickly spread to other countries with a very deadly disorder and mortality.
The current COVID-19 outbreak is the third in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, groups of pneumonia with unknown origin were first recorded in Wuhan by the China National Health Commission on December 31, 2019.
The order of CoV was issued after seven days.
The first fatal case was reported in Wuhan on January 15, 2020.
Meanwhile, the pandemic quickly spread to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, healthcare providers were reported to have an infection that could lead to infection from humans.
On January 23, a complete lockdown was imposed in Wuhan and all public transport was suspended.
The first medical study on the disease on January 24 indicated that out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan Seafood Market, which was treated as an early infection center from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
By the time this report was published, the disease had already spread throughout China and in 50 countries around the world (figure 2.2).
As the situation is rapidly changing, the final condition and severity of the outbreak are still uncertain.
A multi-centric study of 8,866 patients with 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19 on 11 February 2020 has presented the updated picture of the pandemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-H<0x58><0x5F>rHP<0x58>a1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 has infected people of all ages, but primarily targeted people in the 30-65 age group.
Of those infected, half (47.7%) were under the age of 50, even less than 20, and only 14 were under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has spread mainly to Hubei and surrounding cities.
It takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from the onset of COVID-19 to the diagnosis.
The average holding period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average duration from transplantation to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The default reproducing number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased tremendously before January 23, 2020, which coincided with the large outbreak before the Spring Festival in China.
The fatality rate of patients with fixed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate of patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (<0x3E>60) and acute pneumonia.
CoV is a subfamily of large and overlapping viruses that contain a single thread of Sens RNA.
They can be divided into four genes, namely alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alpha- and beta-CoV are known to affect humans.
This covering spike (S) glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptides 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively, and then causes skin fusion.
Infectious RNA genomes are released into the cell membrane; after the virus genome is replicated, the genome RNA forms a virione-containing vesicle with glycoprotein and nucleocapsid proteins, which are then combined with plasma membranes to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was recorded on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be a new type of beta-CoV with a 99.98% genetic identification in 10 sequenced samples taken from the original center of the outbreak, the Huanan Seafood Market in Huan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through the transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been found in the very thin part of the human aerodynamics.
Human ACE2 has been found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 bind to human ACE2 more frailly than the S proteins of SARS-CoV, which incidentally leads to less severe infection with SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also produce new small proteins, which are encoded by orf3b, and sterilized proteins are encoded by orf8.
Orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in infectious pathogens and prevent the expression of IFN<0xC3><0x9F>; however, orf8 does not include any known functional domain or purpose.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al. indicated that the cryo-EM structure of the full-length human ACE2 at 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> resolution has been diluted with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They found that the compositions of which were open and closed, had been combined as demers and that ACE2-B0AT1 could bind to two S proteins, a compound that provides evidence of COV identification and infection.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for drug testing to overcome SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Original and Medium-sized Hosts
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originate from bats and were transmitted to humans from eaten cats and camels respectively.
After genetic comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were considered to be the local host of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% similar to SARS-like CoVs called bat-SL-CoVZ<0x58>45 and bat-SL-CoVZ<0x58>21.
However, it is unknown which medium carriers have helped the virus cross the barrier to infect humans, and the path to infection is yet to be clear.
Ji, et al., has suggested that snakes should be carriers to reach humans from bats, in which there must have been a homosexual recombination between S proteins.
According to a study by researchers in Guangzhou, China, the long nose, ant-eaten cat used in traditional medicine in China may be a possible medium host of SARS-CoV-2, for which 99% genetic similarity has been found in the mutated cat CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is still a large gap of 1% divided between the two genomes, so solid evidence is awaited for a conclusive conclusion (figure 33).
The physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet widely known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can live up to 48 hours in dry environments and can live up to 5 days in 20<0xC2><0xB0>C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar effects.
It has been suggested that SARS-CoV-2 cannot be stored in ultraviolet rays and at temperatures of 56 degrees Celsius after 30 minutes, ether, 75% ethanol, chlorinated disinfectant, paracetic acid, chloroform and chlorhexidine other membrane solvents can effectively neutralize it.
In general, the entire human race cannot cope with SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to this new virus.
At present, no detailed study has been done regarding immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
So, we can only refer to studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (figure 4).
In general, when the virus attacks the host, its first pattern is identified by the reconnaissance receptors (PRRs), which include C-type lactin-like receptors, toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-lye receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I-L receptors.
The virus through different pathways induces the expression of flammable elements, maturity of dendritic cells, and type I interferon (INN), which limits the spread of the virus and increases the speed of macrophages phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV's N proteins can help protect the virus from immune response.
Soon, favorable immune responses join the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes with CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B> T cells play an important role in the defense.
CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8<0x2B> T cells directly destroy virus-infected cells.
T-helpers produce cytokines to help protect cells.
However, COVT can inhibit cell function by involving the apoptosis of T cells.
Humoral immunity, which includes components and antibodies like C3A and C5A, is also essential in fighting viral infections.
For example, antibodies extracted from recovered patients have been shown to neutralize MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overactive response to the immune system leads to a large number of locally free cell groups that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in bad conditions can spoil various organs and even cause death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection that begins in the group is more likely to occur in older people with co-morbidities and pregnant women.
People who have other diseases or who have weakened immune systems are more likely to be infected than others.
The estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, with most cases 3-7 days, such as the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days and between 0 and 24 days.
As described above, even recent studies show that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days in the population of 8,866 cases.
Combining the effective isolation period on the basis of the most accurate incubation period is very important for healthcare authorities to prevent infected but symptomatic people from infecting others.
As a general measure, people who have come in contact with the virus or have been infected with the virus must be quarantined for at least 14 days.
Is it necessary to have a 24 day quarantine period?
A fever is a major and early symptom of COVID-19, with no symptoms such as dry cough, sore throat, muscle spasms, nausea, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients may develop dyspnea and/or hypoxemia after a week.
In severe cases, patients immediately develop severe respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and severe fever should be screened for early diagnosis of the virus, whether it is pulmonary imaging abnormality.
A demographic study conducted in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was as follows: fever at 98%, dry cough at 76%, dyspnea at 55% and diarrhoea at 3%; 8% of patients needed ventilation support.
Two recent studies on a family group and a group of people who have no symptoms have found similar findings.
Comparatively, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%) in the form of major symptoms.
However, 80% of those people needed ventilation support, which was much higher than COVID-19 patients, and the fatality rate of MERS was higher than that of COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also found in MERS patients.
Among SARS patients, it has been observed that the main symptoms were fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and sore cough (13-25%), and that about 14%-20% of the patients needed ventilation support.
By February 14, when the number of confirmed cases had reached 66,576, the COVID-19 fatality rate was 2 per cent.
As of November 2002, SARS had a fatality rate of 10 per cent of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, the fatality rate was 37% of the 2494 confirmed cases, based on a demographic study conducted in June 2012.
Previous studies had indicated that the RO of SARS-CoV-2 was higher at 6.47 and 95% of the Confidence Interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while the RO of SARS-CoV was between 2 and 4.
SARS-CoV-2 has been compared with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV with respect to symptoms, mortality and RO in Table 1.1.
The above data indicates that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher spread potential than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV but is less lethal than both.
Therefore, it is more challenging to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The collective starts most often in a single family or with a single ceremony or a single vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas or have had contact with infected persons or in the past two weeks prior to commencement.
However, it has been suggested that people can hold the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and recovered patients discharged from the hospital can carry the virus again, which has warned to extend the quarantine period.
At the initial stage, a normal or decreasing number of patients have peripheral spleen (particularly lymphocytes).
For example, in 1,099 COVID-19 patients, lymphopenia <0x3C> 4<0xC3><0x97>109/L with a positive blood pressure, including <0x3C> 1<0xC3><0x97>109/L lymphocyte numbers, and advanced aminotransferase levels and viremia were found.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin had increased in the blood of some patients, and the C-reactive protein and erythrocyte layer had increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the production of fibrin degradation in the blood had increased the level of D-dimer and the lymphocyte count had decreased rapidly.
Most COVID-19 patients had abnormalities in chest radiography, and its characteristic is pulmonary biliary patchy shadose or ground glass opacity.
Patients often develop conditional pneumonia, severe lung injury and severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive hemorrhage severely affect air exchange.
Defects in type 1 and type 2 pneumocytes reduce surface levels and increase surface tension, thus reducing the ability to transmit lung and increase the risk of developing lung damage.
Therefore, the worst radiological findings are often the most serious diseases.
The first diagnostic assessment of COVID-19 on 18th February 2020 showed that the desegregation of pneumocytes, the formation of the disinfectant membrane and the infiltration of the central lymphocyte and the multinucleated sinus in the lungs of the patient who died of the disease is consistent with the diagnosis and ARDS of viral infection of the same SARS and the ARDS
Identification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was used as the main criterion for diagnosis of COVID-19 through reverse-transcribes polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
However, the high false-negative rates that are accelerating the pandemic began the use of medical disclosures for diagnosis in China on February 13, 2020 (which no longer relies solely on RT-PCR).
A similar situation arose with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, combining the history of the disease, medical disclosure, laboratory tests and radiological findings are important and essential for effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang Group described a protocol using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to identify SARS-CoV-2, in which synthetic SARS-CoV-2 goes within an hour without the need for a wide range of tools using a dipstick.
Hopefully, if verified in medical samples, the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience.
Due to the lack of experience with the new CoV, doctors can only provide supportive monitoring to COVID-19 patients and can look at using a variety of treatment methods previously used or proposed on other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other virus diseases (Table 2).
These treatments include existing and potential treatments, including antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, cured patients' plasma, Chinese medicine, and mental support.
Not only this, the cells of the recovered patients were also proposed to be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are making rapid efforts to produce antibodies and vaccines for the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 initially attacks the lungs and possibly other organs expressing ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys, to some extent.
Therefore, the failure of the respiratory system and the failure of the respiratory system pose a major risk to the patients and it is the leading cause of death.
Therefore, the respiratory system needs to be supported to relieve symptoms and save lives, including general oxygen treatment, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should support Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technology used for malignant cardiac or respiratory disorders.
It is also important for patients with SARS-CoV-2 to maintain electrolyte balance, prevent secondary infections and septic shocks, and protect the function of the main organs in treatment.
It has been known that the additional immune response in SARS and MERS patients results in cytokine storms.
The cytokine storm is the form of a systemic progressive response that occurs due to the release of a series of cytokines that include TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune system cells to release a large number of free radicals which is the leading cause of ARDS and various organ defects.
Immunosuppression is important in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially for serious patients.
Anti-IL6 monoclonal antibodies corticosteroids and tocilizumab are used to treat cytokine storms.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine storms include T-cell-directed immune response, IFN-Y, IL-1 and TNF inhibitors, JAK inhibitors, blytomob, suppressors of cytokine signaling 4, and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids are widely used as immunosuppressants in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory harm.
However, high levels of steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, especially osteonecrosis, which can significantly affect the diagnosis.
However, short treatment of corticosteroids in a range of low to medium doses is recommended for critically ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing this, no effective antiviral treatment was confirmed.
However, an American patient suffering from COVID-19 has been found to be effective after being given a remdesivir through a vein.
Remdesivir is a unique antiviral drug developed by Glid to treat diseases caused by Ebola and the Marlburg virus.
Later, Remdesivir showed potential barriers to other single stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Jilled provided these ingredients to China for testing patients suffering from SARS-CoV-2, and the findings were very promising.
Along with this, BaricitNB, Interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, and Ribavirin have been prescribed as possible treatment for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
The combined treatment of Lopinavari/Ritonavir can cause diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions.
The effect of these treatments on other drugs used in patients needs to be carefully monitored.
The production of plasma and antibodies from recovered patients
The blood of patients recovering from communicable diseases has a long history of collecting to treat patients suffering from the same disease or to prevent healthy people from getting sick.
It is true that the blood of recovered patients has a higher number of antibodies than that of pathogens.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (IGs) that are produced by B lymphocytes and they identify specific molecules in pathogens and directly destroy them.
On this basis, cells were collected from the blood of the group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and 10 patients who were critically ill were discharged.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, as well as reduced inflammatory and viral pressure, and improved the circulatory system in the blood.
However, until specific treatment methods are developed, a large-scale verification and explanation is required.
Also, some of the disadvantages associated with cells need to be carefully considered for therapeutic effects.
For example, antibodies can greatly stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially deadly in nature.
Concentration of blood vessels is generally low and there is a large demand for cells to treat a critically ill patient.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies rapidly in the fight against the global pandemic.
Therefore, it is important and practical to separate B cells from the recovered patients and identify the genetic codes that encode the effective antibodies or examine the effective antibodies against the essential proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can increase the production of antibodies rapidly.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its effect depends largely on the combination of different components of the formula according to the theory of TCM's diagnosis of the disease.
Most of the effective components are unknown or uncertain because it is difficult to remove and verify such elements or their highest combination.
With a lack of effective and specific treatment methods for COVID-19, TCM has become an alternative treatment option for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for patients who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, Shu Feng Ji Du Capsules and Lian Hua King Wen capsules have been found to be effective for COVID-19 patients.
While 87% of patients who used TCM for treatment of COVID-19 showed higher recovery rates in various regions of China, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), Hubei Province, where only 30% of COVID-19 patients were using TCM was found to be the lowest (13%).
However, this is a somewhat broad comparison as other impact factors such as the number and intensity of patients should be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Bid Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing only Western Medicine (WM) with the combined treatment of WM and TCM.
They found that the duration of relapse of body temperature, symptoms and hospitalization was much lower in the WM<0x2B> TCM group than in the WM group alone.
Most importantly, the symptomatic growth rate (symptomatic to acute) was much lower in WM<0x2B>TCM than in WM group (7.4% versus 46.2%) and the mortality rate in WM<0x2B>TCM group was also lower than WM group (8.8% versus 39%).
However, large-scale surveillance tests for the effectiveness and safety of TCM need to be carried out in more centres.
It would be somewhat strange to define the mechanism of action and explain the components of TCM treatment or their combination, if possible.
Patients with suspected or certain COVID-19 experience most of the highly contagious or deadly disease, and people in isolation also experience boredom, loneliness, and anger.
Also, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough as well as adverse effects of treatment such as sleep deprivation caused by corticosteroids can lead to anxiety and mental depression.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, emotional disorders such as persistent depression, anxiety, panic shock, psychosis, Durmansk symptoms, delusions, and suicidal feelings were reported.
The mandatory tracking and isolation of contacts as part of a public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak may lead to people becoming more concerned about infection, isolation, and convictions in family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care must be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected persons and those in contact with them as well as to the general public in need.
Mental support includes setting up of a multifaceted mental health group, accurate news and treatment plans on the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, regular and clear communication on the use of commercial electrical devices and the use of applications to avoid close contact with others.
The vaccine needs to be effective in breaking the chain of transmission from animal to animal, and it can also be used for anti-viral treatment to control the epidemic caused by the emerging virus.
Efforts are being made to develop a protein-based vaccine to produce long-term and qualitative antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live-poor vaccines for SARS were evaluated on animal samples.
However, before the start of medical studies, the vaccine candidate has yet to discover the physical efficacy and lethal challenge patterns in adults and the protective components against animal-spreading virus infection.
The reason for this may be that the effect of SARS ended 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
In contrast, rare cases and some mass events of MERS have originated in the eastern countries and continue to spread to other regions, showing that animal-spreading sources exist in the epidemiological region.
Vaccination policy for MERS was formulated using ineffective virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, microbes, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits and some were evaluated on animal samples.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and important task for the current pandemic.
However, overcoming the difficulties is challenging because it is necessary to develop the vaccine and for the dynamic diversity of CoV to last a long time (around 18 months).
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to show its full medical order in thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient can recover slowly without any recurrence.
However, just like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high prevalence and mortality in severe cases.
Therefore, healthcare institutions need to set up a diagnostic model to prioritize their services, especially in resource-free areas.
The following factors may or may affect the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients based on medical studies so far indicated (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the diagnosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
In the study of 8,866 cases as described above, 47.7% of the patients who were over 50 years of age with COVID-19 were between 30-65 years of age.
Patients who need intensive therapy were more likely to have implicit disorders and complications and were much older than those who did not (at the middle age of 66 compared to 51), suggesting age as a diagnostic factor for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infects men more than women (0.31/1,00,000 vs. 0.27/1,00,000) as described above.
Coeliacs and complications: A COVID-19 patient in need of an ICU is most likely to suffer from serious heart disease and rhythm problems.
Heart disease is also one of the leading causes of death in SARS patients.
It has also been suggested that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE-2 positive cholangiocetes, which can lead to liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to mention that the relationship between age and current diseases is important and can affect each other.
Unusual laboratory findings: C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the blood indicate the severity of inflammatory or tissue injury and are a potential longitudinal diagnostic factor for disease, treatment, and final recovery.
The severity of COVID-19 and the correlation of CRP levels with pathogens have also been indicated.
Along with this, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine kinase (CK) can also help to predict the outcome.
These hormones are widely expressed in various organs, especially in the heart and liver and in the loss of tissues.
Therefore, they are traditional spectators for heart or liver disorders.
Major medical symptoms: Chest radiography and a transient increase in medical symptoms should be considered together with other problems to predict the findings and complications of COVID-19.
Use of Steroids: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are used in the form of ancillary treatments for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory harm.
With high doses of corticosteroids being widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors have suffered from non-vascular osteoarthritis, including a lifetime of disability and reduced lifespan.
Therefore, steroids should be used in low doses and short-term if needed in COVID-19 patients.
Mental Stress: As described above, many patients suffered from additional stress during the outbreak of COVID-19 because they had to remain in isolation and in a very uncertain state for a long time and witnessed the deaths of family members and siblings.
It is imperative to provide mental counseling and long-term support so that they recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, the characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic look different than those of SARS.
The recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 can occur more efficiently in the upper respiratory tract than in the lower respiratory tract and does not cause mild or any symptoms in the early stages of infection, similar to other CoVs that can cause a cold.
Therefore, infected patients in the initial stage or retention period can generate a large number of viruses during daily activities, making it very difficult to control the pandemic.
However, when patients are seriously ill, SARS-CoV infection is thought to spread, while most infections do not occur in the early stages.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is more acute than the outbreak of SARS and is difficult to control.
China is currently making massive efforts, including lockdowns in Wuhan and nearby cities and keeping almost the entire population in isolation, to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions are causing significant damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing and the pandemic seems to be decreasing.
The most optimistic forecast is that the outbreak will end by March and the downturn phase will last 3-4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter predicts that COVID-19, which is more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Langini has set up a sample to estimate the impact of the pandemic and suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can infect two-thirds of the global population.
A Canadian group has indicated that SARS-CoV-2 has been found in the mid-turbinate and throttle swab of the patient released by the hospital two weeks ago after recovering from the disease, which shows that the newly identified virus can enter a cyclical chain like influenza.
However, based on the declining number of new cases, there are promising signs from China, which seems to have a positive impact on current policies.
It was initially estimated that Ebola would cause millions of cases and lead to five million deaths.
However, due to severe isolation, the disease was eventually brought under control.
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV, will weaken until it becomes ineffective and eventually disappear or become a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
The comparison between the COVID-19 pandemic with the SARS and MERS pandemic is given below (figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious by coughing or sneezing and can also be caused by direct contact with virus-contaminated materials.
The virus has also been found in the viscera, which has given rise to new chances of infection.
A recent study of 138 cases indicated that 41% of the cases may have been caused by a hospitalised infection, with 17 patients having other pre-existing diseases and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, great care must be taken to protect human beings, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and so on, not only but also third-party people who come in contact with patients or infected people.
The first step of safety to reduce the risk of infection is the use of face masks; surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (Series <0x23>1860s) both help prevent the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent fluid points from infecting individuals in a possible form from reaching the surface of the material from the air, so that their infection does not spread to others.
However, only N95 (series <0x23>1860) masks can stop the respiration of microorganisms from 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of viruses being able to fully penetrate; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and both are about 85 nm in size.
Since particles can also enter through five surgical masks, healthcare providers who have direct contact with patients are required to wear N95 (Series <0x23>1860) without wearing a surgical mask.
Along with masks, healthcare providers are also required to wear fitted isolation gowns to avoid contact with the virus.
Viruses can also infect people through the eyes.
On January 20, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2, despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered their body through their burning eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers must use a transparent face covering or Google when working with patients.
The general public in affected or potential affected areas are advised to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, stay indoors for self-isolation and limit contact with potential infected persons.
Three feet is considered a reasonable distance for people to stay away from a patient.
These actions are considered effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a new virus in the human world, as it was recorded on January 7, 2020, it should have sounded the alarm in China because of the memories of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, even on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Center was telling people that the new virus is less contagious and less reproducing from humans to humans, and it is not difficult to prevent and control the disease at all.
This message greatly reduced the sense of caution among the people, especially when the entire country was preparing for the spring festival and missed a crucial time in Wuhan to contain the disease at a minimum.
China's disease control agencies can learn from these hard lessons and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these institutions should take further precautions while making public announcements (1) because every word spoken by citizens is important and may change their perspectives and decisions; (2) to remain more sensitive and responsive to the unusual information in the clinics at the time of release and to the system in response to the pandemic, without waiting for formal reports from the doctor or nurses; (3) to increase the response to the disease and (3) to increase the public awareness of the disease, and to impose more restrictions to prevent the possible epidemic at the initial stage, rather than to provide relief to the public relief.
The outbreak of COVID-19 was caused by the new virus SARS-CoV-2 that started in late December 2019.
By the time of writing this article, it had spread throughout China and 50 countries around the world.
Since the virus is similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has created a sense of SARS regression.
However, there is a significant difference between COVID-19 and SARS, which is important in controlling the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older men and women more than young people, and has a higher incidence and mortality rate than young people.
The fatality rate of SARS is higher than that of COVID-19 (10.91% vs. 1.44%).
While COVID-19 patients contract the virus even if they do not have symptoms, SARS patients do so only when they are seriously ill, making it much more difficult to prevent the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading faster and more widespread than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA assessment of SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who have recovered can be positive again due to the virus.
These findings have significantly increased the risk of spreading the virus.
These rapid advances in research on COVID-19 have not solved many important issues, such as:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96 percent of genetic homogeneity was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two-bat SARS-like COV, we cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 came from bats.
Which animal was the medium species to infect the virus from the original host, bat or human?
Without knowing the answers to <0x23>1 and <0x23>2, we can't effectively stop the infection and the outbreak can never come back again.
Although molecular modelling and biochemical assessments demonstrated how the virus enters atmospheric cells and then changes the pathogen even if SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2.
Does the virus also bind to ACE-2 expression cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we will not be able to get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the disease last?
How does the virus develop genetically during an infection in humans?
Is it going to be a global pandemic, or will it be a SARS-like extinction or a flu-like outbreak?
The answers to the above and many other questions need to be found, but it may take some time.
No matter what happens, we have no choice but to get rid of the disease as soon as possible and make our lives normal again.
The origins of the human coronavirus
For thousands of years, the co-evolution of coronavirus (CoV) and its host, including humans, has been fueled by mutations and adaptations.
Prior to 2003, two human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were caused by a cold-like disease.
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory disease (SARS) and Middle East respiratory disease (MERS) has shown how devastating and deadly HCoV infection is.
The rise of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 brought the coronavirus back to light, and we were surprised by its high transmissibility, but its pathology was lower than that of its spontaneous SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a zoonotic disease and therefore it is important for us to understand the origins of HCoV's zoonotic disease.
Most HCoVs originate from bats where they are non-infectious.
Some of the HCoV intermediaries are also known to be parasitic.
Identification of animal shelters for the prevention of human diseases can have direct consequences.
Exploring the interaction of COV-poison in animals can shed light on important information on COV pathogens in humans.
In this review, we are presenting a review of the existing information of seven HCoVs, the main focus of which is on their discovery history as well as the origin and transmissibility of their zoonotic disease.
Importantly, we compare different HCoVs from the point of view of virus development and genome recombination.
The current COVID-19 pandemic has been discussed in this context.
In addition, the need to successfully change the host and the impact of the virus' evolution on the severity of the disease has also been highlighted.
Coronavirus (CoV) belongs to a family of coronaviruses, which includes a group of impulsive, positive-sensed, single-stranded RNA viruses.
In these RNA viruses, viruses that shelter the largest genomes of 26 to 32 kilobases are called "CoVs" because they look like crowns under an electron microscope.
Structurally, COVs have unbroken genomes that share the same structure.
About two-thirds of the genome consists of two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted into pp1a and pp1ab replices polyproteins.
Polyproteins are further processed to produce 16 non-structural proteins, ranked NSP1<0x7E>16.
The rest of the genome consists of ORF for structural proteins, including spikes (S), envelops (E), membranes (M) and nucleoproteins (N).
Numerous hereditary-specific auxiliary proteins are also encoded by different genera of COV.
According to the order of different proteins, COVs are classified into four generations (alpha-CoV, island-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV), of which the beta-CoV generation includes the highest number of HCoVs and they are divided into four generations (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence shows that bats and mice serve as genetic sources for most alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while birds are the main hosts for Gamma-CoV and Delta-CoV.
COVs have been continuously crossing species barriers for thousands of years and have emerged as some of the most important human pathogens.
At present, there are seven known human COVs.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Acute Severe Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as colds and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, which produce a severe infection of the lower respiratory tract in relatively more patients who are at higher risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manipulation.
In 1960, the first HCoV-229E pathology, B814, was isolated from the nasal swab of a common cold patient.
Since then, more knowledge was gathered through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 causing self-limiting symptoms.
Thus, there was a widespread perception that the infection caused by HCoV until the outbreak of SARS was generally harmless.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the most devastating outbreaks in current history, infecting more than 8,000 people, with an estimated 10% of the crude case fatalities.
Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak resulted in a continuing epidemic on the Arabian Peninsula that quickly spread to the rest of the world.
The 2019 new HCoV (2019-nCoV) which was later named SARS-CoV-2 was the leading cause of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which had killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm clock is constantly ringing and the world needs to prepare for the impending SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The root of all seven ACOVs is in bats, rats or pets.
Various evidence reinforces the theory of bat originating from bats, in which the virus assimilated the status quo and not pathogenic but showing extraordinary genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.
Tracking the origins of animal disease of the ACOV shows the natural history, mobilization force and the composition of restriction factors leading to the leap of the species.
It will also guide or facilitate the detection of SARS-CoV-2's shelter, intermediate and amplifier parasitic (V) hostess, which will play an important role in preventing its spread in the future.
In this review, we provide a review of the origins of animal disease, interspecies infection, and pathogens of HCoV.
In particular, we focus on the following common theorems and discuss that the parent virus of HCoV is not normally pathogenic in its natural parasite host but becomes pathogenic when interspecies infection occurs in the new host.
We also reviewed the trend of HCoV evolution in which if there is an increase in infectiousness, there is a decrease in pathogenicity.
The impact of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was also discussed in this context.
The animal has known about COV since the late 1930s.
The HCoV-229E pathology B814 was first isolated from different infected animals, including turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven HCoVs have been identified in the last decade.
A brief summary of the findings of HCoV (Table 1) will be informative and informative in order of chronology.
In 1966, the first HCoV-229E pathology was isolated from patients suffering from upper respiratory tract infections, and since then, the WI-38 lung cell line has increased.
HCoV-229E showed symptoms of colds in infected patients, including headaches, shingles, granules and throat sores, as well as fever and cough in 10-20% of cases.
In 1967, the HCoV-OC43 was separated from the small rat organ culture and then from the serial passage in the brain.
The clinical features of the HCoV-OC43 infection were similar to those of the HCoV-229E infection, which is not distinguishable in terms of symptoms from other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread globally and are mainly infected during the winter season in low-temperature environments.
Usually, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than a week after which the disease occurs for about two weeks.
According to a study conducted on human volunteers, HCoV-229E has developed a mild cold in infected healthy individuals.
Only a few weak immune patients have acute respiratory infections.
SARS, called "atypical pneumonia," was the first properly documented universally transmitted HCoV in human history and the etiological factor SARS-CoV, is the third HCoV discovered.
The first case of SARS was reported in late 2002 in China's Guangdong province.
The SARS epidemic has resulted in 8,096 cases, including 774 deaths, which spread to many countries and continents.
Without hyper-spreading, it is estimated that each case can cause approximately two secondary cases, with a warming period of 4 to 7 days, and the top of the virus's effects can appear on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV may initially suffer from muscle pain, headache, fever, pimples and colds, followed by difficulty in breathing, coughing and then breathing.
The most common abnormalities are lymph nodes, broken liver function tests, and increased creatine kinases.
Diffused alveolar damage, elevated cell growth and growth in macrophages have also been found in SARS patients.
Approximately 20-30% of patients will then need an over-the-counter sunscreen and mechanical ventilation.
Along with the lower respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidneys can also become infected with this serious disease, most often with cytokine storms, which can be fatal, especially for patients with weakened immune systems.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a patient's relative who arrived in Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, there has been a lot of research on HKV.
In late 2004, HCoV-NL63 was separated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands.
It was initially found in children, the elderly and patients suffering from respiratory failure.
The disease caused by HCoV-NL63 is common in colds, eyes, fevers and respiratory diseases.
Another independent study described the virus as being isolated from an eight-month-old baby's nose in the Netherlands.
Although found in the Netherlands, it has spread all over the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is responsible for 4.7% of common respiratory diseases and most of its outbreaks occur in summer, spring, and early winter.
HCoV-NL63 is also known as Krupp.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized for pneumonia and respiratory disease in Hong Kong.
HCoV-HKU1, along with community-acquired pneumonia and respiratory disease, is associated with acute asthma.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is also found all over the world, causing mild respiratory diseases.
All four of these community-acquired HCoVs are well-accepted in humans and are less likely to be converted into highly pathogenic diseases, but for unknown reasons, accidents can occur in the same way as they did in the more virogenic subtypes of HCoV-NL63, which have been reported to have caused a severe infection of lower respiratory tract infections in China very recently.
In general, when these HCoVs have the ability to be effectively infected and remain persistent in humans, they also become less toxic or pathogenic.
The MERS-CoV was first isolated in Saudi Arabia in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who had severe pneumonia and kidney problems.
Although most of the confirmed cases originated in the Middle East, the imported cases of secondary transmission were reported in various European countries and Tunisia on the occasion due to close contact.
The second outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The medical signs of MERS are similar to those of SARS, which are manifested by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients suffering from MERS suffered from severe kidney failure, which is very unusual for MERS in diseases caused by HCoV.
The number of patients who had symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting was more than 30%.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed cases were reported, with the death toll at 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses known to mankind.
Between mid-December 2019 and the end of 2019, a group of pneumonia patients began to appear in Wuhan, China's Hubei province, related to a predominant SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a public health emergency of international concern and named the disease COVID-19.
As on March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases were confirmed worldwide, with a crude case fatality rate of 3.4%.
China's Hubei case fatality rate was 4.2%, while China's death rate was 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 is caused by acute respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are caused by fever, cough and respiratory problems.
Hypertension was also observed in some patients.
Pneumonia was one of the most severe symptoms and could lead to an increase in acute respiratory syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high nucleotide sequence homogeneity, they are in different branches in the phylogenetic structure.
SARS-CoV-2 is less pathogenic, but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has reported non-infected patients and may have contributed to its rapid spread around the world.
Comparing SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs shows a great deal of similarity and contrast.
First of all, the boiling period and the duration of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this context, SARS-CoV-2 follows the normal trend of the other six HCoVs.
Secondly, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and four community-based HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
SARS-CoV-2 infection, on the other hand, is characterized by symptoms that occur during a normal HCoV infection, including non-specific, mild or no symptoms.
On the other hand, even in the case of SARS-CoV infection, there is a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19.
Third, the SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by the intricate patterns of both HCoV and SARS-CoV from the community.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2's transmissibility is as high as the HCoV received by the community.
On the other hand, just as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV's cassettes reduce transmission potential in humans, it remains to be verified whether SARS-CoV-2's transmission capacity decreases.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can also be seen in semen samples.
The future study is to see if the septum-oral infection of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, at least in some circumstances, like SARS-CoV.
It will be interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 shows seasonality, just like the cases of HCoV received from the community.
Nevertheless, the features of SARS-CoV-2, including infectiousness, pathogenicity and sustainable transmission among humans, will be effective for the ultimate future of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.
HCoVs from all the four communities that produce mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
From a second perspective, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both may have been saved from the ancient HCoV epidemic.
HCoVs that cause serious diseases in humans and serious HCoVs that are caused by humans should be eradicated.
To make this happen, to the extent that there is sufficient accumulation of favorable mutations, HCoVs should be replicated in humans which will fail the prevention factors of the host.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people it infects, the more likely it is to be fully compatible with humans.
If it is well adapted, it will be difficult to stop its transmission to humans through isolation or other infection control measures.
Over the years, four community-based COVID-19 vaccines have been circulating in humans, causing people with weakened immune systems to get a cold.
These animals do not need shelter.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been properly adapted to humans, and their infection in humans will not be permanent.
They need to be maintained and spread to their animal shelters and spread through one or more intermediary and amplifier shelters as far as possible to reach the vulnerable human target.
The salient features of SARS-CoV-2 are similar in both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four HCoVs from the community.
At the moment, it is highly contagious, just like the HCoV received from the community.
However, it is more pathogenic than the HCoV from the community and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
They will be fully compatible with humans without shelter or intermediary animal shelters and will continue to see if they will spread to humans.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it would be appropriate for you to discuss the definitions and features of HCoVs evolutionary, natural, shelter, intermediary and amplifier.
An animal can become the backbone of the evolution of HCoV if it has sheltered a closely related ancestor who shares a high connotation at the level of nucleotide sequence.
In these conditions, the prognosis of the virus is often optimized and not pathogenic.
Similarly, parasitic poshinda provides shelter to HCoVs continuously and for a long time.
In both cases, the host is naturally infected and is the natural host of the HCoV or its parent virus.
On the contrary, if HCoV is inserted into the intermediate host even before or during its introduction to humans, it does not adapt to the new host and often becomes pathogenic.
These intermediaries can then act as animal shelters for human infection and transcend the role of propagation host by allowing the virus to transiently replicate and then infect humans to expand the scope of human infection.
An HCoV infection can be eliminated if it has not been able to sustain its infection in the intervening host.
On the contrary, HCoVs can accept intermediate doses and not only that, but can establish long-term disease.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural parasite host.
Epidemiological data has revealed that the first case of SARS has a history of contact with predators.
Subsequent seroprevalence investigations showed that the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-IGG was higher among animal traders than in the general population.
Masked palm civets (Paguma larvae) and raccoon dogs were first identified when carrying SARS-CoV-like viruses.
This indirectly reinforced the fact that no more SARS was recorded after killing all the Civics in the market.
However, it was also reported that masked palm civets in the wild or fields that are not in contact with the live animal market were mostly negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that the masked palm civets may be intermediately amplifier, but not a natural shelter for SARS-CoV.
Notably, 80% of the different animals in the Guangzhou market had anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, so the possibility that different species of small mammals also work as intermediate amplifiers for SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out.
All of these appear to be the last vestiges of SARS-CoV.
A subsequent search for the natural habitat of SARS-CoV led to the discovery of a closely related bat COV, called SARS-related Rinolopus bat COV HKU3 (SARS R-RH-BATCOV-HKU3), which exists in the Chinese Horseshoe bat.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genome sequence of SARS-RH-BATCOV-HKU3.
These and other bats share 88-92% nucleotide sequence homogeneity along with SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundation for a new concept that bats feed on the developing human pathogens.
Several SARS-like COVs have been identified from bats, but no one other than WIV1 has been identified as a living virus.
Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is considered a receptor of SARS-CoV.
WIV1 was obtained from a specimen of bats that were demonstrated to be used as receptors for bats, civets and human ACE2 cells.
Interestingly, the blood water of the patient, who had recovered from the disease, was able to neutralize WIV1.
Therefore, WIV1 represents SARS-CoV as the closest relative ancestor of bats that share 95% nucleotide sequence homogeneity.
Although there is high cognition between these two viruses, it is generally understood that WIV1 is not the intermediate parent virus of SARS-CoV, and bats are not the immediate parasitic hosts of SARS-CoV.
Genetic analysis combines MERS-COV into the same group as COV-HKU4 and BAT COV-HKU5.
The bats use COV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV poshinda receptors, dipeptide peptides 4 (DPP4) to enter the virus.
The order of MERS-CoV's RNA-pending RN polymers is historically close to the patterns found in bat beta-CoVs in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in the wild bat.
Only 87% of the nucleotide sequences found in MERS-CoV and the bat COV-HKU25, which are closely related to it.
Thus, bats may not be an immediate parasitic host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies conducted in the Middle East have shown that dromedri camels are seropositive to the MERS-CoV specific neutral antibody, just as the Middle East camels are found in many African countries.
The live MERS-CoV is similar to a virus found in humans that was isolated from the swab of the drummedary camel's nose, further indicating that the camel acts as the parasite Poshinde, a beneficiary of MERS-CoV.
It is interesting to note that generally mild symptoms but a large number of viruses were detected experimentally taking shelter in an infected camel with MERS-CoV.
Notably, infected camels not only shelter the virus through the respiratory tract, but also through the deforestation-directed route, which is also the main way of sheltering the virus from bats.
However, the question remains as to whether many confirmed cases of MERS have no contact history with the camel before symptoms appear, either a human-to-human infection path or an unknown infection path in which unrecognized animal species that shelter MERS-CoV are likely to cause.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide affinity with bat COV RATG13 isolated from rattles associated with rhinolophas.
As is the case with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG 13 is very good at determining the parenting relationship.
This means that bats are likely to not be the immediate parasitic host of SARS-CoV-2 until a similar bat-CoV is detected in the future.
Many of the intermediaries of SARS-CoV-2 must have belonged to the wild animal species that may have been sold and killed at the Hunan Seafood Wholesale Market, with many of the earliest cases related to COVID-19, which are indicative of the possibility of the occurrence of animal-to-human infection.
A number of recent studies based on the metagenome sequence have suggested that a group of small mammals in crisis known as pangolins (Manis Javanika - Khavet Cat) may also be the refuge location of the antecedents of the Beta-CVO related to SARS-CoV-2.
These new pangolins share the CoV genomes 85-92% nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are closely related to RATG13 in parallel with about 90% at the level of nucleotide sequence.
They group SARS-CoV-2-like viruses into two sub-branches in a hereditary tree, one of which shares more similar mortgage domains (RBDs) with SARS-CoV-2, identifying 97.4% amino acid sequences.
In contrast to the absolute truth, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 are more different, although higher levels of genome-wide comparability are higher in order.
Recent research on ailing pangolins has also recorded the presence of a layer of virus on the lung sample, which was found to be similar to SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted a different assembly method and physical curation to create a partial genome sequence of about 86.3% of the full-length virus genome.
You can't exclude the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 being one of the pangolins in the intermediate animal host.
However, there is currently no evidence to support that the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is directly pangolins due to the sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolins SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is also much shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolins SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV.
The path of evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins, and other mammals remains to be established.
While RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolins have the highest order coherence, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 share the highest genome-wide order cognition.
There is widespread speculation that there is a high level of similarity between the RBD of Pangolins SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and the RBD of SARS-CoV-2, which is a selectively developed drug.
There is an alternative proposal in the benefit of recombination between the respective Beta-CoV and RATG13 of the third wild animal species Pangolins SARS-CoV-2.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is widespread in beta-CoV.
The jurors are still searching for the immediate animal origin of SARS-CoV-2.
Animal origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied, even while high levels of pathogenic HCoV.
Genetic evidence has shown that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E are derived from bats' COVs, while HCoV-OC433 HCoV-HKU1's parent virus has been found in rats.
It has been reported that the COV of the bat was found in the ARCov.2 (Appalachian Ridge COV) North American triangular bat, showing a close association with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is chromosomatically related to another bat's COV, named as Hippoderos/Ghanaquam/19/2008, which was found in Ghana, at the same time the camels were suspected to be their intermediary hosts.
For clarity, the present knowledge of animal origin of HCoV known in Figure 1 and Table 2 is summarized.
Evidence of the interspecies transmission of HCoV in history has been presented through a hereditary analysis.
When HCoV-OC43 from domestic livestock crossed the species to infect humans around 1890, the association with respiratory infections was recorded.
The history of HCoV-229E infection is very brief.
Alpha-CoV has been found to be closely related to HCoV-229E.
One of them is Alpha-CoV.
There is evidence of several levels of support for the direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, humans are likely to have come into contact with bats in a shared environment, not alpacas.
Instead, they are more closely related to humans.
Secondly, HCoV-229E-related bats are isolated and non-infectious in alpha-CoV bats, while alpacas alpha-CoV has been the cause of the outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Alpacas Alpha-CoV has not been found in the wild.
Thus, the possibility that alpacas received HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans cannot be excluded.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including the rabies virus, the Ebola virus, the Nipah virus and the Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, bat alpha-CoV is the genetic stock of HCoV-229E, with alpacas and drummerry camels acting as intermediaries that can transmit the virus to humans, as happened in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV has served as the best example of interspecies transmission from bats to dromadri camels and from dromadri camels to humans.
The origin of the evolution of Mers-CoV from bats is known for its early identification and has also been reinforced by subsequent discoveries.
It is apparent that bats provide a rich stock of virus species for interspecies exchange of infection between genetic fragments and interspecies.
All the ideal conditions of long life, a colony full of datiwati, close social interaction and the ability to fly have made the bats ideal as a microbial broadcaster.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has entered the Dromedri camel for decades.
These camels have embraced them well which has made them a stable and natural parasitic host from the intermediate host.
MERS-CoV causes a very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Their small number of human infections is an accident, and humans live in a phased shelter of MERS-CoV because its infection is not sustainable.
The role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, in the complication of SARS-CoV-2, is, if any, different in contrast to the role of pangolins.
In particular, pangolins beta-CoV is highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They can be step-by-step hosts for SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, as in SARS-CoV cases.
Future research should consider or deny the myriad possibilities of SARS-CoV-2 infection from animals to humans.
First, bats can be the parasitic host of SARS-CoV-2 related viruses, which are almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share the environment with bats by slaughtering them or through coal mines.
Secondly, pangolins, it may be one of the intermediate amplifiers that have recently been identified with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Human contact with the virus is caused by slaughter and hunting.
It is possible that many mammals, including pets, are sensitive to SARS-CoV-2.
It is necessary to conduct animal and animal surveys.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and acceptance of SARS-CoV-2 can be found in third species that are in contact with bats and pangolins.
The origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still being investigated.
Apart from different animal shelters, three main aspects are also important in favor of the COVID virus in facilitating the crossing of another species barrier.
First, they have a relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-leaf RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of COV depends on the stage of acceptance of COV with a new host, with the average replacement rate being "negative" to "high" when with a -10-4 replacement per 2 sites per year.
COV has an evidence-read exorribonuclease, which removal would have an effect in crossing high-level mutations and in mitigation or even in viability.
Surprisingly, nucleotide analogy remdesivir is known to inhibit this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymers to replicate COV.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising agents against SARS-CoV-2 being tested in clinical trials.
Nevertheless, the mutation rate of COV is about a million times higher than the rate of their parentheses.
Moreover, when COVs are not well accepted by the host, the mutation rate is always high.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is clearly low, indicating a high level of acceptance to humans.
It may have already been accepted by other approaches close to human beings.
It is also applicable to MERS-CoV as an addition to SARS-CoV-2, which is well accepted by Dronedrie Uttani.
Theoretically, it is impossible to say that the genetic dispersion will make the ineffective against SARS-CoV-2 immunizations and conditions-viral in a rapid manner.
Secondly, the large RNA genomes in COVs tend to attract additional flexibility in GNOME correction for mutations and recombination, which increases the likelihood of interspecies co-evolution, which is beneficial for the emergence of Novel COVs when the situation becomes even.
This is supported by many other open readable frames and by the protein action encoded at the end of the genome to 3'.
Third, COVs switch templates between RNA replicas randomly and frequently through other such "copy-selected" mechanisms.
They act as a mixing vessel in the nodes, a string switching occurs frequently during the transcription of COV RNA.
High levels of comprehensible full length and sub-genomic RNA can be recombined to create new COVs.
Hereditary evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 as well as animal COVs such as bat SL-CoV and bat COV-HKU9.
Interaction between viruses and viruses in relation to infection
In addition to the three virus aspects mentioned above, the viral interaction with the host recipient is another important factor that is influential in interspecies infections.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a sample example, which has also shown evidence of positive selection during interspecies transition events.
Based on a comparative analysis of the segregation between humans and Sivate SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV seems to have been quickly adopted in different contexts, especially with mutations at the RBD of S proteins.
In general, in RBD in S proteins, COV interacts with a cell recipient and is selected by a repulsive response to the host with passion.
In SARS-CoV, RBDs are on the S1 continent in the 318th to 510th Amino Amla, which binds human ACE2 as well as their recipients to the virus entry.
The RBD of SARS-CoV allows ACE2 recipients of various animals, including bats, ducks, rats and raccoons, to transmit the interspecies of viruses capable of detecting them.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were found to be different in the RBD between the human and the civet virus segregation, and 4 of them are located in the recipient-mortgage image for interaction with the ACE2 recipient.
The K489N and S487T mutations in the Civate SARS-CoV are in their RBDs, which can reinforce the desire for the interaction of spike proteins with human ACE2 recipients.
In other words, the replacement of these two amino acids may be important in virus acceptance for humans.
It is important to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell recipient with SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 ace of S proteins indicates that the mortgage desire with human ACE2 of their S protein may have changed.
Of course, a cryo-EM study has shown that the desire for these hostages is 10- to 20-foot higher than the mortgage between human ACE2 and SARS-CoVS proteins.
It will also be of interest to determine if any other co-applicant is required for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
HCoV-NL63 may also be associated with ACE2, but with a different part of S.
There are a number of other HCoV receptors, such as amino peptides N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for successfully accepting these COVs in humans after an interspecies infection from their animal nutrients.
As an addition to cell receptors, the effect of an interspecies infection of HCoV is also controlled by other nutrient dependence and preventive factors.
The degradation of this nutrient protein between the natural accumulated nutrients of HCoVs such as humans and bats, dromadrie camels and rodents can lead to interspecies transmission.
HCoV is a successful inter-species infection that requires the strengthening of the nutritional dependence factors and the elimination of the nutrient resistance factors.
In this context, the molecular determinants are yet to be identified and their characteristics determined in part of this important virus-prone interaction.
Using the state-of-the-art technology of CRISPR for SARS-CoV-2, a non-prejudicial scrutiny of the genome-wide and inhibitory components of nutritional dependence can be helpful.
The emergence of a new HCoV: going back to zero
The diversity of bat COVs provides a lot of opportunities for the emergence of new HCOVs.
Thus, bat-whaled COV is used as a genetic stock of HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombination also trigger HCoV evolution and serve as two important stages in the process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes has the potential to radically alter the viral visualization.
In SARS-CoV-assisted proteins, ORF8 is considered important to be accepted in humans, as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses are found to encode orf8 proteins while isolated.
In the early stages of the disease, the SARS-CoV 29-Nucleotide deletion feature has been found.
Because of this deletion, ORF8 is divided into ORF8a and ORAP8B and is considered an acceptable mutation, which promotes the migration of nutrients.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombination with the lineage of alpha- and gamma-CoV, with a large number of smaller recombinant parts found in RNA.
Recombination locations were also identified in NSP9, mostly in NSP10, and in parts of NSP14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the synapse MERS-CoV has experienced recombination events in different lineages, which have been found in dromedri camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been reported in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs are recombinated into their non-structural genes along with other animal COVs.
An artificial selection may also contribute to the unwanted change of the virus genome, which often relieves the selective pressure of the virus from being used by the immune system of the host.
HCoV-229E is an example of this resulting in the loss of full-length ORF4 in the prototype genome and the removal of two-nucleotides.
The Union ORF4 can be found in bats and camel viruses associated with HCOC-229E, the Alpaca alpha-CoV denotes single nucleotide inclusion, which is affected in the frameshift.
Last but not the last, the evolution of new HCoVs is also made possible by the pressure of choice in their parasitic positions.
Alkaline or only mild symptoms were found when bats were infected with COV, which indicates mutual acceptance between COV and bats.
It appears that the bats accepted the COV both physically and physically well.
For example, the defect in the activation of a pre-treatment response to a bat reduces the efficacy of a pathologist implemented by COV.
In addition, the normal cell activity of bats is suppressed due to the upgradation of the receptor NKG2/CD94 and the low concentration of the main cytoplasmic composite class I molecules.
In addition, both the high levels of reactive oxygen type (ROS) generated from high-calorie action of bats press the COV replication action and affect the prophrindigy through exoribonuclease, thus providing the origin of the lineage of the virus to a large number of pathogens.
More pathogenic COV lineages also evolved in recombination, leading to the acquisition of new protein or protein characteristics to adapt to nutrients.
Thus, these three new HCoVs have not arisen by mistake in the last two decades.
COVs are caused by non-communicable or mild symptoms in their host hosts such as bats or camels.
They produce impeccable replicas without removing a strong supportive immune response.
Here, the mystery of why the asymptomatic vessels appeared and what is causing the serious problem in human infection is hidden.
The severe symptoms are mainly due to the high activation of the immune response and the cytokine storm, whereas where the immune response is more potent, there appears to be more acute form of lung damage.
On the contrary, in the alkyl carriers, the immune response from replication of COV is deduced.
The same anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatment can be a beneficial strategy to break down the immune response.
Interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, the management of at least type-I interferon should be beneficial in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, NLRP3 inhibitory activation in bats is faulty.
For this reason, the MCC950 co-applicant of NLRP3 inhibitor can be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows a common practice, through which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV arise.
In contrast, 95% of the nucleotide homogeneity in bat beta-CoV was found to be shared with SARS-CoV, while 96% of nucleotide homogeneity in bat-CoV also exists with SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the fact that marketers and other animals have been found to be sheltering viruses such as SARS-CoV, there was no immediate intermediary support for SARS-CoV-2.
The asymmetry of SARS-CoV-2 in the Pangolins Beta-CoV has been astonishingly found, indicating that the Pangolins may have been acting as one of the intermediary hosts or that the Pangolins Beta-CoV may have contributed to genetic fragmentation in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
The question remains, however, that there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is either consciously or accidentally man-made.
Due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, COVs have once again become popular.
Studies in bats and other animals have radically changed our understanding of the importance of HCoV's parasitic habitat in animal origin and human infections.
Evidence of the spread has shown that the bat is the origin of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and that its transmission to humans took place through intermediaries.
SARS-CoV infection originated from contact with humans and the Ud cat market, effectively ending the SARS-CoV epidemic by closing the seafood market and killing the Ud cat there.
For the same reason, pangolins should also be removed from the seafood market to prevent animal infections, given the discovery that the multi-ethnic lineage of pangolins beta-CoV is closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, future exploration remains to clarify whether and how humans contracted SARS-CoV-2 from pangolins and other mammals.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has existed in the Dromedri camel for a long time.
It is an important mode of transport and has been a major source of meat, milk, skins and wool products for the local people.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
As has been done in China's wildlife market to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels for the control of MERS.
To prevent the re-occurring outbreak of MERS, the gross approach to developing an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for camels should be undertaken with the integration of other infection control measures.
Because we can't eliminate these viruses, a new obsessive type can arise to cause an outbreak.
In the wild animals, different types of animal species are also roaming the cove.
In particular, bat COVs are also very diverse, along with animal potential.
There are numerous opportunities for evolution and recombination in these animal COVs, which will result in the emergence of a new COV in a more transmissible and/or life-threatening form in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals should be abandoned in some places in China to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the order of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a good preparedness and response plan should be prepared.
In fact, many viruses have existed on this planet for a long time.
They stay in their natural habitat until they have the opportunity to expand.
Although bats have many characteristics of spreading the virus, training people to stay away from bats and other wildlife species can reduce human contact with them.
To better understand the life cycle of COVs and their natural hosts, there is a need to continuously monitor mammals, which can be useful in preventing human infection from animals and future outbreaks.
To put an end to this, avoiding human beings from the circumstantial location of the natural habitat of the zoonotic virus is the most effective way to prevent the zoonotic virus.
Numerous pieces of the code of animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
For the first time, if a bat infects the antecedent virus of SARS-CoV-2 in pangolins, it will be interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins share the same ecological location.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human infection, humans will have to determine how they got in contact with the bat.
Third, if the third mammals actually acted as intermediaries, it should be clear how they interacted with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Finally, many mammals, including pets, should be monitored and tested for SARS-CoV-2 as a possibility of being sensitive.
If it's bats, pangolins, or other mammals, they'll be able to detect the same SARS-CoV-2 or their ancestor virus in their natural habitats in the future.
Continuous exploration in this area will explain the evolution path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, the important interplay in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
The diagnostic criteria for the "suspected case" and "confirmed case" of COVID-19 need to be updated.
On February 6, 2020, our team published quick advice guidelines for molecular treatment for the diagnosis of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, and these guidance principles have made a good reference to our fight against the pandemic and around the world.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease. Our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the experience of research and clinical practice currently underway, so, the strategy of diagnosis and treatment is also constantly updated.
In this letter, a comment on our guideline has been made and the latest diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 (Seventh Edition) "Suspected Cases" and "confirmed Cases" are provided by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China, according to the latest diagnosis and treatment.
The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in December 2019 was officially called the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was named the Severe Acute Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO designated COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat the infection of SARS-CoV-2, our team has developed quick advice guidelines and they have been published online in Military Medical Resurgence on February 06, 2020.
It has received a lot of attention since it was published.
Note that even though COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness-raising knowledge is gradually increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practice; so the diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), published a total of seven periodicals of diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 between 16th January 2020 and 3rd March 2020 with some reference in a systematic manner.
Now our guidelines have received comments from Zhou et al., they have submitted a simple qualitative proposal based on their clinical experience.
His work has added new evidence to our guidelines and has also made a valuable reference to this pandemic around the world.
We appreciate your hard work and thank you for your support.
However, his work also needs to be updated in accordance with COVID-19 (Test Seventh Edition) and the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines of recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), confirmation of suspected cases requires that any single item of epilepsy history feature needs to be combined with two items of therapeutic invention, or if there is no clear epidemiological history, the three items of therapeutic invention must be completed.
Epidemiological history: (1) the history of travel or residence in the Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or 14 days before symptoms appear, in the area of contact with cases such as cases of COVID-19, in the area of contact within the first 2 weeks of contact with the patient's home; (2) the history of contact with cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the area of contact (including the beginning of the previous 14 days of contact with the patient's, or the surrounding area).
Clinical inventions: (1) symptoms of fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) accompanied by a characteristic characteristic of COVID-19 infection; (3) the total number of white cells decreased in the initial stage, or the number of lymphocytes decreased.
Diagnosing confirmed cases should be on the basis of suspected cases involving any one of the components of pathological or serological evidence as further indicated: (1) the real-time PCR test should be positive for IRS-CoG-CoV-2 in the acute stage of the SARS-CoV-2 mutation; (2) for the known novel coronavirus and the entire genetic sequence of the virus that exhibits high homogeneity to the SARS-CoV-2 in the serum test.
We can see that the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in the respiratory tract or blood sample was added to the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) frequencies
The pathological identification of blood samples was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020); and later in the seventh edition serological evidence was added.
These improvements are based on the routine work of researchers, including the introduction of blood samples from the respiratory tract, to identify the optimal nucleic acid for this rapid diagnosis, who have increased the availability of different samples, and have supported bringing positive results to a specific antibody in confirmed criteria.
Apart from that, there was more and more evidence that reminded us to be careful with the symptomatic and symptomatic patient.
Therefore, the flowchart of Zhou et al. should be updated, as they are categorizing a person without clinical symptoms as a "low risk."
There is also a need to verify the quality system in further clinical practice and study.
To conclude, we hope that more direct evidence will come to the readers to give their comments.
For the diagnosis of “suspected case” and “confirmed case”, we must follow and comply with the latest guidelines of his/her country of origin.
Our team will also update our guidelines from time to time to provide assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, highest in a single day
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 in a single day.
This is the highest number of daily deaths due to the virus.
As of yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases.
A total of 17 deaths have been reported.
In an online brief, Dr. Mirzade Sabrina Flora, director of the IEDCR, said the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Mirzade, the two cases were between the ages of 60, two between 51 and 60, and one between the ages of 41 and 50.
He also said that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
Hospital officials told a local news outlet, Adolu Agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at the Friendship Hospital in Kuwait.
In an online video announcement on Saturday, Bangladeshi Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader said public transport will remain closed until Saturday, for more than initially planned.
The public transport shutdown was scheduled to begin on March 26 and end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of essential commodities - medical, fuel and ann - is still allowed.
The first case of COVID-19 infection was reported in Bangladesh on March 8, which included two people returning from Italy and the wife of one of them.
On the 19th of March, all three of them had already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 crosses one million infections worldwide
On Thursday, Johns Hopkins University data showed that the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection worldwide exceeded one million.
At least 52,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
The milestone came the same day Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and Zambia confirmed their coronavirus-related death.
North Korea on Thursday claimed that it was one of the few countries free of the coronavirus.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization confirmed 1,051,635 cases, including 79,332 cases in the previous 24 hours, at 10.00 a.m. of Central European Time (8800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 coronavirus cases have been reported, of which 5,900 have been linked to deaths.
CBS News, quoting data from Johns Hopkins University, reported that more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S. were due to the coronavirus infection on Wednesday.
All over the world, strict measures have been taken to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, postponed the lockdown until May 1.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced that he will continue to work until April 30.
Portugal's parliament extended the state of national and emergency by 15 days, with resolution 215 passed, ten absentee ballots, and one vote against it.
Saudi Arabia has imposed a full day curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina: Previously, the curfew was only from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand has decided to impose a curfew from 10 pm to 4 am.
The governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, has extended his stay at home order until May 1.
In Australia, stores have reduced the limit of toilet paper per transaction.
The ban on the purchase of its toilet paper by the Australian store chain Woolworths and Coles reduced the two-way and one package per transaction to a national level, respectively.
Aldi also launched a one-pack limit on Monday.
These limits are posted as messages on checkout and on the chain's Facebook page.
If people need to self-isolate, the buyers are stocking up again due to the fear of COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited each purchase to one pack per order for home delivery.
These changes have come after the four-pack ban on previous transactions submitted by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5.
Coles, in his March 8 disclosure, reported that there would be a four-pack ban, "many stores are selling within an hour of delivery," and said the demand was "unbelievable," while ALDI, on its Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unexpected."
According to a Woolworths spokesperson, sales "increased significantly" in the past week.
The costco's store in Canberra also limited the number of packs to two last week.
To further reduce the deficit, Coles ordered a larger package from suppliers and increased the delivery frequency. Wolworths ordered additional stock, while ALDI made early availability for the scheduled Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailer Association, said that the retailer tried to increase the stock, but it was difficult because of the local council's truck-supply time restrictions.
They expect an increase in production costs, as the suppliers have to meet the demand, and to a lesser extent the special.
On Tuesday, ADLI announced that due to the early shipment of stocks, some stores could not run Wednesday specials.
In the News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retailer expert at the University of Queensland of Technology said that stores are filling up stocks every night.
Shera Marla said toilet paper is a large item, which leads to a low amount of stock in numbers, and, when sold, blanks out a large amount of shelf space.
The Coles and Woolworths scene showed [ki] that if there were numerous objects on the self, such as toilet rolls and sanitizers, and there were more, you would reduce the likelihood of panic, said Russell Zimmerman, according to ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said that his stock has expired.
According to a report by News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures the Kleenex Toilet Tissue, and the Solaris Paper that produces Sorbent, stressed that they are working 24/7 to keep the supply smooth.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property sellers in Melbourne are offering free toilet paper to the first bidder at its auction, when some auctions were held due to the buyers having time during the large weekend of Labor Day.
In Thursday's edition of NT News, eight water inserts were added to Darwin's daily printed, cut and used as toilet paper.
According to ABC Australia's March 3 report, the store was originally against the imposition of restrictions, in which they stated that they had no plans to impose any restrictions on the purchase.
Russel Zimmerman said that there is also a huge demand for other products which include masks, sanitizers, dry goods, handwashes and flour.
Similarly, outside of Australia, on Sunday evening, the British online supermarket Ocado restricted the purchase of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12-rollers.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Although the term "global accompanying" is related to just how dangerous a disease is, the WHO has stated that there is a need to take concrete action by governments.
All countries can still change the pace of this global pandemic
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: "In response, nations have identified, tested, treated, quarantined, tracked, and mobilized their people in the fight.
We are deeply concerned about both the spread of dangerous and serious inactions at the alarming level.
According to Dr. Tom Friedan, former head of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this is "unprecedented" globally.
In comments published in CNN in February, he said, "Without influenza, no other respiratory-related virus has been traced back from the emergence of the virus to the global spread."
"We've never seen a global pandemic caused by the coronavirus before," he said.
He added: "We haven't seen a world that can be controlled at the same time.
The current global pandemic is a follow-up to the WHO's decision to declare the outbreak a global public health emergency in January.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the United States' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak, "It is certain that this situation is going to get worse."
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus is a global pandemic of COVID-19 and is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes severe respiratory abnormalities.
The outbreak was detected in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and was declared a public health emergency of global concern on January 30, 2020, and has become known as a global pandemic since March 11, 2020.
Nearly 1.61 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories of COVID-19 on April 10, 2020, resulting in nearly 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 3,64,000 people have recovered.
China has a mortality rate of 4%, with the world in the range of 13.04% to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and sore throat.
Symptoms of pneumonia and acute respiratory distress can be found in cases of complications.
The time from infection to symptoms appear is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
No vaccine or specific antiviral treatment is known.
The first treatment is to treat symptoms and underlying symptoms. The recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth while coughing, maintaining distance from other people, monitoring and self-isolation of individuals who are suspected to be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by restricting travel, quarantine, constricting, controlling workplace hazards and shutting down services.
This global partnership has led to severe socio-economic disruptions globally. Sports, religious, political and cultural events have been postponed or cancelled, and there has been a massive shortage of supply items and it has been devastated by panic buying.
Schools and universities in 193 countries are either nationally or locally closed, and this has affected nearly 99.4% of the global student population.
False information about the virus has spread online and there have been incidents of fear or hatred and discrimination against the Chinese people, other East and Southeast Asians, and people in areas with significant cases of similar and similar viruses.
The reduction in travel and closure of heavy industries has reduced air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health officials in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported cases of pneumonia caused by unknown causes on December 31, 2019, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were related to the wholesale market of seafood in Hunan, and therefore the origin of the virus is believed to be zoonotic.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that has a close association with the coronavirus of bats, the coronavirus associated with rats, and SARS-CoV. A very early-onset person with symptoms was later diagnosed with the disease on 1 December 2019 and had no direct contact with the later weight market group.
Two-thirds of the early cases reported in 2019 were found to be related to the market.
The unconfirmed report of the South China Morning Post on 13 March 2020 suggested that the first case of a 55-year-old man in Hubei province, which was tracked until 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that as the registration of new cases in China decreased but suddenly increased in Italy and South Korea, the number of new cases outside of China increased for the first time.
Cases may have been reported in a much smaller form, especially in cases where mild symptoms have been reported.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases were reported among young people, with cases aged 19 or under accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. According to Patrick Vallance, the chief medical adviser to the United Kingdom, 60% of the British population must be infected before receiving mass immunization.
The cases are related to the number of people tested for COVID-19 and those who have tested positive as per the official rules.
As of March 23, no countries had tested more than 3% of their population, and official policies of many countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland were such that those with mild symptoms should not be tested.
According to a study published on March 16, about 86% of those infected with COVID-19 in China as of January 23 had not been found, and the unwritten ones were the source of infection of 79% of the cases.
In a statistical analysis published on March 30, it was estimated that the number of infections in Italy was significantly higher than the reported cases.
The primary estimate of the basic reproduction number (R0) about COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
According to a study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it could be 5.7.
Most of the people who have COVID-19 have recovered.
And in those who do not, the duration from symptoms to death is 6 to 41 days, most commonly 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, nearly 97,000 people have died due to COVID-19.
As of February 5, 80% of the deaths in China were people over 60, and 75% had diseases involving heart disease and diabetes with pre-existing health problems. Official figures of deaths caused by the COVID-19 pandemic usually relate to those who tested positive for COVID-19 as per official rules.
In fact, death due to COVID-19 can be much higher, as it may not include those who were not tested, for example, at home, in the bathrooms, etc.
Little data from Italy shows that the number of deaths during the global pandemic was 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death rate.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that "we know that [the number of deaths reported] is a low-lying estimate", a statement that confirms incomplete reports of a decline in the count in the U.S. on January 9, 2020. Such a low-counting of deaths often occurs in the pandemic, as was the case with the first H1N1 swine flu of 2009.
The first death outside the mainland of China occurred in the Philippines on February 1, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
As of February 28, outside China's mainland, more than a dozen deaths were reported each in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
Deaths were reported in more than forty countries and territories as of March 13 in all continents except Antarctica. A number of methods are commonly used to record the number of deaths.
These figures vary by region and time, and the number of tests carried out, the status of the healthcare system, treatment options, the time since the outbreak, and the characteristics of the population; for example, age, sex, and overall health are affected. The ratio of deaths to deaths in a given period of time shows the proportion of cases that have been diagnosed.
According to data from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 10, 2020, the ratio of deaths and cases worldwide is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
This number varies by region.
The ratio of deaths in China with cases decreased from 17.3% (in respect of symptoms in 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (in respect of symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other methods include Case Fatality Rate (CFR), which shows the percentage of people infected (diagnosised and untreated) who died from the disease.
These figures do not have a time limit and track a particular population from infection to the resolution of the case.
Many educational institutions have tried to account for these figures for certain populations.
Based on evidence from the University of Oxford, the Center for Medical Sciences estimates that the overall death rate from the global pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper-hand forecast in this category is consistent with the first randomized testing of COVID-19 in Germany and with a statistical study that analyses the impact of the tests on CFR.
The WHO is confident that this can be brought under global control.
The highest level and maximum duration of this outbreak are uncertain and may vary by location.
Macy's Bonnie, from Penn State University, states, "If not examined, the outbreak of the infection ceases to rise to one level, and it decreases when the host of the disease is available."
It is impossible to predict when this will happen."
Zhong Nanshan, a senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, has argued that if all countries begin to follow the WHO's advice on measures to prevent the spread of the virus, "it will end by June".
On March 17, Adam Kuchersky of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV2 "is likely to spread for one to two years."
According to a study led by Neil Ferguson of Imperial College, maintaining physical distance and other measures "will be required (likely to take 18 months or longer) until the vaccine is available."
William Shafner of Wonderbilt University stated that "it is impossible to completely eradicate the virus because it is so easily infected", so "it will become seasonal disease and most likely return every year."
The toxicity or intensity of return depends on the extent of collective immunity and change.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are not comparable and do not appear in people who have been infected.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Low-resistance symptoms include fatigue, buildup of respiratory tract (cough), lack of sense of smell, drowsiness, drowsiness, nausea and joint pain, coughing, headaches, colds, vomiting, vomiting, bleeding, diarrhea or shortness of breath. The WHO recommends that one of the most severe symptoms is skin bluening.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has listed emergency symptoms; for example, respiratory distress, long-term chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, trouble getting up and having a face or lip blue; if such symptoms occur, it is advisable to seek immediate medical treatment. If the disease increases further, it can lead to acute pneumonia, acute symptoms of respiratory distress, swelling of the respiratory tract, and death of the cept.
Since some of the infected people may not have symptoms, no medical symptoms, but the results of the tests will ensure infection, the researchers have advised that those who have come in close contact with those who are sure of the infection should be closely monitored and examined to rule out the possibility of infection.
The Chinese estimate that the proportion of people who do not have symptoms may be slightly as high as 44%.
The actual onset of the disease is usually one to 14 days after the virus enters the body, usually five days. The number of people who have lost sense of smell among people with COVID-19 as an example of uncertainty was initially 30% and then it is estimated to have dropped to 15%.
Some details on how the disease spreads are still being investigated.
The disease is mainly thought to be spread when the contact is within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet) due to the small drop caused by close contact and coughing, sneezing or speaking.
During the study, it was found that the droplets can travel from 4.5 m (15 ft) to 8.2 m (27 ft) due to non-face coverings.
Some have speculated that small droplets that come out of the mouth can also be infected by small droplets that can stay in the air for a long time. Although the virus is not produced in the air, droplets in the respiratory tract can be prepared to breathe.
These droplets can go into the mouth or nose of people nearby or be dragged into the lungs with breathing.
Medical procedures, such as intubation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, can cause the secretion of the respiratory tract to spread through the air.
If someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches his eyes, nose, or mouth, it can spread.
Although it is believed that it can spread through the hive, it is believed that it is less risky.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through the cervix or oral. Although there is a possibility of symptoms before and during the next stage of the disease, the virus is most likely to spread within the first three days after symptoms appear.
Three days before the symptoms appear, people have tested positive and this indicates that it is possible to get infected even before the symptoms appear at large.
There are only a few reports of non-symptoms but confirmed cases in the lab, but some countries have detected an infection even when they do not show symptoms.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control states that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person infects two to three other individuals. The virus survives on the surface for a few hours.
In particular, the virus is found on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for up to three days, a day on cardboard and up to four hours on copper.
However, it can vary depending on humidity and temperature. COVID-19 tests of pets and other animals have been positive.
Although British authorities advise hand washing after contact with other surfaces such as the surface with which infected persons are likely to be touched, there is no evidence that animals can infect humans.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an unprecedented virus that was first isolated from three individuals with pneumonia associated with a group of cases of acute respiratory illness in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of Novel SARS-CoV-2 are found in all related coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies due to the domestic soap dissolving its protective shield. SARS-CoV-2 is basically closely related to SARS-CoV.
It is believed to be of animal origin.
Genetic analysis has revealed that the corona virus forms a genetic group with genes that are derived from two bats with the subgenus Serbic virus (Line Edge B) along with the betacoronavirus.
Its entire genome level is 96% compatible with other bat-like coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one amino acid difference between the genome sequences in the genome sequences of man-made viruses.
To date, 92% of the content of the genome content shared between the genome virus and SARS-CoV-2 has been discovered in comparison to the entire genome, which is insufficient to prove that the genome is the only intermediary host.
The virus can be detected temporarily based on symptoms, but it is confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) or CT imaging.
A comparative study of PCR and CT conducted in Wuhan suggests that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less accurate, and many of its imaging features are comparable to other pneumonia and disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that CT should not be used or used as a first test to diagnose COVID-19.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a number of RNA testing rules for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was issued on January 17.
This test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR).
This test can be done on a respirator or on a blood sample.
Results can be available within a few hours.
Usually, this test is carried out with a sample of the secretion of the upper part of the nose, but a sample of the secretion of the throat can also be used. Many labs and companies are developing blood-resistant tests.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these tests were sufficiently proven to be approved for widespread use.
In the U.S., a blood test developed by Selex has only been approved for use by certified laboratories.
Specific image features on radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people who do not have symptoms include unprocessed peripheral ground glass opacity and do not have pliaryal effusion.
International online information on the detection of imaging of confirmed cases is being compiled by the Italian Radiological Society.
It is less accurate to use imagery in detecting COVID-19 without confirmation of the PCR due to the fact that it combines with an infection such as adenovirus.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and showed that although imaging is less accurate to detect infection, it is faster and more sensitive and suggested that it should be considered as a means of detection in areas spread by the pandemic.
Convolutional neural networks with radiographs and CT based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect the image features of the virus.
Plans to prevent infection include maintaining your overall personal health, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth, using tissues while coughing or sneezing, and putting tissue directly in the trash.
Those who have already been infected have been advised to wear a surgical mask in public places.
Measures have also been recommended for maintaining physical distancing to prevent infection. Many governments have restricted or advised not to travel to other parts from areas where the outbreak has occurred.
However, the virus has reached the level of social dissemination in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus has spread to the society and some sections of the society do not know when and where they got the infection. People who are providing health care are recommended to take care of an infected person by standard, contact and eye care. Tracking people who come in contact is an important method for health officials to detect the origin of the infection and prevent further infections.
The use of mobile phones by governments for this purpose has raised concerns about private life and a statement has been issued by Amnesty International and 100 other organisations regarding the restriction on such surveillance.
Several mobile apps have been implemented or suggested for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, a group of more than a dozen experts were working on options such as using Bluetooth to log in with other cellphones, a close-up of a user holding private life.
Then comes a message to users if they come in close contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misunderstandings about preventing infection are spreading, for example, cleaning and mowing the nose are not effective.
There is no vaccine available for COVID-19, many organizations are trying to develop the vaccine.
It is recommended to wash your hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands appear to be dirty to the eyes, wash their hands before eating and after rinsing their noses, coughing or sneezing.
The reason for this is that the virus outside the human body dies from home soap because the home soap bursts its guardian valve.
If water and soap are not available, the CDC still recommends that alcohol-based hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol should be used in proportion.
The WHO recommends not touching the eyes, nose, or mouth without washing hands.
Many solutions such as 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hydrochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2-7.5% povidone-iodine can eliminate surface contamination (the surface of stainless steel can be disinfected using only one minute disinfectant).
Other solvents such as benzalconium and crohexidine are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if there is a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 in a place such as a cafeteria or a sanatorium, all tablets, touch screens, remote control and ATM machines used by sick persons in such areas should be disinfected.
Health organizations have recommended that people cover their mouth and nose with a folded elbow or tissue while coughing or sneezing and dispose of the tissue immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who are likely to be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the amount and distance of travel between the droplets that are spread by breathing when speaking, sneezing or coughing.
The WHO has given instructions on how and when to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virus scientist at the University of Leeds, wearing a mask is likely to reduce people's tendency to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection if the hand is not healthy."
The WHO recommends wearing masks only if healthy people are at risk, for example those who are taking care of people who have been infected with COVID-19, agreeing that wearing a mask can help people avoid touching their faces.
Many countries have started encouraging people to wear masks.
The CDC recommends the use of non-medical masks made of cloth in the U.S. The CDC recommends the use of disposable medical masks, especially in public health care providers, especially when coming in close contact with other people (1 m (3 ft) or less.
Hong Kong has recommended the use of surgical masks while using public transport or in crowded places.
Thailand's health authorities are encouraging people to make cloth masks for the face at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from wearing face masks in public or from going out without covering their noses and mouths.
On March 16, Vietnam urged everyone to wear a mask in public to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory to wear a face mask while going to a grocery store.
The Israeli government has asked all residents to wear face masks in public.
Since mid-March, Taiwan has been producing 10 million masks daily, making it mandatory for passengers to wear face masks on trains and intercity buses from April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a face mask while going out and recommended that those who are not able to buy face masks should wear masks at home.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Maintaining social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves actions to control infection which are aimed at minimizing the spread of the disease by reducing close contact between individuals.
The methods include isolation, restrictions on travel and closure of schools, workplaces, grounds, theatres or shopping centres.
People can implement this method of social distancing by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded places, not touching while greeting, and keeping physical distance from others.
Many governments have ordered or recommended social distancing in areas where outbreaks have occurred.
U.S. government agencies and health departments cut the maximum number of people gathering from 250 people (if the spread of COVID-19 is not known in that province) to 50 people and then to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany has banned gatherings of more than two people in public places. Adults in places with social outbreaks and those who have medical restrictions i.e. diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, government disorders, high blood pressure and compromised immune systems have been advised by the CDC to stay at home for the purpose of “interference use” in the purpose of severe disease and disorder. In the latter half of March 2020, the CDC advises such individuals to stay at home as to maintain physical distances.
The use of the term “social distancing” had resulted in people being completely isolated from each other in alternative ways rather than encouraging them to stay in touch socially. Some officials have issued sexual health guidelines during this global pandemic.
It includes recommendations for having sex with people you live with and those who have not been infected with the virus or have no symptoms.
Those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have suspected that they have been infected have recommended self-isolation at home.
Health institutions have given appropriate instructions on how to self-isolate. Many governments have ordered or recommended the isolation of the entire population living in areas where the infection has spread.
Self-isolation of the most severe form of self-isolation has been suggested for those in high-risk groups.
Those who are likely to have come in contact with a COVID-19 infected person and those who have recently traveled to a country or region that has been infected with a wide range of infections have been advised to self-isolate for 14 days from the last time of contact.
Preventing or preventing the spread and mitigating the spread are the only measures to control the outbreak.
Prevention of transmission is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and its purpose is to track, isolate those who have been infected, as well as to plan infection control measures and to vaccinate others so that the disease does not spread to the population.
When it is not possible to prevent the spread of the disease, steps are taken towards eradicating the disease: measures are taken to slow the spread and measures are taken to reduce its impact on the health system and society.
Both measures can be put together to prevent and reduce the spread.
To prevent spread, more extreme measures have to be taken to reverse the global pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1. As part of the planning of the infectious disease, efforts are made to reduce the intensity of the spread which is called flattening the spread diagram.
It reduces the risk of stress on health services and gives time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Immunological deterrents that can manage outbreaks include hand hygiene, masking and self-isolation, closure of schools, banning large gatherings, encouraging the community to over-impact such interventions as over-impacting and including social distancing measures aimed at physical distancing, as well as inculcating a full range of personal preventive measures that can lead to outbreaks.
Other countries have also adopted various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has started conducting large-scale tests and isolating at the local level and has warned to be careful about the movements of infected people.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those who self-isolated and penalized those who could not.
Taiwan has increased the production of face masks and imposed punishments for storing medical supplies. Simulating the UK and the United Nations are major challenges in preventing and preventing the spread of the disease (reduce the spread of the pandemic, not stopping it) and reversing the growth of the pandemic.
Adaptive plans to reduce the spread of disease can reduce the high demand for healthcare by 2/3 and lead to death by half but still lead to thousands of deaths and huge stress on health systems.
It may be a priority to prevent or suppress the spread of the virus, but it needs to be maintained continuously until the virus is spread to the human community (or until the vaccine is available, if it occurs earlier), otherwise the infection spreads again after the measures are relaxed.
Overtime interventions to prevent or suppress the spread of the pandemic lead to economic and social losses.
There are no specific antiviral drugs for COVID-19, but efforts are underway to develop them, which includes testing of available drugs.
Taking cold medicines, drinking fluids and rest in medical stores can help reduce symptoms.
The need for oxygen treatment, fluid intake from the vein, and respiratory support may be felt as intense.
The use of steroids can worsen the effects.
Several such compounds that have previously been approved to treat other viral diseases are being researched to treat COVID-19.
The WHO has also said that "traditional and home remedies" can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2.
The WHO has said that capacity building and health care for COVID-19 patients is a fundamental measure to respond to the outbreak.
The ECDC and the European Divisional Office of the WHO have issued guidelines for transporting available resources to hospitals and primary health care at various levels, focusing on laboratory services for COVID-19 tests, eliminating alternative methods if possible, isolating COVID-19 testing positive patients, and training staff and increasing availability of available ventilators and beds, etc., to increase vulnerability capabilities, including
There are many theories as to where the first case (the so-called zero number patient) was found.
The first case of the novel coronavirus can be traced back to Wuhan, Hubei, China on December 1, 2019.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei increased gradually.
Their relationship was mostly with the wholesale market of Hunan sea foods, in which even living animals were sold, and one theory is that the virus came from similar animals, or in other words, the virus is the origin of the virus. A group of pneumonia patients, caused by unknown causes, was found on December 26 and was told by Dr. Zhang Jishiyuan on December 27 at Hubei Provincial Hospital, Wuhan.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about the SARS-like coronavirus.
Of these, eight doctors, including Lee Wenling, were warned by the police about spreading false rumours, and another, the mother, Feyn, was strongly warned by her superiors.
The Wuhan Municipal Commission later issued a notice to the public and informed the WHO.
Many cases of unknown pneumonia were reported to health officials in Wuhan, which led to an investigation in early January. The number of cases doubled every seven and a half days in the early stages of the outbreak.
The virus spread to other regions of China in early January 2020 and mid-January 2020 due to the Chinese New Year's migration and Wuhan being the hub of transportation and a major railway change or junction.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that PHEIC is caused by the threat of global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries where health systems are not able.
Responding to the restrictions imposed on travel, Tedros said there was "no need to take unnecessary measures that interfere with international travel and trade" and "the WHO does not recommend imposing restrictions on trade and movements."
On February 5, the World Health Organization (WHO) called on the global community to provide $675 million in aid to low-income countries as part of a planned preparedness fund, and saw the urgency to support countries that did not have a system to detect people infected with the virus, even if the virus began to spread.
"We are as strong as our weakest chain" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more tomorrow."The WHO named the disease Covid-19 at a press conference on February 11.
On the same day, Tedros said that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has agreed to give the power of the entire UN system to respond.
As a result, a UN crisis management group was activated and allowed to coordinate the response of the entire United Nations, which the WHO says will enable them to focus on health response and use other agencies to bear the impact of their expertise on more extensive social, economic and development.
On 14 February, a joint group of WHO initiatives with China was started to provide international and WHO experts to help local management in China, and to help prepare for the outbreak, take a workshop on the severity of the disease and infection in China, and hold a meeting with key national-level institutions to assess the global response to the outbreak. The WHO called for a further assessment of the outbreak to be done by the WHO, and the world could meet on 25 February to assess the impact of response to the urban and rural practices in the region and country-level urban areas.
In response to the outbreak in Iran, the WHO sent a joint campaign group to investigate the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said a global investigation of the coronavirus threat was "higher" than "higher", meaning it would be elevated to the highest level of alerting and risk checking.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's health emergency program, warned in a statement that it was time for every government on earth to check the reality.
The virus is coming and you should be prepared, he urged that the right response measures will help the world avoid the worst.
Ryan went on to say that the current information did not warn public health officials to declare it as a global disease, and that declaring it would mean that we are basically accepting that every human on this planet will be exposed to the virus.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic.
The Managing Director said that the WHO is "extremely concerned about the increasing levels of disease transmission and the dangerous levels of intensity and inactivity". There has been a lot of criticism at the WHO for pointing out that it has been unfairly handled with the global public health emergency, including late declaration of public health emergency and categorization of the virus as a global contagion.
The adverse reactions included a petition seeking the resignation of WHO Managing Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, which was signed by 733,000 people as of April 6.
On March 26, 2020, human rights experts called for the importance of respecting the rights of every person during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The experts said that everyone has a right to life-saving intervention and it is the responsibility of the government.
The group stressed that lack of means or lack of health insurance should not be used to explain the discrimination of a particular group.
Experts underscored that everyone has the right to health, including people with disabilities, minorities, elderly people, internally displaced people, homeless people, people living in extreme poverty, detained people as well as those in need of assistance from other governments.
International government agencies are resolving the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has launched a platform that provides timely and comprehensive information about response plans around the world and similar opinions and suggestions.
From health systems and plans to enabling the global economy to addressing the impact of lockdowns and travel restrictions, digital hubs involve tracking the country's plans, and its goal is to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government has also been criticised by the United States, UK Cabinet Office Minister Michael Glove and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's son Eduardo Bolsonaro for their handling of the global outbreak in China's Hubei province.
Several administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) at the provincial level were fired for handling their attempt to secede in central China, which was a sign of dissatisfaction with the reaction of the established political party to that part of the outbreak.
Some critics believe that the move was aimed at protecting the Chinese Communist Party's general secretary <0x58>i Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, have ruled out the origin of COVID-19 from the US or Italy, arguing that the initial outbreak of the coronavirus originated from Wuhan.
Donald Trump's US administration has called the coronavirus a "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus" and said that China's "privacy has made a virus so dominant that it has become a global partner" that some critics have criticized as racist and "removed the failure of its own administration to control the disease."
The Daily Beast received a telegram from the U.S. government that contained the message of a clumsy formula of deception to the enemy that had its origins in the National Security Council, and in which the plan was said to have "everything about China."
We are told to try and expose this message to the press conferences and on television, etc. Media such as Politico, Forrin Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that the attempt to send aid to the virus-hit areas of China is an attempt to promote a global dominance.
Josep Borrell, the chief of EU foreign policy, warned that by a renegotiation and "politics of liberality" is a geopolitical element encompassing the treachery of dominance.
Borrell also said that China is aggressively sending a message that it is more a responsible and confident partner than the US.
China has asked the US to lift sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, and has also reportedly sent aid to Venezuela and Iran.
Jack Macchi's 100,000 masks for Cuba were blocked by U.S. sanctions on April 3.
U.S. officials are also accused of turning their aid to other countries.
Other countries have also reported mask-related disputes, for example Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and the Czech Republic and Italy.
As a result of this, Turkey seized hundreds of ventilators for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government accused the European Union of lacking a sense of unity with Italy, which had contracted the virus.
Maurizio Masari, Italy's ambassador to the EU, said: "Only China responded bilaterally."
"This is not a good sign for the United States."
On March 22, after a telephone conversation with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin planned to send military equipment, sterilizing special vehicles and other medical supplies to Italy.
Italy's La Stampa newspaper, based on an unknown "high-level political source," said that 80% of the aid material sent by Russia was useless or of little use to Italy.
The source accused Russia of carrying out an offensive campaign of "geopolitical and diplomatic" persuasion.
Italian Foreign Minister Luigi de Maio and Lombardi President Attilao Fontana have denied the reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane carrying medical supplies to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Piskov said: "While offering assistance to U.S. allies, [Putin] assumes that when U.S. manufacturers of medical materials and goods pick up speed, they will also pay back the same amount if needed."
NATO's planned "Defender 2020" military program will be in short form in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states, which was NATO's largest since the end of the Cold War.
Kate Hudson, Secretary-General of the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign, criticized the Defender 2020 program: “In the current public health crisis, this program not only threatens the militaries of the US and many other European countries, but also endangers the country in which they are working, as well as the country in which the infection has spread to the country’s former members. The virus has had a huge impact on the Iranian government and is almost twofold.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has written a public letter to global leaders for help on March 14, 2020, stating that his country is struggling to cope with the outbreak as international markets have no access to international markets due to sanctions against him. The outbreak has prompted the United States to adopt a more generalized public health plan for other wealthy countries, including Universal Health Care, Universal Healthcare, Universal Universal Health Care.
Political analysts predict that this will have a negative impact on Donald Trump's re-election in the 2020 presidential election, which has disrupted diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea.
South Korea has criticized Japan's "suspicious and passive attempts to de-escalate" when Japan announced that everyone coming from South Korea would be quarantined for two weeks at a place designated by the government.
South Korean society was initially polarized or unitary about the response to the crisis of President Moon Jae-in.
Many Koreans either agree with the government’s pleas to impeach or praise Moon for handling the outbreak of cholera. Countries can make emergency laws in response to this global pandemic.
Some critics have expressed concern that this would give governments an opportunity to tighten their grip on power.
In Hungary, his parliament has voted to allow his Prime Minister Viktor Orban to rule indefinitely by decree, to dissolve parliament and elections, and to govern those who are believed to have spread misinformation about the virus, and to help the government cope with the crisis.
The outbreak of the coronavirus has been blamed on a number of incidents including a shortage of supplies, which is generated by the increased use of equipment to deal with the outbreak globally, panic buying and disruptions to the factory and transportation.
The United States Food and Drug Administration warned of a shortage of medicines and medical supplies due to increased consumer demand and disruption to suppliers.
Many areas witnessed panic buying and as a result, essential groceries such as food, toilet paper and bottled water were destroyed from the fruit of the shops, resulting in shortage of supply items.
The technology industry has been warned of the delay in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to WHO Managing Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
As a result of this increased demand, prices have risen to twenty times the usual price and the supply of medical goods has been delayed by four to six weeks.
As a result, personal protective equipment has also become scarce around the world, and the WHO has warned that it will put health workers at risk.
With this global pandemic in Australia, Daigu shoppers have a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
This action led to a shortage of baby formulas in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. In northern Italy and Wuhan, both parts of the country have survived a severe food shortage, despite high COVID-19 cases and high demand for upcoming foods.
Measures against the illegal trade of stockpiles and essentials of China and Italy have been successful, and the acute shortage of food was avoided in Europe and North America.
In northern Italy, there has been no significant decline in agricultural production, but the prices may increase according to the representatives of the industries.
In Wuhan, there was only a temporary shortage of food items, while Chinese authorities opened pork stocks to feed the population.
There are similar laws in Italy, which require food producers to reserve food for such emergencies.
According to a March 16 media report, China's economy has been severely affected by measures taken by the Chinese government to contain the spread of the virus in the first two months of 2020, and retail sales have fallen by 20.5%.
China's mainland is the main economy and the hub of production, with the outbreak of the virus being seen as a major threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicts that markets will remain volatile until the possible consequences are clear.
In January 2020, some analysts predicted that the global economic slowdown due to the disease would overtake the time of the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.

The Central Bank of India has been responding more sharply than during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the worst affected sectors due to the closure of public places, including tourist attractions, and governments advising them not to travel anywhere around the world.
As a result, many airlines have cancelled their flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Quantas, while British regional airline Flyby has closed.
The impact on the maritime industry has reached a level never seen before.
Many railway stations and passenger boats have been closed.
This pandemic came during the Chinese New Year holiday season, the main traveler of the Chinese New Year holiday.
Several large gatherings were cancelled by national and local governments, including annual New Year's celebrations, as well as private companies personally closing their shops and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many solar New Year's events and tourist attractions were closed to prevent large crowds from gathering, including the Farbidden City in Beijing and the Jats of traditional cemeteries.
Authorities in 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions extended New Year's holidays until February 10, and ordered most of the workplaces not to open until that date.
These parts represent 80 per cent of the GDP of the country and 90 per cent of exports.
Hong Kong has raised its level of response to infection disease the most and declared an emergency, shut down schools until March and canceled New Year celebrations. The retail market area has had a global impact and the times of the shops have been reduced or the shops have been temporarily closed.
In Europe and Latin America, the number of customers coming to retail stores has decreased by 40%.
North America and the Middle East have declined by 50-60%.
As a result, there has been a 33-43% decline in buyers at Payi Hind shopping centre in February compared to March.
Shopping mall operators around the world have made it mandatory to install thermal scanners to monitor the temperature of customers, and more measures to cancel the event. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, more than 14 to 22 million people in Latin America will be pushed into extreme poverty if they are in situations where they are without this global partner.
When the pandemic was at its peak in Wuhan, nearly 5 million people lost their jobs in China in January and February.
Nearly 300 million rural migrant workers in China have been stuck at home or stranded in Hubei province. More than 10 million Americans lost their jobs in March 2020 and applied for government assistance.
The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates that 47 million jobs could be lost in the United States due to the outbreak of the coronavirus and the unemployment rate could go up to 32%. Tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who have been paid on daily wages) have lost their jobs since the lockdown in India. Nearly 900 jobs have been lost since mid-March. A survey by Angus Reid found that 44% of Canadian households had experienced some type of unemployment.
In the second part of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment allowances, and one million British workers applied for Universal Credit Schemes. In Germany, about five million companies sent their workers to work on short-term work plans called Kurtsarabyte, a government subsidy.
Germany's short-term work compensation plan has been adopted by France and Britain.
The fine arts and cultural traditions of the presentation have profoundly affected these areas of the global pandemic and have affected organizations and individuals both at the global level - employed and non - employed.
Organizations in the arts and culture sector have made efforts to continue their campaign (mostly publicly funded) which included giving the community the opportunity to experience cultural traditions, maintaining the safety of their employees in public places and helping artists whenever possible.
As of March 2020, museums, libraries, museums, museums and other cultural institutions around the world were closed indefinitely and their exhibitions, events and presentations were cancelled or postponed.
In response, there was a strong effort to provide alternative services through the digital platform. One of the more fast-paced forms of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other concerts and social events such as maffles, technical conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry has also experienced disruption. The Vatican announced that the observance of a religious week in Rome which is the last week of Lent's Christian repentance season has been canceled.
Many bishops have asked older Christians to stay at home rather than attend Sunday prayers, with some churches providing church services through radio, online live broadcasts, or television, while some churches offer drive-in worship options.
While the territories under the authority of the Roman Catholic Bishop of Rome were closing their churches and chapels and emptying without the Saint Peter's Square devotees, other religious institutions have also shut down services and restricted the gathering of people in churches, mosques, synagogues, cemeteries, cemeteries and gurdwaras.
Iran's Ministry of Health on Friday cancelled Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and closed after the closing, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims as well as residents from visiting Mecca and Medina.
After World War II, the pandemic has caused massive disruptions to the schedule of sports around the world.
Several important sporting events, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, 2019-20 NBA season and 2019-20 NHL seasons, have been canceled or postponed.
The outbreak has disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that "the schedule of events will be rescheduled after 2020, but it will be before the summer of 2021."
This has led to many gamblers playing online, registering a significant increase in the number of new sign-ups on many online gambling sites. Many groups in music have postponed or canceled concert tours, which has also affected the entertainment industry.
A number of major theaters, such as Broadway, have postponed their experiments.
Some artists have found ways to create art on the Internet and continue to share it as an alternative to traditional real presentations, such as the actual presentation of concerts or the creation of web-based "festivals" for artists to present, distribute and publish their work.
There have been many online internet memes on the topic of coronavirus, many of which work to create and distract humor in this environment of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, <0x58>inophobia, acute prejudice, and hereditary prejudice have been pointed out against the Chinese people and people in the East Asian region as well as people in hotspots in Europe, the US and other countries.
Many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and Asia-Pacific region, have reported incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility.
The February report (when the majority of cases were still confined to China) records show that the Chinese people are capable of transmitting the virus, or that they are receiving a fair change.
There has also been an increase in anti-China sentiment in some African countries.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei, based on regional origins, have reported discrimination.
There is support for the Chinese people both online and offline, as well as for those in areas affected by the virus.
Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe outbreak of COVID-19 after the outbreak of the new hotspot countries, may have also been subjected to suspicion and xenophobia. People from other countries, including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea, initially joined together to ban Chinese people from entering their country as an effort to stop the spread of the disease.
In Japan, <0x23>ChineseDontCamTupan has also become a topic of much discussion on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asian people in England and the United States have reported an increasing number of cases of racism as well as attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump has been criticized for calling the coronavirus a "Chinese virus," with critics calling it racist and anti-China.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked a bus carrying Ukrainian citizens and foreign migrants from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhari.
Students from the Northeast, who come from China's border areas and study in important Indian cities, are reported to have experienced harassment in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, the state-level president of the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, made a statement that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that is why God took vengeance on them."
Later, the Chinese Embassy in Kolkata condemned these slogans, calling them "guilty". <0x58>enophobia and dynasticism have been fueled by companionship against non-Chinese residents, where foreigners are described as "foreign waste" and are targeted for "disposal."
Current newspapers with paywalls have removed some or all of the paywalls for their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publications have been made available freely by scientific research on eucalyptus.
Some scientists have chosen a way to quickly share their results on preprint servers like BioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for respiratory-related coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus include antiviral detection methods that detect the presence of the virus and in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the test is ensured by the RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is designed only to detect RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to ensure that there is a recent or active infection.
Antibiotic investigations can be used for both diagnosis and close monitoring of population.
Antibiotic tests show how many people had the disease, including people with very minor symptoms or people with no symptoms to mention.
The results of this test can determine the exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of immunity of the population.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country had reliable information about the spread of the virus in their population.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there has been a huge divergence in the number of tests conducted between the countries.
This variability is also likely to significantly affect the reported case fatality rate, which is also likely to be largely unreasonable in some countries.
The real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) can be tested on respiratory samples obtained through a variety of methods, including the nasal swab or spitting sample.
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
An RT-PCR test is performed in the first week of the disease.
The virus can then be eliminated from the throat and its number in the lungs continues to grow rapidly.
During the second week of testing of infected persons, a sample may be taken by a suction catheter from deep airway or a post-crushing component (shrink) may be used as an option.
In January 2020, one of the initial PCR tests was developed at Charity in Berlin that used real-time reverse transcription polymer chain reaction (RRT-PCR) and was the infrastructural component of the 250,000 test sets available for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
England had also developed the test by 23 January 2020. On 28 January 2020, the South Korean company CogeneBiotech developed a clinical grade, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerCheck coronavirus).
This test detects the "E" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses and the RdRp gene that is specific to SARS-CoV-2. BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from China’s National Medical Products Administration for the SARS-CoV-2 detection set in China. The RICO-Reint-CDC was one of the first to receive emergency use approval from China’s National Medical Products Administration for the SARS-CoV-2 detection.
One in three of the older versions of the test kits caused inconclusive results due to defective Regents and hampered trials at the CDC in Atlanta; the result was that an average of less than 100 samples per day were successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Till 28th February 2020, the trials using two components were not considered to be conclusive, and till then state-level and local laboratories were not allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authorization. Professional laboratories in the US began testing in early March 2020.
On 5th March 2020, Lab Corp announced the availability of COVID-19 tests based on RT-PCR across the country.
Similarly, on 9th March 2020, Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 testing available across the country.
No limits were declared on the scale; the sample collection and processing had to be done in accordance with the CDC requirements.
The COVID-19 test was developed and manufactured in Russia by the State Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology, Vector.
The test was registered by the Federal Service on 11th February 2020 to monitor healthcare. On 12th March 2020, Mayo Clinic had a record of developing the test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13th March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a large-scale 3.5-hour trial, thus allowing one machine to conduct approximately 4,128 tests over a 24-hour period.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA gave the Abbot Laboratory Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to test the Abbot M2000 system; the FDA had earlier given such authorization to the Holographic, Labcorp and Thermo Fisher Cyclist.
On March 21, 2020, SAFID received the EUA for a test conducted by the FDA in approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid application technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can give fixed results and negative results in as little as five minutes and 13 minutes.
At present, there are approximately 18,000 such machines in the US and Abbott expects to increase production to 50,000 tests a day. A test using monoclonal antibiotics that specifically binds the novel coronavirus's nucleocapsid protein (N protein) is being developed in Taiwan. It is expected that the test will be developed as soon as 15 to 20 minutes.
In March 2020, it was concluded that "the chest <0x58>-rays are less useful for diagnosing early stages, while CT [computed tomography] findings may be present before symptoms begin."
Typical features of the CT include minor odd lateral distribution with bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacity.
As the disease progresses, supplemental dominoes, crazies and aggregation develop.
A comparative study of PCR and CT in Wuhan at the root of the current pandemic has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR since it incorporates other pneumonia and disease processes with many of its imaging features.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "Cit should not be used as a test to be carried out in the first place, preferably for testing or diagnosing COVID-19." The CDC recommends PCR for early detection by March 2020.
Antibiotics are produced along with IgM and IgG as part of the immune response to the infection.
Those tests can be used to detect infection, determine immunity and monitor the population, approximately 7 days after the onset of symptoms. Tests can be done at the Central Laboratory (CLT) or through Point of Care Testing (POCT).
Many clinical laboratories will be able to test these large-scale automated systems produced by processing them over a certain period of time, but their availability will depend on the cost of production for each system.
Although several samples can be used to track an immune response, a single sample of peripheral blood is commonly used for CLT.
A single sample of blood is usually obtained by skin puncture for POCT.
Unlike PCR methods, there is no need for extrusion before inspection. On 26 March 2020, the FDA released the names of 29 components that gave the agency instructions as needed and therefore they are able to deliver their antibiotic tests.
The FDA has approved only one test under emergency use authorization as of 7 April 2020. At the end of March 2020, Euroimun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitom Diagnostics received approval from the European Union for their test sets, through which IGG and IGA antibodies can be detected in the background of the virus in the blood sample.
The test capacity is such that hundreds of samples can be tested in a few hours and that is why this test virus is several times faster than the traditional PCR test of RNA.
It is generally possible to detect the antibiotic within 14 days after infection. In early April, England did not find it suitable enough to use any set of antibiotics they purchased.
Hong Kong has planned that, in which suspected patients can stay at home, “the emergency department will give the patient a sample tube”, they spit into it, send it back to the patient without a proper diagnosis of the disease, and at some point they get the test result. British NHS has indicated that they have not been conducting an initial study of the plan to test the suspected persons at home, due to which they have come to the hospital.
The Drive Through Centers have helped South Korea conduct the fastest, most comprehensive tests than any other country. On March 2 in Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians demonstrated that they had the ability to conduct approximately 12,000 tests a day in the rotating system and that 10.700 people had been tested in the previous week.
When a doctor is asked to do a test, his expenses are covered by health insurance.
According to Robert Koch, Germany has a capacity to conduct 1,60,000 tests per week.
By March 19th, the drive-in tests were offered in many major cities.
The total number of tests conducted in Germany as of 26 March 2020 was not known, as only positive results were recorded.
In the first survey of the lab, it was found that a total of 4,83,295 samples were tested till 12/2020 of the calendar and a total of 4,83,295 samples were tested in the 12/2020 week and more than 10,491 samples (6.9%) of samples were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on the following day.
Construction was carried out in 5 days under the supervision of BGI founder Wang <0x58>ian and this modelling has shown that if this testing capacity had not been started on time, Hubei would have seen 47% more cases and the corresponding cost of quarantine handling would have doubled.
Wuhan laboratory has been closely followed by Huo-Yan labs in 12 cities in China, such as Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai.
As on 4th March 2020, there were 50,000 tests per day. The Open Source multiplex design, published by Origami Esage, can test samples of as many as 1122 patients for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced designs can be used in small labs without a robotic liquid handler.
As of March, there has been a shortage of reactants and insufficient quantities for large-scale trials in the EU, UK and the US.
This led some authors to start experimenting with sample preparation protocols that included heating the sample to 98 degrees Celsius (208 degrees Fahrenheit) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for the next test. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now testing a higher number of people in their population than any other country, and testing to reach a higher number of highs.
This was due to the combination of drive through capability and the purchase of wholesale throughput labs in proportion to the population from Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency research labs in China).
Built in 14 days, this laboratory is capable of conducting thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first in the world to have such a large-scale conductive outside of China.
Various tests were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile.
The World Health Organization (WHO) accepted Germany’s action to send a set of manufacturing to low-income countries with no resources to build their own set.
The German action was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control was not available until January 28, which led to pending trials in the United States. In the early stages of the outbreak, China and the U.S. had problems with the reliability of test sets, and these countries and Australia were unable to supply enough sets to meet the recommendations of testing from demand and health experts.
On the contrary, large-scale testing in South Korea has helped reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Large-scale testing capacity in private sector labs was created over many years by the South Korean administration.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization ordered an extension of the testing program as the best way to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The large-scale spread of the virus led to a huge demand for testing that led to the backlog of hundreds of tests in private laboratories in the US and a shortage of swabs and chemical agents.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test sets.
The test set developed by the CDC in the U.S. was "guilty"; then the government removed barriers to bureaucracy that prevented private testing. Spain bought the test set from a Chinese company, Shenzhen Bioizie Biotechnology Co. Ltd., but its results were found to be incorrect.
The company explained that failure to collect samples or use the set properly may have resulted in incorrect results.
The Spanish Ministry said that they would return the incorrect results set and instead give a separate test set supplied by Shenzhen Bioizie. 80% of the test sets purchased by the Czech Republic from China were incorrect. Slovakia purchased 1.2 lakh test sets from China which were found to be defective.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that these sets should be dropped in Danube. Attas Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that Turkey had "large amounts of gum" in the sets purchased by China and that they were "not used." The UK bought 3.5 million test sets from China but announced in early April 2020 that they were not usable.
The testing, subsequent isolation of the test positive and tracking of those who came in contact with SARS-CoV-2 positive, yielded good results.
In Italy, where the first Covid-19 death occurred, researchers working in the Italian city, carried out two rounds of testing at an estimated 10-day interval of about 3,400 people.
About half of those who tested positive had no symptoms and were isolated.
With the limited travel of the society life, the new infection was completely avoided.
With aggressive tracking of contacts, restrictions on internal travel, testing and quarantine, the spread of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has been much slower than in other developed countries and there have been no forced closures of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events have been canceled and Singapore began advising citizens to stay at home from March 28, but schools reopened on March 23 at a time set after the holiday.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have managed the pandemic by aggressively tracking contact, banning domestic travel, testing and quarantine, but through a less aggressive lockdown.
Statistical studies have found that countries with higher mortality rates have a much lower mortality rate than those with only mild or no symptoms.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that countries that do not have testing capability and have limited experience in COVID-19 should send their first five positive and first ten negative samples to one of the 16 laboratories referred to by the World Health Organization for testing.
Of the 16 labs, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
The following table shows the effect of the country's testing policy on the "percentage of tests positive."
While other factors are similar, symptoms are not seen or seen, but the tests will be more positive than those of the country which tests only the people who are admitted in the hospital.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand washing, is the act of hand washing done by one for the purpose of removing soil, lubricant, microorganisms or other unwanted elements.
Washing your hands regularly during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and rashes, which are spread by the mouth.
Respiratory diseases such as influenza or colds can also infect people, for example, if they have not washed their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous skin).
Five important times of the day when it is important to wash hands with soap are: before and after going to the toilet, after cleaning the baby's chin or after changing the length of the chin, before and after the baby's milking, before and after eating and cooking food, or before and after handling the birds in raw meat, fish or poultry.
If water and soap are not available, handwashing can be done by hand, the World Health Organization recommends washing hands at the following times:
Before, after, and after cooking.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing the longcoat or after washing the trunks of a child who has been sledged.
After sneezing, coughing or sneezing.
After touching an animal, animal, or animal.
Cleanliness of medical hands means hygiene habits related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before taking medication or medical care will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The primary medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse hands from pathogenic substances (bacterium, virus or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harmful or disease.
This is especially important for those who handle food or work in the medical field, but is also an important habit for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
This includes reducing the infant mortality rate at home.
A 2013 study found that improved hand washing practices could lead to minor improvements in the height of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, early childhood mortality associated with respiratory and diarrhoea diseases can be reduced by introducing simple changes in behavior such as hand washing with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by almost 50%.
The interventions that stimulate hand washing can reduce diarrhea incidence by about one-third and can be compared with the supply of clean water in a low-income segment.
A 48% reduction in diarrhoea incidence can be related to hand washing with soap. Hand washing is the only effective and affordable way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infection (ARI) in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, which has a major ARI, is one of the leading causes of death in children under the age of five, leading to the death of approximately 18 lakh children each year.
An estimated 35 lakh children die each year from diarrhoea and pneumonia.
According to UNICEF, more lives can be saved by making a habit of washing hands with soap before eating and after going to the toilet, than with any vaccine or medical intervention, leading to nearly half of the deaths caused by diarrhea and one-fourth of the deaths caused by acute respiratory infections.
Handwashing is usually combined with other hygiene interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (wash) programs.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo, which is spread through direct physical contact.
The small harmful effect of hand washing is that continuous hand washing can lead to skin damage due to dry skin.
A study in Denmark conducted in 2012 found that too much hand washing can lead to a skin condition such as eating hands, getting rid of her paws, which is commonly found in health care workers.
Washing hands too often is also considered a symptom of the concept-action Essentials Disorder (OCD).
There are five important times during the day when it is important to wash your hands with soap to reduce the spread of the disease by touching my mouth: when you go to the bathroom (laughing, defecation), after cleaning the baby's chin (after changing the length), before the baby's milk, before eating and after cooking, or after handling raw meat, fish or poultry class birds.
Other occasions when appropriate hand washing techniques should be adopted to prevent the spread of the disease include the following, before and after treatment of cut or other injuries; after sneezing, coughing or sneezing; after touching the animal's buttocks or after touching the animal and after touching the trash.
In many countries, the amount of soap is low.
A 2015 study in 54 countries found that on average 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that the highest hand washing rate in Saudi Arabia is 95 percent, about 77 percent in the United States, and the lowest 23 percent in China to encourage children to wash their hands. Some behavioral practices are now showing signs of increasing handwashing at school.
The "Compulsory Health Care Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a measure of action for the upliftment of children's health and education.
Demolition of germs twice a year, washing hands daily with soap, brushing your teeth with fluoride, is an integral part of the national programme.
It has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Removal of microorganisms from the skin is enhanced by the use of soap or detergents with water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the restriction of the solution and increase the solubility.
Only water is not enough to clean the skin because the fat and proteins containing organic soil elements do not dissolve in water immediately.
However, purification is done by proper flow of water..
Due to the nature of our reuse, there is a possibility of bacteria from previous use in solid soaps.
Some studies on the migration of bacteria through infected solid soaps have concluded that their migration is not possible due to the loss of bacteria from the face.
The CDC continues to say that “hand-touch liquid soap is preferable for use”.
Antibiotic soaps have been widely used in health care.
As of today, there is no evidence of the use of antiseptic or disinfectant recommended for antibiotic-resistance in nature.
However, antibiotic soaps contain common antimicrobial elements such as triclosan, which have a wide list of resistant strains of organisms.
Therefore, although antibiotics for disinfectant soaps have not been selected, they may not be as effective as stated.
In addition to surfactant and skin-protective agents, refined formulations such as pH regulators contain effective formulations like acid (acetic acid ascorbic acid, lactic acid), disease-resistant activated benzoic acid and other skin conditioners that can be generalized by the University of Aurangzeb.
Hot water that is comfortable to wash hands is not enough to kill germs.
The germs grow rapidly at body temperature (37 degrees C).
However, warm water is more effective than soapy cold water in extracting natural oils containing soil and germs from the hand.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies have shown that warm water is not effective at reducing microorganism loads from the hands.
Hand sanitiser or hand antiseptic water based hand hygiene agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-water based hand hygiene agents (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, antiseptic hand rubs, or hand sanitizers) began to become popular.
Most of them contain isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulations, such as carbomers (polymers of acrylic acid) as gel forms or in moist liquid forms such as glycerin, or are easy to use and face to reduce the effect of alcohol dryness.
Mild hydrogen-peroxide enhances antibiotic activity. Hand sanitizers contain at least 60 to 90 percent alcohol-effective insecticides.
Alcohol Rab Sanitizer germs, multi-medicine resistant germs (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and some germs (including HIV, Harpez, RSV, Rhinovirus, Vaccines, Influenza and Hepatitis) and hemorrhoids
Alcohol Rab Sanitizer contains 70% alcohol and within 30 seconds after it is applied 99.97% of the hands (3.5 log reduction equal to 35 decibels reduction) and 99.99% to 99.999% (effectively reducing 4 to 5 logs) of the germs.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer is completely ineffective against germs such as norovirus (or norwalk), which is the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. A lot of hand antiseptic or alcohol rubber should be used to completely clean both hands.
The front and back of both hands and the space between all the fingers should be soaked for about 30 seconds until the liquid, face or gel is melted.
Wash your fingernails thoroughly, soaking them both in the ground. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that hand sanitiser be applied after washing your hands when the hands are dirty.
The use of these agents is increasing based on simple use and the act of killing micro-organisms at a rapid pace; however, they should not act as a replacement for washing hands properly if soap and water are not available.
The frequent use of alcohol-based sanitizers can cause dryness of the skin, so add skin softener and/or moisturizer.
This formula may reduce or eliminate the effect of alcohol-drying by adding glycerin and/or other skin softening substances.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emulants reduce skin irritation and dryness than soaps or antibiotic detergents.
Allergic contact is rarely found in skin disease, contact gallbladder syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or substance present in hand rubs.
Compared to washing hands with soap and water, a low tendency was to induce skin disease.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water agents do not wash the hands of organic materials, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, hand sanitizer is not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of pathogens as the pathogens remain on hand.
The efficiency of an alcohol-free hand sanitizer depends on a very large number of factors and formulations and has historically lagged significantly behind alcohol and alcohol reflux.
Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have shown continuous and stored antimicrobial activity, unlike alcohol, where efficacy after repeated use has been shown to be low, perhaps due to a progressive adverse skin reaction.
Many people in the low-income group do not afford soap and they use ash and soil.
Ash and soil can be more effective than just water but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it will increase the spread of the disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, soil is also a disinfectant because when soil is exposed to water, an alkaline solution is formed.
The WHO recommends using ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
The exact hand washing techniques recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control to prevent the spread of the disease include the following steps:
Wash your hands with warm or running water.
Flowing water is recommended because permanent basins can be contaminated, and water temperatures do not seem to make much difference.
Apply a lot of soap, apply it on the back of the hands, under the fingers, under the nails, and make a face.
The germs on the skin are removed with soap, and studies have shown that people tend to wash their hands more systematically when soap is used than just water to wash their hands.
Hold your hand for at least 20 seconds.
Bleaching causes abrasion, which leads to the removal of germs on the skin and the removal of more germs due to excessive time sucking.
Wash your hands with clean water.
Washing hands in the basin can lead to contamination.
Wash your hands with a clean handkerchief or allow the air to dry.
The wet and wet hands are contaminated quickly back. The thumb, wrist, fingers, and the lower part of the nails are the parts that are normally squeezed to wash the hands.
Artificial nails and semi-detached nails can provide shelter to microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended to avoid hand drying; dry skin can damage the skin which can increase the risk of infection.
Various low-cost options can be made for the convenience of hand washing in places where tap water and/or soaps are not available, e.g. in a developing country if required, to pour water from a hanging jerrycan or apes with suitable holes and/or use ash. Limited water supply conditions (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries) are options such as "tippy taps", "tippy taps and other prices"
Tipi tap is a simple technique in which a can is anchored with a rope to pour a little water on the hand and on the soap, and a lever that can move on the foot.
Effective drying of hands is an essential part of the cleaning process, but there is little debate about the most effective type of drying in a public washroom.
An increasing amount of research indicates that paper towels are much healthier than the electric hand dryers in many washrooms.
In 2008 the University of Westminster London conducted a study to compare the level of cleanliness offered by paper towels, hand dryers using hot air and modern jet-air hand dryers, and the European tissue symposium, the paper industry sponsored the study.
After drying hands with a hot air dryer, the number of bacteria on the fingers increased by an average of 194%, while the number on the ground floor increased by 254%.
After the drying of the jet air dryer, the total number of bacteria on the fingers increased by an average of 42%, while the number on the bottom increased by 15%.
After drying hands with paper towels, the total number of bacteria on the fingers was reduced by an average of 76% and the number on the bottom by 77%. As a result of each type of drying method, other washroom users and washroom environments were tested to check whether there was a possibility of contamination.
The jet air dryer that throws air out of the unit at a speed of 180 meters per second (650 km/h; 400MPh) is capable of blowing microorganisms out of the hand and unit and polluting the washroom users and the washroom environment up to 2 meters long.
Microorganisms are spread from dryer to 0.25 meters using a hot air dryer.
Paper towels did not show any significant spread. In a study conducted by TUV Produkt und Umwelt in 2005, different hand twisting methods were evaluated.
The following changes were observed in the number of bacteria after drying hands:
Many hand dryer manufacturers are in existence, and hand dryers have been compared to drying paper towels.
During the journey, wipes are an option to wash hands when soap and water are not available.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Hungarian physician Ignaz Semelweis made it mandatory to wash medical hands after researching its effectiveness to prevent disease in the hospital environment (in 1846).
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
Studies have shown that their use has reduced the number of infections.
Medical hand washing is at least 15 seconds, which involves using a large amount of soap and water or gel and washing every part of the hand.
The hands should be glued together.
If there is a hole in the nails, a bristle brush can be used to remove it.
It is important to wash your hands and wipe with a clean handkerchief so that germs can remain in the water on your hands.
After drying, use a paper handkerchief to close the water (and to open the exit door if necessary)
This will prevent the hands from getting dirty again.
In healthcare, the purpose of hand washing is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("invertebrates") and to prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reported that the lack of hand washing in many medical environments has remained at an unacceptable level, where doctors and nurses routinely forget to wash their hands before touching patients, leading to microorganisms infection.
One study found that proper hand washing and other simple methods can reduce blood flow infections related to catheters by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a leaflet containing the ideal methods of hand-washing and hand-washing in the health care sector.
The guidelines on hand hygiene by the Institute can also be found on their website for public comments.
Whitby and others had combined the relevant reviews.
If a demonstration of regular compliance is required, professional tools can measure and standardize hand hygiene.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has five "minutes" to wash hands:
When it comes to blood/body
Prior to the demolition, and
After taking care of the patient. If there is an abundance of antiseptic chemicals in the soap (the "medicine" or "microscopic" soap) the act of killing the hand in the washing liquid.
Before surgery or at a place where an antibiotic-resistant organism is large enough to cause such a beating, the hand for surgical conduct may be a sterile towel for hand washing, chlorhexidine or iodine wash without touching it with hands, sterile towels to dry the hands after hand washing and other sterile brushes to moisturize.
All the ornaments should be removed.
For this procedure, it is usually necessary to wash the hands and wrists for 2-6 minutes.
It doesn't take long (10 minutes).
When washing, water from the wrist to the elbow area should be avoided to return back to the hands.
Upon completion of hand-washing, the hands are dryed with sterile cloth and surgical gowns are mounted on the body.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands before and after taking care of a sick person or using a hand disinfectant.
For the control of Staphylococcus infection in the hospital, it was found that the biggest benefit of hand washing was from the first 20% of washing and when the frequency of hand washing was increased by more than 35%, there was a slight increase in the benefit.
Washing hands with simple soap is more than three times the rate of bacterial infection in food when compared to antimicrobial soaps. As per 30 seconds per day, hand-washing with an alcohol-based solution and hand-washing with anti-bacterial soap resulted in a reduction in the dose of the disinfectant by 26%.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based liquids to reduce H1N1 influenza A virus and claustridium from hard germs to hand-to-hand. To improve hand health interventions in healthcare settings, employees can be trained on hand-washing, hand-washing alcohol-based fluids can be made more available and staffed with written and oral reminders.
More research is needed to find out which interventions are most effective in various health care settings.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is considered to be a cheap and necessary tool to achieve good health and good nutrition as well.
But due to reliable supply of water, lack of soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces, it has become a challenge to achieve universal hand washing behaviour.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there is a shortage of hand washing taps near every private or public toilet, despite the cheap option available to set up a handwashing space.
However, low hand washing can also be a result of dead habits rather than a lack of soap or water.
The promotion and award of handwashing with soap can affect policy decisions, create awareness about the benefits of hand washing, and alter the long-term behaviour of the population.
It needs monitoring and evaluation to be implemented effectively.
In a systematic study of 70 studies, it was found that a society-based approach is effective in increasing hand washing in LMICs, while social marketing initiatives are less effective. An example encouraging hand washing in schools is a “three-star approach” by UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple, affordable measures to ensure students wash their hands with soap, along with other sanitation needs.
When the minimum standards are met, schools can move from one to three stars at the end.
It may be a part of the initiative to promote hand washing to reduce disease and infant mortality.
The World Handwashing Day, which seeks to change behaviour, is yet another example of an initiative to raise awareness. UNICEF promoted the adoption of handwashing emojis as a result of the coronavirus pandemic in 2019-20.
Some studies have taken into account the impact of the overall cost of hand washing in developing countries in relation to the avoidance of dally.
But, a review suggests that it is significantly cheaper to encourage hand washing with soap than other interventions in water and sanitation.
For people in particularly vulnerable conditions, such as recently-resurred mothers or injured soldiers in hospitals - the first two pioneers working on hand hygiene in the mid-19th century recognized the importance of hand washing for human health: Ignaz Semelvais, a Hungarian physician working in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, "the English founder of modern nursing."
At that time, most people believed that the smell of Miyamas was caused by infection.
In 1980, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States more actively encouraged hand washing as a key measure to prevent the spread of the infection as a result of foodborne outbreaks and health-related infections.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and COVID-19 in 2020 have raised awareness in many countries about the importance of handwashing with soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, murals showing the "right technique of hand washing" in public toilets and office buildings and toilets at the ground floor were placed next to the hand washing sink.
How to wash one's hands is the expression of one's unwillingness to take responsibility for something or to share the complexities of it.
It originates from the Bible passage in Matthew, where Pantheus Pilate washes his hands over his decision to cross the Jizz crystal, but in some English society this rhetoric came with more widespread use.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, she has to forcibly wash in an attempt to wash the hypothetical stain while showing her guilty conscience about the offences committed by Lady Macbeth and the charges levelled against her husband.
It has also been found that people tend to wash their hands more often than others when they are reminded of or contemplated of immoral activities, and they tend to give more importance to the means of washing their hands.
Also, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such contemplation are less likely to engage in other "cleanliness" compensating actions, such as volunteering.
Religions are asked to wash hands for both sanitary and symbolic reasons. Using water to wash hands, but not using soap is a part of the symbolic hand washing ritual, which includes Bah<0xC3><0xA1>’<0xC3><0xAD>s, Hindu, Jewish Tevilahs and Nethilas, Lavabos in Christianity and Wudus in Islam. Religions are asked to wash hands especially for washing after certain actions.
It is mandatory for Hindus, Jews and Muslims to wash their hands after going to the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam, it is mandatory to wash hands before and after every meal.
Control of workplace hazards caused by COVID-19
Control of workplace hazards due to COVID-19 are applications of occupational safety and health practices to control the threat to the prevention of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19)
Proper control of the risk at the workplace depends on the nature of the workplace and the nature of the work, which depends on the source of the infection, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of every worker who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-infectious activities have minimal commercial contact with people and other colleagues, for which original infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home while sick, respiratory etiquette, and regular hygiene and disinfection of the workplace.
Moderate infection risk tasks include tasks that require up-to-date or close contact with those who are not known or suspected to have been infected with COVID-19, but who may have been infected by ongoing community infection or international travel.
This includes workers who are in touch with the general public, such as in schools, areas with dense population and some large retail outlets.
In addition to basic infection prevention measures, risk control for this group includes maintaining air play using high-capacity air-filters, using sneez guards and having personal protective equipment available for a person to deal with COVID-19.
The OSHO considers health workers and mortuary staff who have come in contact with a known or suspected person infected with COVID-19 to be at high risk of exposure, in which the worker is processing aerosols or collecting or handling samples of a known or suspected person with COVID-19, thereby increasing the risk of exposure.
The risk controls suitable for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for that particular task.
COVID-19 can have a huge impact on the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work due to illness, need to care for others, or fear of a possible infection.
In both the sense of which goods are demanded and the way they are procured, commerce patterns may change (e.g., buying or distributing or purchasing through drive-through services when there is less congestion).
Finally, there may be disruption in movement of goods from geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19. Preparedness and response plans for infectious disease can be used to take protective action.
Addresses risk levels schemes associated with various workplaces and activities, including source of infection, risk factors arising from domestic and social sectors, and risk factors of each worker, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also outline contingency plans for situations that may arise due to the necessary controls and outbreaks to address those risks.
Preparedness and response planning for infectious disease may be subject to national or sub-national recommendations.
The goals for responding to an outbreak include reducing transmission among employees, protecting people at risk of complications from health, maintaining a professional pace, and minimizing the adverse impact on other things in their supply chain.
Wherever there is a business, the seriousness of the disease affects the response in the communities of the place.
There is a hierarchy of risk controls that are widely used in occupational safety and health to determine groupings according to the effectiveness of risk controls.
While the risks of COVID-19 cannot be completely eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and, ultimately, personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls include segregating employees from work-related risks without depending on the worker's behavior and can be the cheapest way to implement it.
Administrative controls are those changes in action policies or procedures that require action by a worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered to be less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent some infections.
All types of PPEs should be selected based on the risk to the worker, they should be suitable for use (e.g. respirators) and should be properly applied, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced as needed, and they should be properly removed, cleaned and sanitized, or they should be properly disposed of to avoid infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHO), low-infectious activities have minimal commercial contact with the public and other partners.
It is recommended to adopt basic infection prevention measures for all types of workplaces, including washing hands on top and completely, inducing workers to stay at home if they are sick, following respiratory etiquettes, including coughing and sneezing mouth coverings, regularizing the use of tissue paper and dumping buckets from the workers, preparing to use telecommunication or different shifts, and other tools.
Immediate identification and isolation of potential infected persons is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others at the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who show symptoms of a severe respiratory illness, who have not had a fever for at least 24 hours, have no symptoms or other symptoms, and are flexible with their leave policies to let employees stay at home, allowing employees to take care of their sick family members.
According to OSHA, medium-infectious risk tasks include jobs for which such people are not known or suspected to have been infected with COVID-19, but are likely to be in close contact with people who may have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 due to the ongoing community transmission around the business area or who have recently travelled internationally to a place where the spread of COVID-19 is widespread.
This includes the workers who have come in contact with the general public in the workplaces of the workplaces in the workplace, such as schools, workplaces with a tight population of staff, and workplaces where the workplaces of the workplaces and the workplaces of the workplaces of the workplaces where they have to be trained and the workplaces of the workplaces, where they have access to the workplaces and the workplaces of the workplaces, which is a high-efficiency and a high-efficiency in the workplaces, and high-risk groups for the high-risk groups, and high-risk groups.
This type of equipment is rarely required to use respirators.
Appropriate controls to protect a person who falls sick in an airplane, workers and other passengers include keeping him at a distance of 6 feet from other people, appointing a crew member to serve that sick person, and offering a face mask to the sick person, or asking him to cover his mouth and nose with a tissue paper while coughing or sneezing the sick person.
While serving a sick passenger or touching his physical fluid or potentially infected surfaces, it is necessary to wear disposable medical gloves and if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing, the cabin crew must wear additional personal protective equipment.
Gloves and other disposable items must be disposed of in a biohazard bag and then cleaned and disinfected in infected places. For commercial vessels, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, prolong travel while sick in risk controls and include self-isolation when the ship is on the ship or if there is any other symptoms, and prompt medical center on the ship to be notified immediately.
Ideally, medical follow-up is required in the room of a quarantined person. The CDC recommends temporary closure for hygiene and disinfection, even if an infected person is found in schools and child facilities.
Where there is a minimum to medium community spread, social distancing policies can be adopted, such as suspending field trips, gatherings and physical education or other large gatherings, including in prayer classes or restaurants, increasing the distance between desks, changing times of arrival and departure, limiting unnecessary visitors, and setting up separate health centres for children with flu-like symptoms.
While there is significant infection in the local group, with social distancing strategies, schools may be considered to be closed for longer days. The CDC recommends that law enforcement personnel who perform routine day-to-day activities have an immediate health risk.
Law enforcement officers who are required to contact other persons who have been infected with COVID-19 or are susceptible to infection are recommended to follow the guidelines along with appropriate personal protective equipment like emergency medical technicians.
In case of close contact during the period of care, employees should clean and disinfect using household cleaning sprays or wipes before reuse of their duty belts and gears, and follow standard procedures for disposing of the PPE used as well as for the controlled period.
OSHA considers certain employees in healthcare and in the mortuary to be at high or high risk of infection.
High-risk activities include healthcare delivery, assistance, laboratory and medical transport staff who come in contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
If employees are performing aerosol-manufacturing procedures on known or suspected COVID-19 patients or collecting or handling samples from such patients, they are at high risk of infection.
Aerosol-manufacturing procedures include intubation, cuff induction process, bronchoscopy, some dental systems and examination or invasive sample collection.
The high risk of infection includes employees engaged in preparing the dead bodies of persons with known or suspected cases of COVID-19 at the time of death; if they do post-mortem, they are at high risk of infection. Additional engineering controls in these risk groups include isolation rooms for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including those undergoing aerosol manufacturing process.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some healthcare and bathroom designs.
The biosafety level should be handled with 3 processes.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be isolated in a separate waiting room if they are suspected of COVID-19. Along with other PPE, OSHA recommends that employees who are working within 6 feet from known or suspected cases of SARS-CoV-2 should be allowed to use respirators.
In the United States, NIOSH-accredited N95 respirators or better should be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protective system, including fitness-testing, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory preservatives can provide better protection and can be more comfortable for employees. WHO does not recommend protecting the entire body, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, it does not spread through other body secretions.
The WHO recommends the use of surgical masks only for entry-level screening.
WHO recommends using surgical masks, goggles or face coverings, gowns and gloves for staff who are collecting, caring or transporting respiratory samples of patients undergoing COVID-19 treatment without any aerosol-producing procedures.
If the aerosol-producing process is carried out, surgical masks should be used instead of N95 or FFP2 respirators.
Due to inadequate global supply of PPE, physical barriers such as telemedicine, clean windows, allowing direct access to healthcare providers in classrooms with COVID-19 patients by using the required PPE only for specific work, recommends reducing the need for the use of PPE by not providing them with face masks, and using a single respiratory mask without side-by-side while serving multiple patients diagnosed with PPE supplies.

We are in a very difficult situation this month.
COVID-19 is a global phenomenon that shows the interconnectedness of global humanity and our responsibilities towards each other.
We don't have previous examples of this challenge, but we know that our best response depends on global empathy, cooperation, and building a group at the heart of our organization.
The remarkable authentication of how lucky we are to have the opportunity to work with so many wonderful people is the goodwill and concern that all of our colleagues see from email, phone, and chat.
I can't be more grateful and proud to call you my friend.
Last week, I was praised for my work.
He reminded me of how important it is for the world to read Wikipedia right now, and how powerful it is to have this important tool online and available to everyone.
It's because of your work that you've been able to keep this site up-to-date, or pay our colleagues, or keep your group safe.
The world of information that Wikipedia provides is much more needed now than ever.
This is a moment in which not only what we do, but how we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
In the coming weeks, we will be making some significant changes in the importance of this campaign and how we work together because of your role in it.
Changes in our work and work schedules
As mentioned earlier by Robin, the C-Team met last night to discuss its approach and schedule in the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what response would be appropriate to the one we are facing and the best way to sustain the institution during this period.
We have a strong desire to relieve stress and help our campaign for the long term.
If you want to change it again, you don't want to change it.
For all employees, contractors and contractors:
Our daily work expectancy will be around 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We're not going to announce a holiday - if you can work more normal hours, you can use this campaign.
However, at the moment, the world cannot be predicted and whether you want to take care of your loved ones, bring groceries or go to a doctor, your health is our priority.
We are not taking your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
We don’t need to say that, but we do.
There's no need for sick leave or PTO - just tell your managers and help your team make adjustments to the calendar and schedule, so that important parts of the work can be taken care of.
(If you have been diagnosed with COVID-19, please tell Brian in T&C Ops, so that T&C can support you and take care of your situation with proper attention from the management).
Full pay will be given to the employees who work on the hour.
We have already said and reaffirmed our commitment to our contractors and hourly employees.
Everyone will be paid according to their normal working conditions.
If you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we will help you.
Many people use the work as a way to share the stress of the world around them.
Especially in times like these, what we do will be amazingly rewarding.
Again, it's about taking care of yourself.
We want you to communicate with your managers so that we know what to expect and we can make changes accordingly.
Some work is considered essential.
There are some things that we should continue to do.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust and Safety and Fundraising Teams (some of them) do important work, which may require additional help.
We will start the process with all the departments to evaluate the current objectives and focus on helping with the essentials of our mission.
There is a lot of work to be done for all of you, we will only focus on the most important projects.
If you work hard now, it will not break.
Once it went global, we didn't plan on "doubling time to complete the work."
You don't have to work an extra hour to get to work.
We accept that the situation has changed and we will work to set new goals and schedule when appropriate.
What is the Annual Plan (APP)?
While adjusting to your new realistic and daily working hours, our aim is to adjust the timeline for the delivery of your 2020-2021 annual plan.
Our aim is to propose to expand our 2019-2020 plan, allowing employees more time to prepare a budget to prioritize important tasks, self-care and care for their loved ones while incorporating those people, who need to work in the next few weeks or who want to work for a shorter period of time.
This extension of the deadline will greatly reduce the current planning workload and stress in the organization as a whole.
We will be submitting our proposals to the Board next week, and as we get confirmation of this, we will update our representatives and teams for further action.
Thank you to the AP for your support.
The status, infection and cleanliness of the office
Last week we learned that an employee in our SF-area is likely to have contracted the COVID-19 virus.
Nevertheless, with utmost caution, we have appointed an anti-viral hygiene team to disinfect all areas in San Francisco's offices.
They use high-quality antiviral solutions used in the hospital to disinfect every surface, as well as the lobby and the shores of the carrier that come to our floor.
This building adopts its own precautionary measures by using such products which help in the safety of its tenants.
We are happy that these offices will be fully ready to work when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in the WeWork area, where their COVID-19 solutions have been shared with us and with all other DC-area staff.
Last week, our DC office was transformed into a completely remote set-up in accordance with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in NYC-area know, we are discussing leasing to take a seat in Brooklyn.
We’re talking about this, but we can be in a hurry.
We are working remotely for the first time.
Long-time colleagues working remotely know that this will be just an adjustment, and they would like to give you some advice:
Limit the duration of your meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If you need long sessions, consider how they can be divided into several days.
Explain the agenda of the meeting clearly and send the materials in advance to them.
Make this video a default with tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate direct collaboration and connection.
To make each meeting easier, ask someone to lead her, who will monitor the chat for the questions asked, check the list of speakers, and ask someone else to help take notes (or take notes in cooperation with each other).
Send an email to the technical support if you need a headset.
Use your money to pay for the repairs.
Join the <0x23>Remotes channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about the assigned work.
The Human Resources Operations Team is looking at webinar-based algorithms to help the growth of the work that has been delivered throughout the organization.
Last week we asked all community grant recipients to postpone Wikimedia-subsidized public gatherings such as "Editathons" until the WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We told them that we have come to know that our request for stay and other restrictions will make it impossible for them to meet the agreed grant-in-aid mechanism, and also to say that no one will be punished for this delay and for changing that goal.
Next week, we will follow the additional guidance given for Wikimedia and other regional and topical community gatherings.
A common sense of the global community as a whole is both sad about this disruption, but also the clarity and the ability to focus on our own communities, Wikimedia and others.
While moving forward, CRT is working to establish a page on Meta-Wiki to monitor this impact and provide a space for the community to track our communication with them.
Keeping in touch with COVID-19 related issues.
We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and spend some time understanding each other.
We are all here to help as much as possible.

B'Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that attaches to the outer surface of cells in the lungs, blood vessels, heart, kidneys and intestines.
By reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing the amount of Ang(1-7), ACE2 opposes the action of the associated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and therefore it is a promising drug for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 acts as the entry point for some corona viruses to enter cells.
The human version of the enzyme is often called hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-metaloenzyme that is located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
ACE2 protein has an N-terminal peptides M2 domain and C-terminal colectarine renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single pass type of skin protein that is activated by its enzyme activity on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extra cell domain of ACE2 is broken down by another transammbrane called shadows, resulting in the diuretic protein being released into the blood and eventually dissolved in the bladder.
ACE2 is present in most organs: type II alveolar cells in the lungs, enterocytes in the small intestine, endothelial cells in the arteries and veins, and ACE2 is linked to the smooth muscle of most organs.
ACE2 mRNA is also found in cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as a resistance to ACE.
ACE angiotensin I allows the hormone to enter the vasoconstricting angiotensin II.
In turn, ACE2 breaks down carboxyl-terminal amino acids from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into vasodiolator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Hle-Hle-Ty-Val-Phe).
[des-Arg9]-Bradykinin, apeline, neurotensin, dynorphine A and many other peptides, including ghrelin, can burst ACE2.
Neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 also regulates the membrane transport of ACE2 and is involved in Hartnoop's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 acts as the main entry point in cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Interestingly, the binding of the enzyme domain of ACE2 on the surface of cells with SARS-CoV and the spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV2 results in endocytosis, and the transfer of both virus and enzymes to endosomes located in cells.
The admission process also requires the preamble of S protein by host serine protease TMPRSS2, which is being banned as a potential treatment in the current investigation. This has led some to conclude that lowering ACE2 levels in cells will help fight infection.
However, many professional organizations and regulatory bodies have recommended the continuation of standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control."
In addition, patients who were at higher risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure, were treated with ACE inhibitors.
Although the effects of ACE inhibitors are less strong than the overall risk of pneumonia, ACE use was also associated with reducing the mortality rate associated with pneumonia.
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is thought to be a novel therapy for acute lung injury and has shown to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, and it takes 30 minutes for the result to start and the result (period) is 24 hours.
Many findings show that RhACE2 can be a promising drug for those with chronic renal-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or intolerance in diseases with high-ranking angiotensis. RhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
B-COVID-19 apps are software applications in mobile, designed to help contact as a response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying the person ("contact") who is in contact with an infected person.
Numerous applications were developed and proposed with official government support in some provinces and jurisdictions.
A number of frameworks have been developed to create contact tracing apps.
In particular, concerns have been raised about privacy in such systems that track the geographical location of the app users.
Blue Tooth Signals are included in less-unusual options to log the contents of a user's phone with other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that such Bluetooth-based apps will be integrated into the functionality to support their Android and iOS operating systems directly.
The Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay in China, has launched an app to check whether citizens have come in contact with people who have been infected with COVID-19.
This app is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Trace Together is used in Singapore.
The app was developed by a local IT community and was made available as an open source and handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched a blue tooth-based app "Stop Corona" to contact potentially infected individuals and respond quickly to health care officials.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
The app was awaiting approval from Google Play Store and Apple App Store until April 14, 2020.
The government said on April 12, 2020, that the app is in an advanced stage of development and will be available in a few weeks. A similar app is available in Ireland and in France ("Stop Covid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering an app based on Singapore's Trace Together and Blue Tooth Protocol. Russia intends to introduce a geofencing app designed to ensure that they do not leave home for COVID-19 infected patients living in Moscow.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, listed a number of potential practical difficulties in app-based systems, including the inaccuracy of positive and low probability of effectiveness if the use of the app is limited to only a small fraction of the population.
While expressing concern about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple set limits on what types of organizations can add apps related to the coronavirus to their App Store, limiting them to "authorized" or otherwise reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy campaigners expressed strong concern over the impact of mass surveillance using the coronavirus apps, especially about whether the infrastructure for surveillance prepared to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be destroyed.
Amnesty International and 100 other organisations have called for restrictions on such surveillance in a statement.
The Institute has issued eight conditions for government projects:
The surveillance must be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
Sunset clauses will have to be for the extension of surveillance and surveillance;
The use of data should be limited to the causes of COVID-19;
Information security and anonymity have to be protected and shown to be protected on the basis of supply;
It is necessary to avoid intense discrimination and neglect due to digital surveillance;
The sharing of information with third parties should be defined in the Act;
The right of citizens to protect against abuse and to respond to abuse;
A meaningful participation of all “related stakeholders” with public health experts and neglected groups is required. Checklists have also been issued by the German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporters on Grenzen) (RSF).
Once the need for a tracking system is over, the proposed Google/Apple plan aims to address the problem of surveillance by permanently removing it from their device operating system.
Some countries use network-based location tracking instead of apps in which the need to download apps eliminates both things.
Network-based tracking has been approved in Israel.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have significant potential privacy issues.
However, all systems with intermediate servers do not need to access personal location data; many privacy protected systems have been created that only use intermediate servers for intercommunication.
In South Korea, a system was used to present contact tracing that was not based on the app.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected various tracking information, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and also collected potentially-infected persons to generate notices through text messages.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has made public the location information, something that was allowed, due to far-reaching changes in the Information Privacy Act, following the outbreak of MERS in that country.
This information is available to the public through numerous apps and websites. Other countries, including Germany, considered both centralized and privacy-protected systems.
Details have not been released as of April 6, 2020.
Privacy – Protected Contact Tracing is a well-established concept, with research materials from at least 2013. As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly measures, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to log in with other cell phones connected to the user.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinating effort with both centralized and decentralized methods and not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include Decentralized Privacy – Finding Proximity (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Protocols, and Mobile Contact Tracking mechanisms for CEN.
The personal data that is identifiable in these protocols will never leave the device and all the matches are on the device.
MIT Media Lab's Privacy Group is developing SafePath, a platform to use privacy-protected technologies while collecting or using location or path-breaking points to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on the research of the White Paper "Apps Gone Rouge: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. Another similar effort is SafeTrace, a company developed by Enigma MPC, which was originally established in the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace allows users, without compromising the privacy of that data, to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities.
On April 5, 2020, the Global TCN Alliance was founded by groups that had originally come together around a similar approach and mainly overlapping protocols, and their aim was to enable the efficiency of fragmentation, solicitation and alerting apps, which is a key aspect of wider engagement.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had made the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government app open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracing based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy Technologies and privacy cryptography, which they claim will maintain privacy.
He also highlighted the features of the original technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system can be implemented in three phases:
To protect the roll out - out - coronavirus tracing apps of tools to enable governments to create government secrecy.
This functionality is directly integrated into iOS, Android Google, and Apple first by distributing the system via operating system updates and removing it again in the same way after the threat is overcome.
B. Drug repositioning (also known as drug repurposing, re-profiling, retasking, or therapeutic switching) is the use of a drug originally approved for the treatment of a disease or another disease.
This is the same kind of scientific research that is currently being done to develop safe and quality treatments for COVID-19.
Plasma Infections for Vaccines and Rehabilitation. SARS-CoV-2 has 66 dragable proteins each with several associated binding locations.
An analysis of such binding locations provides an appropriate scope for the manufacture of a potent anti-viral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papain-like proteins, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphate.
Hussain A.A. and others studied various candidate compounds followed by similarity in its nature with recognized drug which in their preclinical studies could be recommended in the clinical study plan by developing anti-SARS-CoV-2 anti-viral drug.
Chloroquine is an anti-fungal drug that is used to treat certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that the four drugs to be studied as part of a Solidarity clinical trial would include chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State tests on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will be conducted from March 24. On March 28, the FDA granted the authority to use hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The FDA has not received approval for these treatments through a clinical trial process and is empowered under the EUA for experimental treatment only for patients who have been admitted to the hospital but cannot receive treatment under a clinical trial.
According to the CDC, the use, volume, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection has not yet been certified.
Doctors have been told that this drug is used when "no other option is left."
A small study was conducted by the Turkish research team in Istanbul, using chloroquine with zinc, non-lifestyle, vitamin D and vitamin D.
A large number of studies are being conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The safety and quality of hydroxychloroquine is being tested by NYU Longon Medical School as a preventive measure.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have claimed that Favipiravir is "completely effective."
If 35 patients tested negative in Shenzhen in 4 days, the duration of the disease of 45 patients who did not receive it was 11 days.
In a study of 240 patients with pneumonia in Wuhan, half of the patients were given Favipivir and half of the patients received Umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminds people that the existing quantity in support of the drug is inadequate and primary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy from Japan to stock up on the drug, and distribute it to university hospitals with the help of the army, where the drug will be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to a South China Morning Post report, Shinzo Abe held a formal meeting with the Trump administration on the purchase of the drug, which may be less effective in patients with severe illness because the virus has already multiplied there.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or women who are trying to conceive.
A study on Lopinavir/Retonavir (Caletra) in which anti-viral Lopinavir and Ritonavir were combined, concluded that "no benefit was found"
The drug was developed to prevent the formation of HIV replicas by binding with protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado has been working on improving these drugs to find compounds that bind with the proteins of SARS-CoV-2.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has included Lopinavir/Retonavir in the Solidarity Test.
Remdesivir was developed and developed by Gilead Sciences to treat Ebola virus infection and Marburg virus infection. Giled Sciences then discovered that Remdesivir showed phylo-, pneumo-, paramyxo-, and anti-coronavirus intravenous viral activity.
One of the problems in antiviral treatment is the resistance from mutations that result in more serious diseases and infections.
Some earlier test pre-requisites suggest that Remdesivir may have high gene resistance. Some clinical trials are ongoing, with two being conducted at Cleveland University Hospital; one for people with mild illness and another for people with severe illness.
There are three clinical trials underway for sterilization of patients with severe COVID-19 and hospitalization; two controlled placebos (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The New York state began testing azithromycin on March 24.
Japan's National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) has planned to conduct a clinical trial of corticosteroids taken inhaled by Tijin for the first time to treat patients with nowell coronavirus.

The role of colchusin in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19 is currently being studied by researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada.
About 6,000 adults aged 40 and above are being recruited for the study, who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and do not need to be hospitalized.
Pregnant or lactating mothers as well as women who are not following the effective contraceptive method are not eligible.
Various tests are being conducted in Italy.
Heparin with a low molecular weight is being used to treat patients, which encourages medical institutions in Italy to publish guidelines.
A multi-disciplinary study of 300 patients was announced by Italy on April 14 to research the immunocompromised and curative amounts of anoxaparin sodium.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientifically more attention is being paid to the use of antiviral drugs that were previously approved in combination with MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus for new purposes.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for treatment of COVID-19 as per the 7th edition of China's guidelines.
Yumifenovir: Yumifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of China's guidelines.
Some antibiotics were discovered to be useful for the new purpose of treatment for COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (IL-6-anti-receptor): Approved by China
See also tests in China and Italy and Tocilizumab <0x23>COVID19.
The B'A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical anti-coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine.
Despite the fact that no clinical trials of any vaccine have been completed, several efforts are underway to develop such a vaccine.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said in late February that the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is not expected to be available before 18 months.
In April, Phase I security studies were conducted on five vaccine candidates.

As announced in April, the CEPI initiative has the imperatives of speed, manufacturing capacity, scale planning and global reach to develop the vaccine.
In April, CEPI scientists were informed that research and development was underway on 10 different technology platforms in early 2020 to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main objectives of Phase I security studies are:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I Developer and Vaccine Candidate: Moderna, MRNA-1273)
Viral Vector (Phase I Developer and Vaccine Candidate: CanSino Biologics, Adenovirus Type 5 Vector)
According to CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the pre-developed stage of development, out of which 78 projects have been confirmed (as per the Milken Institute 79), and another 37 have been announced, with very little information being made public (assuming the project is being planned or planned).
Phase I-II trials have carried out a preliminary examination of safety and antigen ability and are usually randomized, placebo controlled and in multiple locations to determine the exact, qualitative quantity.
Phase III trials usually have more participants, including a controlled group, and the vaccine's quality is checked to prevent the disease, as well as monitoring for side effects after adequate doses are given.
Out of 79 active vaccines (as confirmed in early April 2020), 74 vaccines have not been evaluated in humans (more "preclinical" research is underway).
On January 24, 2020, at Australia, the University of Queensland announced that potential molecular clamps were exploring a vaccine that would induce an immune response by genetic improvement in the proteins of the virus.

In March 2020, the United Nations government, industry, and three universities combined with Hewlett Packard Enterprise's Cloud Computing Resources, Amazon, Microsoft and Google to access IBM's supercomputer.
Some vaccines have an adverse effect, which can also be said to have unintended consequences.
This means that in addition to preventing the disease, other benefits can also be derived from it.
A total of 4,170 healthcare workers will be recruited for a randomized trial in Australia.
The vaccine being developed is unlikely to be safe or effective.
Previous research conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the vaccine on specific animals such as ACE2-transgenic rats, other laboratory animals, and other primates, except humans, suggests the need for an international coordination to ensure biosafety-level 3 controller measures and standardized safety procedures for handling the live virus.
Anti-SARS and MERS vaccines have been tested on animals other than humans.
As of 2020, there is no SARS vaccine or both safe and effective vaccine for humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, finding and developing novel vaccines and drugs to treat SARS was a priority task for governments and public health organizations around the world. There is also no standard vaccine for MERS.
When MERS became more dominant, it was believed that the ongoing research on SARS would provide a useful model for finding vaccines and medicines for MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, Phase I clinical trial of one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine had been completed in humans, and three other vaccines were in operation, all of which were viral-vectored vaccines, two adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BFRS-GAMVAK), and one MVA-Victored (MVA-V).
The post on social media has triggered a discussion about the virus that was responsible for COVID-19 and the vaccine is already available.
The patents, which have come as evidence from various posts on social media, refer to the genetic sequence of the coronavirus and the patent for the vaccine.
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2.
Common symptoms are fever, cough and difficulty in breathing.
Other symptoms include fatigue, muscle aches, diarrhoea, sore throat, lack of smell, and stomach ache.
The duration of symptoms is usually five days, but can range from two to 14 days.
The majority of patients have mild symptoms, while some patients experience an increase in the disease resulting in viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As on 17th April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported from 210 countries and territories, of which 153,000 died.
More than 5,68,000 patients have recovered from the disease. The virus is spread mainly through direct contact among people, often through coughing, sneezing or sneezing.
When inhaled, these tissues are thrown out and fall to the ground or to the surface, they do not carry infection at very long distances.
People can also get infected by touching eyes, nose and mouth by touching contaminated surfaces.
The virus survives on any surface for 72 hours.
The first three days after the onset of symptoms are highly contagious, but it can also be spread in stages before and after symptoms appear. The real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) of the Nasagrassi solution is a standard method of diagnosis.
Those who are suspected to have contracted the virus and those who serve them are advised to wear masks.
The general public is advised to use masks, some authorities oppose the use of masks, while some advise the use of them, and some say it is necessary.
There is currently no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine for COVID-19.
The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that most of the countries in all six regions have contracted the disease.
Patients who are infected with the virus sometimes do not show symptoms or have flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and difficulty breathing.
Sudden symptoms include difficulty in breathing, constant pain or stress in the chest, feeling confused, difficulty walking, and blue eyes; it is advisable to go to the hospital immediately if these symptoms occur.
Mild symptoms may include respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, nasal sneezing, or sore throat.
In some patients, symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were found to be less frequent.
Some patients in China initially had symptoms of chest congestion and heartburn.
Some patients reported increased cases of pneumonia, multiple organ failure and death.
This is called incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but in some people it can be two to 14 days.
In 97.5 percent of patients who developed symptoms, it was seen in 11.5 days after infection. Reports show that symptoms do not develop in all patients who have been infected.
The role of these non-symptomatic carriers in infection is not yet clear; however, they are said to be involved in the spread of the disease from an early stage.
While the number of infected patients who do not have symptoms is not yet known and studies are underway, 20% of those confirmed by the Coria Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that they did not have symptoms until they were in the hospital.
China's National Health Commission began incorporating non-symptoms into daily patients from April 1; out of the 166 infected patients that day, 130 (78%) had no symptoms at the time of testing.
Red and white are both very important.
It's more common to speak out than to speak out.
According to a study conducted in Singapore, non-covering of the mouth can cause the tussle to go up to 4.5 metres (15 feet) away.
Although the virus does not originate from the air, the National Academy of Sciences has predicted bioerosol transmission and a positive virus RNA has been found in samples taken from gas collectors located outside people's homes.
Some medical procedures, such as ducts in the body and heart as well as reactivation of blood vessels, can cause discharges through the respiratory tract and thus spread through the air.
When there is a concern about the spread of the virus, the risk is considered low. People with symptoms are most susceptible to the virus; moreover.
According to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), although it is not yet fully clear how easily the disease spreads, the virus can infect two to three people from one person. The virus survives on surfaces for several hours to a few days.
The virus has been found on paper cartons for one day, on plastic and steel surfaces (AISI 304), for three days and on 99% copper surfaces for four hours.
However, it depends on the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere and changes accordingly.
If soaps and detergents are used properly, they can be effective for this; soap products degrade the thick protective layer of the virus, neutralize it and separate it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other measures, such as benzaconium chloride and chlorexidine gluconate (a sterile for a type of surgery) are less effective. In one study conducted in Hong Kong, red samples were taken two days after they were admitted to the hospital.
Five of the six patients, the highest number of patients were detected in the first sample and the highest number of patients were tested on the second day.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new acute respiratory symptom coronavirus that was first isolated from three pneumonia patients associated with the acute respiratory illness center in Wuhan.
All the features of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are visible in nature-related coronaviruses.
Outside of the human body, the virus is killed by household soaps that make up our protected bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV virus.
COVID-19 has the most impact on the lungs, as the virus reaches the original cells through the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is abundant in the second type of atmospheric cells in the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a spike to bind to ACE2 and enter the original cells.
Heart attacks have also been reported in 12 per cent of patients admitted to hospitals in China, Wuhan, and have been found to be frequent in severe illness.
The symptoms of acute heart injury are largely due to the inflammatory response of the body system during the spread of the disease and the loss of immunity, but the acute injury of the heart muscle may also be related to factors that receive ACE2 in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are abundant in the heart and are involved in heart function.
Examples of blood clotting (31 per cent) and blood clotting (25 per cent) have been found in severe COVID-19 patients. They are probably related to unsystematic pathologies. Their lungs have been detected by post-mortem of patients who died from COVID-19. Diffuse alvelor dames have also been found to be stained in the lungs.
Although SARS-CoVID-2 has a tendency to infect cells with respirator-mediated cells for ACE2, severe COVID-19 patients have symptoms of hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was found that inflammatory IL-6-drug monocytes were associated with the appointment and acute pulmonary disease among COVID-19 patients with pathogenic GM-CSF-drug T-Pashi.
An intrusion of white cells was also seen from the post-mortem.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has published a number of guidelines for testing the disease.
Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction is a recognized method of testing.
The respiratory tract samples obtained by the throat swabs are usually tested; but the discharge or spitting samples in the respiratory tract can also be used for this.
Test results are usually available within a few hours or two days.
Blood tests can be done, but this requires two samples of blood done at a gap of two weeks and its results are immediately valued.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate the coronavirus and publish its genetic sequences, allowing laboratories around the world to independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests that identify the virus.
Antibiotic tests (which can diagnose current infections and also tell if a person had previously been infected) were developing as of April 4, 2020, but were not widely used.
China's testing experience says that its accuracy is only 60 to 70 percent.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care test to be used at the end of that month on March 21, 2020. Diagnosis guidelines issued by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggest methods for identifying infections based on chemical characteristics and risk of disease conditions.
Bilateral multilobber ground-glass obscurity with peritoneal, asymmetric and background distribution in the initial contagion was a common matter.
As the disease progresses, it is possible that subplural dominance, bizarre pavement (lobulary septal thickening with variable alveolar fillings) and concentration may occur.
There is little information available about the physiology and micro-injury of COVID-19.
Some of the important aspects related to the pathogens found in the post-mortem are:
Things that can be seen by the eyes: pulmonary cover, chest pain, strengthening of the lungs and swelling of the lungs.
There are four types of Pneumonia:
Mild pneumonia: swelling of the lungs, excessive pulmonary cells, uncombined large cells in the lungs, interstitial inflammation of white cells, and the formation of multifaceted large cells.
Acute Pneumonia: the removal of the lungs and the uncontrolled release of the lungs
Diffuse alveler damage is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (Acute Respiratory Disorder Syndrome) and acute oxygen deficiency.
Recoverable Pneumonia: Collecting uncontrolled secretions in the pulmonary cavity and interstitial fibrosis in the lungs
Blood: Decommissioned intravascular coagulation of the arteries; leukorthyroblastic reaction
Measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water frequently and for at least 20 seconds, keeping the respiratory tract clean, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends holding a handkerchief in front of the nose and mouth while coughing or sneezing. If there is no handkerchief, cover the nose with a handpiece.
Hands should be cleaned after any kind of cough or sneezing.
The CDC recommends wearing face coverings in public places to limit the spread of infection by people who do not have symptoms. Social distancing is aimed at reducing exposure to large gatherings of infected people. That is why schools, offices, travel restrictions and mass gatherings have been banned.
People are advised to maintain a distance of at least 6 feet from each other.
It is not yet known whether the vaccine will be effective against COVID-19, but it is not expected to arrive as early as 2021, so at present, a key part of the management of COVID-19 is to get the disease under control.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when their hands appear to be damaged, before eating and after coughing or sneezing.
Further, the CDC recommends that hand sanitizers containing alcohol content of at least 60% alcohol should be used only when soap and water are not available. In areas where commercial products of hand sanitizer are not available, the World Health Organization has provided two formulations for local production.
Antibiotics in these formulations are produced from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to prevent the growth of microorganisms in alcohol; it is not an “active substance for hand disinfection.”
Glycerol has been included as a moisture-retaining ingredient.
The patients are managed through supportive care, which includes providing oxygen, fluid treatment and supporting other vital organs.
The CDC recommends that those who are suspected to be carriers of the virus wear a simple face mask.
The treatment of the problem of respiratory failure has been used to provide oxygen from outside, but it is yet to be realised what are its benefits.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet have been suggested to boost immunity.
Supportive treatment can be used in those who have mild symptoms at an early stage of infection. The World Health Organization and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for taking care of COVID-19 patients who have been hospitalized.
Critical patient and pulmonary disease experts in the U.S. have combined the recommendations of various agencies to provide IBCC under a single open source.
As of April 2020, no specific treatment for COVID-19 has been determined.
Some medical professionals suggest the use of paracetamol initially instead of ibuprofen.
Precautions should be taken to minimise the risk of spread of the virus, especially in the process of spraying of in the air, such as ducts in the body or hand ventilation, while using medical facilities.
The CDC recommends general precautions for health workers who are caring for COVID-19 patients, contact tracing and airborne transmission, as well as keeping such patients in the Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR).
Recommended preventive equipment for preparedness: PPE gloves, respirators or facemasks, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, preference should be given to respirators instead of facemasks.
N95 respirators have been approved for industrial use, but the FDA has also approved the use of masks under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles such as dust in the air but, in other uses, its effect cannot be guaranteed for a particular biological medium.
When masks are not available, homemade masks can also be used as a face covering or as a last resort as per the CDC's recommendation.
The vast majority of COVID-19 patients are not as severe as those requiring medical ventilation or some alternatives, but a few percent of them are patients.
The type of medical respirator being provided to patients due to obstructions in the respiratory tract due to COVID-19 is continuously being studied for people in the hospital. The procedure of ducts in the body can be avoided through high-passage ducts or bilewell-positive airway pressure passing through the nose.
It is not yet known whether these two are of the same benefit to patients who are seriously ill.
Some doctors prefer invasive mechanical ventilation treatments if available, as this technique limits the spread of airborne pathogens compared to inhalation tubes. The incidence of the disease is much higher in older people (in those over 60 years of age, especially those over 80 years of age).
Even in many developed countries, there are not enough hospital beds per capita. This may limit the health system's ability to handle the question of hospitalization if the number of severe COVID-19 cases increases suddenly.
A study in China showed that 5 percent of the total patients were admitted to the ICU, 2.3 percent of the patients needed technical support for ventilation, and 1.4 percent died.
About 30% of COVID-19 patients admitted to hospitals in China had to be eventually admitted to the ICU department.
Due to the development of acute respiratory problems (ARDS) in COVID-19 patients, technical ventilation becomes more complex and it becomes more and more difficult to deliver oxygen.
When pressure-controlled ventilators and high PEEPs are supplied with oxygen, it is necessary to reduce the risk of pulmonary injury caused by ventilators as well as pneumothorax.
High-capacity PEEPs may not be available on older ventilators.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020 and many anti-viral drugs are going through trials thereafter.
Remdesivir seems to be the most reliable.
Although it will take until 2021 to develop new drugs, many of the tested drugs have been approved for other uses or are going through further trials.
Antiviral drugs can be tested on critically ill patients.
Volunteers recommended by the World Health Organization take part in trials to study the impact and safety of these potential treatments. The FDA has temporarily approved the treatment of convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment for patients whose lives are at risk.
They have not gone through the chemical studies to determine if they are effective and safe treatment for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
This app can show 'near contact' from the monitored information and can help to understand the potential for infection.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
The app suggests self-isolation if possible. Not only that, it also provides information to local health authorities. Big data analytics on cellphone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are all being used in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore to monitor infected patients and their contacts.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed the security departments to check the data on mobile phones of people who were suspected of being infected with the coronavirus.
Measures were taken to impose quarantine and protect those who could come in contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom handed over the collected data to the German Federal Government Agency, the Robert Koch Institute, which will be used to control the spread of the virus.
Russia has established a face recognition technology to detect people who break the quarantine.
Italy's regional health commissioner Julio Galari said he was receiving information via a mobile phone.
The German government held a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 partners.
Meanwhile, Estonian President Karti Karloulaid has called for a global challenge to find concrete solutions to the spread of the coronavirus.
People may find it distressing due to isolation, travel restrictions, adverse effects of treatment or fear of being infected.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying that "increased social isolation, loneliness, health care, stress and economic decline are the root causes that threaten people's mental health and well-being."
These diseases may have little or no symptoms at all, which are typical of other respiratory diseases such as colds and coughs.
Although mild cases usually recover within two weeks, it can take three to six weeks for a serious illness to recover.
Based on information from other similar viruses like SARS, MERS, it can be said that pregnant women who have been severely infected with COVID-19 may be at higher risk, but there is no information available about COVID-19. COVID-19 can affect the lungs in some people, leading to pneumonia.
COVID-19 can develop Acute Respiratory Disorders (ARDS) in people who are severely affected, which can result in respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure, etc.
The complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clots and heart, kidney and liver damage, etc.
6% of people admitted to the hospital due to COVID-19 have noticed an increase in blood clotting, prothrombin duration, and 4% of those in this group have been found to have kidney function disorder.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have been found to have high liver enzymes.
The same report states that the period between the appearance and death of the symptoms of the disease was ten days, of which 5 days were to be admitted in the hospital.
However, the patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit had to be admitted to the hospital and the period between their death was seven days.
Early case studies found that the average duration of death from the initial symptoms of the disease was 14 days.
A study by China's National Health Commission (NHC) found that men had a mortality rate of 2.8%, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological tests of post-mortum pulmonary samples show diffuse alveolar damage along with both pulmonary cell fibromyalgia.
There has been a change in cytoplasm.
The pulmonary artery was associated with Acute Respiratory Disorder Syndrome (ARDS).
Among the deaths reported by China's National Health Commission, 11.8% showed high levels of troponin or heart failure.
According to the U.S. March report, 89% of people admitted to the hospital already had some complaints. The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic status of the region also affected the death toll.
Regional distances change the death rate in this situation, but also due to the difficulties of the method.
Reducing the number of mild cases can lead to higher mortality rates.
However, the fact that these deaths are the result of contact cases in the past may mean that the current mortality rate has been reduced.
People who smoke are 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 than those who do not smoke, and approximately 2.4 times more likely to need supervision or die.
Hong Kong hospital authorities found a 20% - 30% decrease in the lung capacity of some people who had recovered from the disease, and a lung scan showed organ damage.
This is likely to lead to post-intensive care syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether previous infections provided effective and long-term immunity in people who recovered from the disease.
Based on other coronavirus transactions, it can be said that immunity is likely to appear, but there are cases in which a positive test of coronavirus has been reported in the next few days after recovering from COVID-19.
It is believed that such cases can lead to long-term infection rather than re-infection.
The virus is considered to be natural and its origin is believed to be an animal and its spread is caused by infection.
Its origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was entirely due to human-to-human transmission.
A study of 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January in The Lancet, showed that December 1, 2019 was the earliest date for symptoms to appear.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has listed the symptoms as early as December 8, 2019.
Various measures are generally adopted to calculate the death toll.
These numbers vary from region to region and from time to time and are affected by population characteristics such as the number of tests, quality of health care system, treatment options, the period from the initial outbreak and age, gender and overall health.
The WHO has provided an emergency ICD-10 code of U07.1 for confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection in the last quarter of 2019 and confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection in a laboratory that is clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed with COVID-19 during a post-death period. The number of deaths from COVID-19 is U07.1.
According to Johns Hopkins University, the global death-to-case ratio is 6.9%.
Other measures include the Case Mortality Rate (CFR), which displays the percentage of people diagnosed, who die from an illness, and the 'Infectious Mortality Rate (IFR), which displays the percentage of infected person (s) who died from an illness.
These figures do not have a time constraint and adopt a specific population infected through that case version.
While not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may indicate how many people have been infected.
In the center of the outbreak in Italy, 4,600,80 (1.7%) people have died so far in a small village called Castigilion the Adda.
The disease spread through the Carnival Festival in Gengelt and spread among young people, which had a comparatively low mortality rate, and perhaps not all COVID-19-infected deaths could be formally classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system is not so much a burden.
About 3% of people in the Netherlands may have antibodies, as reported by a blood donor.
69 (0.004% of the population) people have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of this pandemic and the mortality rate are different for men and women.
Studies conducted in China and Italy found that men have higher mortality rates.
Men in their 50s are at the highest risk, with the lowest mortality rates among men and women in the 90s.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The exact cause of these gender differences is not known, but it can be genetic and behavioral.
Differences in gender-based immunity, lower prevalence of smoking in women and co-morbidities such as high blood pressure in men at a younger age compared to women, may be the reason for all men to have higher mortality rates.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men, and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government had not been able to detect gender gaps in people infected with COVID-19.
Research has found that viral diseases like Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women in different ways.
A large number of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are at a higher risk of contracting the virus.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease would be COVID-19.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that CO means corona, VI means virus, D means disease, and 19 is the year when the first outbreak of the disease hit the target: December 31, 2019.
The name was given as a way to avoid referring to a specific geographical location (such as, China), animal species, or group of people, which was in line with the international recommendation for naming, and was intended to avoid stigmatizing anyone. The virus, which causes COVID-19, is named Caviar Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In addition to this, WHO uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communication.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as the "coronavirus."
At the time of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were both commonly referred to as the "Coronavirus" and the "Wuhan Coronavirus."
In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV Acute Respiratory Diseases as interim names for the virus and disease, following the 2015 guidance against using the site in the name of the disease and the virus.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to the capacity constraints in the standard inadequate range, some digital manufacturers are printing health care materials as nail swabs and ventilator parts.
For example, when a ventilator was urgently needed in a hospital in Italy and the supplier was unable to meet its timely supply, a local startup company carried out reverse-engineering and printed 100 volts at night.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, cut-off, false and distorted information about the origins, dimensions, treatment and other cases of the disease was generated and spread rapidly online.
Humans have been able to spread the virus to other animals.
The study failed to find evidence that the virus was replicated in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medication or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of this disease.
The government is carrying out international research on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines.
In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a "solidity trial" to assess the treatment effects of four of the most effective antiviral compounds.
There is no vaccine available at present, but various agencies are actively preparing 'less candidates'.
Previous studies on SARS-CoV-2 have been used, as both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 nerve cells to enter human cells.
So far, three vaccines have been developed.
First, the researchers aim to produce a complete virus vaccine.
The purpose of the use of such a virus, whether it is inactivated or dead virus, is to generate a new infection with COVID-19 in the immediate response of the human body.
Another strategy is the sub-unit vaccine, which aims to produce a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to a certain sub-unit of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on S-spice proteins that help the virus distinguish the ACE2 enzyme nervous system.
A third strategy is about the nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, an innovative technology to produce vaccines).
All the three strategies require testing for the safety and efficacy of the experimental vaccine. On 16th March, 2020, a clinical trial of one vaccine along with four volunteers was started in Seattle.
The vaccine has a risk-free genetic code, a replica of which is derived from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent enhancement has been suggested as a potential challenge to develop a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active medical tests are being conducted.
Seven tests were being evaluated from treatments already approved for malaria, including four researches on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Most Chinese searches include multi-purpose antiviral drugs, with nine trials on stage-III occurring on remdesivir in many countries, according to a report submitted at the end of April.
As of April 2020, there is a dynamic review of the medical development for COVID-19 vaccines and drug candidates. Several existing antiviral drugs have been evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/Rytonavir/Rytonavir with interferon beta.
According to a March 2020 report, provisional evidence is present for the effect by remdesivir.
Medical improvement was observed in patients treated with remdesivir.
Phase-III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine, which was previously used for malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there is a need for a comprehensive review of this research.
Korean and Chinese health officials have recommended the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending its one gram dose per day, noted that its double dose was very dangerous and could even lead to death.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorizations for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine based on the discretion of doctors treating COVID-19. The Chinese Seventh Edition guide also includes interferon, raibavirin or Yumifenovhir for use against COVID-19.
Primary data suggests that high doses of raibavirin are needed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 in the test.
Nitazoxanaide has been recommended for further testing after exposure to low-concentration restriction of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is the primary protein required for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) through interaction with the ACE-2 technique.
With or without azithromycin, there are major problems in studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine that prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir did not prevent SARS-CoV-2 in experiments and found no known role in its treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine storms can become more complicated in the next stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine tarmac properties. Tocilizumab has been included in the treatment guide by the National Health Commission of China after a short study.
In Italy, non-random trials of Phase 2 are underway at the national level after seeing positive results in people with severe illness.
Combining serum ferritin with blood test to identify cytokine storms, it would mean resisting such development, which has been considered to be the cause of death in some infected people.
In 2017, the FDA approved interleukin-6 neurotransmitters based on a retrospective study on the treatment of CAR T cell treatment, a different cause of the targeted steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome.
Currently, there is no random, controlled evidence that Tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Research is underway as a non-communicable method of inactivated immunization of the transfer of refined and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of people who have recovered from COVID-19.
This strategy was used for SARS, but it did not yield any special results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action, by which passive antibodies can be treated against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody treatment are under development, for example, using built-in monoclonal antibodies.
The production of qvalcent serums, which contain fluid proteins in the blood of cured patients, and which contain antibodies that are specific to this virus, can be extended for rapid development.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, was infected with COVID-19 and died after raising awareness of the spread of the virus.
