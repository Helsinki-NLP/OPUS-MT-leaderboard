It's a kind of cat.
It's an exciting city, New York.
It's a shame you can't travel with us.
It's a shame you can't join us.
It's a privilege to meet you.
It's better to take your time than to hurry and make mistakes.
It's clear that he's at home.
It's Friday.
It's getting bigger.
It's getting dark out.
It's getting dark outside.

It's become very hard for me to walk very far.
It's been ages since we last met.
It's been a while since I've told you that I love you.

It won't stay that way.
It won't stay this way.
It will ruin us all.
It will shortly be any easier on the people if the cudge that they are beaten is called the people's cudge.
It'll take me 20 minutes to get to the station by taxi.
