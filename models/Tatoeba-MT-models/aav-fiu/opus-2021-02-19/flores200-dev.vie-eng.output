Stars produce light and heat because energy is produced when hydrogen anesthetic units (or body units) create more elements.
Scientists are researching to create a reactor that can create energy in this way.
However, this is a very difficult problem, and it will take years to see the effective nuclear power plants being built.
The steel flows on the water because of the surface pressure.
The surface pressure occurs because the gravity between the water molecules on the surface is larger than the gravity of gas molecules above them.
The molecules produce the invisible skin on the surface of the water allowing things like the needle that can float on the water.
The knife of the modern ice shoes is the blade and there's a farming line in the middle.
Because of the lower knife grows lightly, when the knife goes towards one side or another, the side of contact with the ice also bends.

To return to the initial energy level, they have to remove the extra energy that they can load from the light.
They do this by launching small light particles called "photon".
Scientists call this process "special radiation" because the atomic particles are stimulated by light, creating the radiation of the photon particles, and the light is a kind of radiation.
The next drawing shows that the nuclear is launching the photons, of course, in fact the photon is much smaller than the image.
The photon level is even smaller than the atomic formation!
After hundreds of hours of light, the bulb bulb was finally burned and the bulb was unleashed.
