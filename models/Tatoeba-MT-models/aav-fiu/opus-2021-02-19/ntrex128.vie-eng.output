Congressman Wales (AM) worrys about ‘ looking like puppets'
There are a certain congressman’s specific concerns about changing their nickname to MWP (Wales Senate's Senate Guard).
It's a big problem because of plans to change the Congress's name to the Wales Congress.
Congressmen on the nervous council may be a matter of debate.
A Lao delegation said that his party was worried that "the word would spell with Twp and Pwp."
For non - Walesian readers: In Wales, twp means twp of decay.
A deputy Party deputy pointed out that the whole party was "no proud" and proposed other names.
And a conservative delegator shared his party with no prejudice about changing his name, but not forgotten to mention the MWP shortcuts that were easy to turn into Moppet.
In the meantime the w of the Wales is pronounced similarly as the New Yorkshire U.S.U.
The Congress Committee is currently arranging the bill of removal, which states: "The final decision on any recognition of the Congressmen's names, of course, is to be concerned for its own delegates."
The Government Act in 2017 gave the right to the Wales Congress to be renamed.
In June, the Committee announced the results of a civil proposition to find a contract facilities for calling the Congress of the Wales Senate.
In view of the title story of Congressmen, the Committee of Congressman Wales or WMP, but the outcome of the proposal shows the council of the Senate of Wales.
Congressmen are publicly making other options, but the effort to achieve unity may be the concern of the Chief of the election, Elin Jones, who is assigned to present the reform bill for the next few weeks.
The modifier plan will include other changes in how the Congressman operates, including rules of the Congressmanship and the design of governmental machines.
Congressmen will give the final vote to the question what they should be changed when they contributed to the reform bill.
The people of Macedonia vote in the public pronoun about changing the name of the country.
The voters vote on Sunday about whether they have changed their national names into "The North Macedonian Peace."
The full vote was established in an effort to resolve the decade with the neighbors of Greece, where there was also a province called Macedonia.
Athén has long established that the name of the northern neighborhood corresponds to his own territory and has repeatedly opposed to becoming a member of the EU and NATO of your country.
President Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov, a member of the rebel party in exchange of national names, has declared to resign the vote.
However, participants, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claimed that change of nationality was the price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The Church of St. Martin wandered to shut up when the Terror happened in Harlem
"Shaking in history, the older men I've been exposed to share that every corner of the street have a bar and a church," said Mr. Adams.
"Until today, there's no church and there's no bar."
He found that disappearing of bars is acceptable.
He said, "Man has many ways to deliver."
"The bars are no longer public living rooms where people come back often."
As for the churches, he's worried that the money from selling property won't last as much as the leaders expected, and sooner or later, it'll all be back at the start line."
He adds that these churches can be replaced by residential buildings with many of the decade's apartments, which will not help to maintain local respect.
He shared, "A little part of the people who bought the apartments in these buildings would be white people, and then imagined the church closed would come faster than ever, because there's no reason that the inhabitants of those apartments would become churches here."
Both churches were built by white councils before Harlem became a city of black people -- the Metropolitan Community in the 1870 ’ s, became St. Martin's a decade later.
The first white theologians moved away in the 1930s.
A nearby skin cultural church took over the location.
St. Martin's has been taken by a black crew under the management of the priest John Howard Johnson, who's head of a slummers on the 125th Street, a shopping center in Harlem, who resists rent or urges colored people.
A fire in 1939 made the building very damaged, but when Father Johnson's people planned to rebuilt, they set the bell.
Pastor David Johnson, the son of Cha Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the bell "the bell of the poor."
"A cultural conservatory" and "an unfinished history treasure."
Professional, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University, also noticed that this was the first bell ring in the world played by a colored musician Dionisio A. Lind who pursued the larger bellbeat at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's didn't replace you.
What happened at St. Martin's in the last few months is a complex story of architects and entrepreneurs, some of whom are given by the church leaders, other problems, by the New Catholicism.
Administratives -- the government of the country, including national leaders -- mentioned the church in July, with the fear that the doctrine of "will seek to pass the cost" for the democracy manager, although they are not involved in renting architecturals and contractors mentioned.
Some people are displeasing to the lack of transparency on the side of the church.
Sharp attacked the 13-year-old sea diving boy who caught lobster in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy as he was diving lobsters in California last Saturday, just the first day of the grab season, the authorities were good.
What happened before 7:00 a.m., right near the Beacon's coast in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel reported to San Diego's KSWB-TV that he was driving around half an hour with his friends on that Saturday morning, and he heard the boy crying for help and all swimming out of the water.
Hammel shared that initially claiming that it was just a pleasant scream when he caught a shrimp, but then he said, “I realized that the boy was crying, ‘ I was bitten!
I've been bitten!"
"The whole boy's bone was exposed," Hammel noticed as soon as I got to the boy's place.
"I ask everyone to get out of the water right away, ‘ There are sharks there!" Hammel shared more.
He was moved by a plane to Rady's Children's Hospital in San Diego, where the boy was insurance, in a critical condition.
The name of the shark is the perpetrator of an unidentified attack.
Rescuer, Captain Larry Giles shared in a media conference that they found a shark in this area a few weeks ago, but they identified that it wasn't a dangerous shark.
Giles adds that the victim had to endure the serious injury at his top part.
The officials have closed the exits to the beach from the sea of Ponto in Casablad to Swami's in Eicinitas for 48 hours serving the purpose of investigation and safety.
Giles revealed that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not in danger.
Strategic to the beauty market at Sainsbury's England
Sainsbury's promoting Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with traditional demonstrations, where there always are specialists.
As part of the huge move into the market that looks like 2,8 billion pounds, where it's going to continue to grow while the business of fashion and resources decrease, the more beautiful stores will be tested at 11 stores around the globe and get extensively tested in many stores for the next year.
The investment in the beauty market appears when supermarkets look for ways to use the bar instead of TV, microwave, and supplies.
Sainsbury's said the first time they doubled their beautiful products up to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
These trade strings are available like L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have space and trade zones like the way they show in the store like this at Boots.
Supermarket is also reintensing his Boutique makeup products so that most of the products are just plants -- things are increasingly hunted by young clients.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop will test the absorption at two Sainsbury's, the first store open in Croydon, southern London, last week, and the second store opens at Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year ends.
The online shopping and moving to buy a little food everyday at local business stores means that supermarkets have to focus more blood in attracting customers.
Mike Coupe, the director of Sainsbury's, said that the stores are going to be more like the stores when the supermarket chain tries to face the favors from Aldi and Lidl with more services and food shortages.
Sainsbury's, has brought the bars of Argos into hundreds of stores and also introduced some of the pockets of Habitats since they bought both trading chains two years ago, this has motivated the business of grocery stores and helped to make more profit.
Supermarkets tried to raise their beauty and the pharmaceutical closures but failed.
Sainsbury's experimented business with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but cooperation ended after having a problem with how to divide the trade from the products in the supermarkets.
The new strategy was given after Sainsbury's sold 281 of his pharmaceutical products to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds medicine chain, with 125 million pounds in three years ago.
Knowing that Lloyds will contribute to the plan, by increasing a series of luxurious skin care stores including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the Trade Director of Sainsbury's shared: "We've changed our appearance and feel of beautiful lines to enhance our environment for our clients.
We've also invested in special training for the employees, who are going directly to give counsel.
Series of our stores are designed to match all the needs and environments as well as convenient locations that mean that we are now being a fascinating foot stop, challengeing the traditional shopping."
Peter Jones's "daughter" after Holly Willoughby pulled out the 11 million table contract.
The star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, had been "drift" after the director of Holly Willoughby pulled out the 11 million pounds of his style business to focus on your new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby didn't have time for their furniture and legal charges.
The business of couples is like Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop.
Leading the 37-year-old program of This Morning went to Instagram to announce that you're going to leave.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons' Den, made the star Peter Jones angry when she quit their super-profit business at the last minute -- to focus on her own fat contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
In a Tuesday conference at the headquarters of his business empire at Marlow, Buckinghamshire, the sources say that Jones was "dripped" when the gold girl of the program admits that her new contracts -- are worth more than 1,5 million pounds -- which means that she's no longer enough time to give her heart to their internal and legal case.
Business is like Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop, and it's supposed to be doubled by Willoughby's 11 million pounds.
When the 37-year-old Willoughby came up instagram to announce that she would leave Truth, Jones quickly left England to go to one of his motels.
It's a source to say, "Our time, it's really Holly's first priority.
It's supposed to be her long future that might be with you in the next few decades.
Your decision to leave was astounded by the people involved.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, the time is very close to the presentation.
There's a warehouse full of cargo at Marlow's headquarters ready to release."
Experts believe that the departure of this Morning, one of the Britain's most conceived stars, can make the company pay for millions of dollars by investing hands on products from buffalo and candles to clothes and furniture, and the ability to back the time of the product.
And that could be the end of a long friendship.
The mother of Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin became close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby was instituted Serious with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined as president in March.
The couple went on vacation together and Jones had 40 percent shares in Baldwin's television company.
Willoughby will become an embassy for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin to be the ITV program director, I'm A Celebrity.
A close source with Jones shared last night saying, "We're not going to comment on his business."
It's a big fight, "and it's deep in love."
He's kidding about criticism that he'll get from the media because he's given a comment that some people would consider "not to rule" because he's seen the authority of the Korean leaders.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Mr. Trump speaks with the "Program director."
"I'm not giving up anything."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in the second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June when Mr. Trump excited this was a big step in nuclearization in Korea.
But nuclearization negotiations are stopped.
Over three months after the summit in Singapore, the head of the Foreign Ministry of Ri Yong Ho spoke to the world leaders at the United Nations Council on Saturday that Korea didn't notice the "first response" from the United States for the first attempt of removing North Korea’s weapons.
Instead, he assumed that the United States is continueing the punishment for increased pressure.
Mr. Trump had a much more optimistic view in his speech at his campaign.
"We're doing very well with Korea," he said.
"We're going to war against Korea.
Millions of people may be killed.
Now we're in this good relationship."
He said that efforts to improve his relationship with Kim resulted in positive results -- to end the missiles, to help the liberal trust, and to bring the bones of American soldiers back to their homeland.
And he protected his unusual approach when talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to become president, but instead of 100,000 outside people trying to stir their feet into this tight area, we have about 200 people standing right there," said Mr. Trump, directing towards the crowd right in front of us.
The Earth and the Spirit in Indonesia Destroyed the island and killed the Dead of You
For example, after the tsunami of Lombok’s earthquake, foreign NGOs said that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population had disappeared, there was no declaration of national disasters, a presumptuous condition for international aid.
"Now unfortunately, in many cases, they were very decisive in not requesting international aid, so that was very challenged."
While Save the Children is gathering a group to move to Palu, they are still not sure if foreign employee can work in this area.
Mr. Sutopo, the speaker of the national disaster institutions, said that Indonesian officials are evaluating the situation in Palu to consider whether international organs are allowed to contribute to aid effort.
Despite the continuous earthquakes that in Indonesia had to experience, this nation was not carefully prepared before the anger of nature.
While tsunami refugees were built in Aceh, such sites were not popular in other locations.
Although the warning was effective, lacking tsunami warnings in Palu is likely to result in human damage.
In high times, moving between many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Terror makes the next service even more complicated.
A ambulance ship left in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims who are looking for the way to Palu, but it's going to take at least three days to get to where the tragedy just happened.
President Joko Widodo made the improvement of Indonesia’s old infrastructure into a center of his campaign, and he wasted all the money on the construction of the roads and the railroads.
But the lack of financial deficiency caused trouble for Mr. Joko’s government when he faced the revolt of the next year.
Joko was also facing pressure from the stresss between sects that were not yet ended in Indonesia, when members of most Muslims pursued a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were removed from their homes when Christian gangs and Muslims rushed on the streets, using horses, bows, and other primitive weapons.

The Cromwell statue of Congress became the latest memorial tolerance of the history.
The extraction would be like a poem of justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many puritans who followed him, when they had destroyed countless British architectures and religions.
But the Cromwell Union describes Mr. Crick's words as "disgusting" and "the force to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Committee, said, "It's impossible to escape the debates about leaving the Oliver Cromwell statues outside the Westminster Palace will be the center now.
The symbol of civil wars in England doesn't have Cromwell ordered or executed.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be replaced by Thomas’s father’s actions in the past century.
As representative Cromwell, Mr. William Hamo Thassycroft is a proof of the 19th century's opinion and is part of the history of a character that many believe is still worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith shared with the Sunday Telegraph: Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Maybe at the end of the 19th century would be more than now, Cromwell was considered to be a large congressman against the outside pressure, in his heart, of course a democratic rule.
Even if it's a perfectly accurate pattern for the topic of history debate on the continuing.
It's certainly a 17th-century conflict that shaped the next development of our country and Cromwell as a typical character in dividation.
His achievements as the Protector of God are also worthy of honor and recognition."

The Turbulent of the Rosa hurricane brought large rain on wide to the southwest of the United States
According to the prediction, the hurricane of Rosa is weakening on the way towards the colder seas at the coast of northern Mexico.
However, Rosa will carry rains all over the northern Mexico and the Southeast of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa's got 85 mph winds, one-year-old Bow, counting at 5:00 a.m. Sunday morning, and determined 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Planning the storm of Rosa's moving north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low pressure begins to form on the Pacific and moves east to the West of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in Mexico's areas on Monday.
Then, the dense temperature of low pressure will cause large amounts of rain to spread in the southwest in the next days.
Locally, the amount of rain between 1 to 4 inches will cause dangerous sweeps, fragments, and the possibility of scratching in the desert.
The dense temperature will reach 2 to 3 inches an hour at the scores, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
The amount of rain is from two to four inches in the southwest, especially in the widespread area of Arizona.
The scanners may happen when the situation is rapidly deteriorated by the separation of tropical rain.
The situation would be incredible if the risk was to walk into the desert when there were threats from tropical rain.
Big rains can make the canyons become strong rivers and storms carrying local winds and dust.
Low pressure will carry a lot of big local rains on the coast of South California.
The total amount of rain can reach more than half inch, which is easy to cause fragments and slipped roads.
This will be the first rain of the area during the rain season.
Some tropical rains began to fall in Arizona at the end of Sunday and early Monday, before the rain became more popular at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
Big rain will reach Four Corners on Tuesday and extend to Wednesday.
There may be some severe temperatures around the United States in October when the Arctic is colder, but the tropical area is still warm.
Sometimes this leads to significant changes in temperatures in neighboring locals.
A typical example of significant temperature distortion in the U.S. Center on Sunday.
It's almost 20 degrees between Kansas, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, summer warmth and the question will be restored and reinstated.
Most of the central and eastern parts of the United States are expected to have a warm start in October, which is common in about 80 in the Southern Plains region to the northern areas.
New York City temperature can be 80 degrees on Tuesday, 10 degrees higher.
The long-day weather project is showing the high temperature is going to be an average in the eastern United States during the early half of the October.
Over 20 million people follow Brett Kavanaugh's hearing.
More than 20 million people followed the celebration of Thursday on six TV systems of the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that was supposed to happen in the 1980s, Mrs. Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political suspension continues, with the interrupting television stations frequently interrupting the broadcasting program with the last minute news on Friday: an agreement was made by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake for the FBI to run on a week of charges.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was drunk and tried to remove her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in calm motion, said he was 100% sure that it didn't happen.
It's possible that more than 20,4 million people have followed the hearing, according to Nielsen pointed out in Friday's report.
Company has calculated the average number of people on ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers haven't even included for other television stations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often encounters some problems when calculating people in the office.
In order to relate to the relationship, the audience's numbers are similar to a last ticket game or Oscar Prize.
Fox News Channel, who gave a strong support to the appointment of Kavanaugh, led all the stations with an average 5,69 million people who watched during the entire day's hearing, Nielsen shared.
The second ABC stands with 3,26 million people.
CBS with 3,1 million, NBC 2,94 million, MSNBC 2,89 million and CNN is 2,52 million, Nielsen says.
The concern is still great after the hearing.
Flake was a central character in the noise of Friday.
After the Republican's peacemaker just announced that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was tracked by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning that he was screamed when he tried to move the elevator to the hearing of the Justice Committee.
He stood with his eyes down in a few minutes when interrogated, direct TV on the CNN.
"I'm standing in front of him," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the nation?"
He was condemned, "You have power while too many women are in power."
Flake said before the elevator closed that his office had made a statement, that he would have much to say at the hearing of the committee.
All the cables and television stations covered for hours directly after that, when the Justice Committee will have to vote for Mr. Brett Kavanaugh's recommendation.
But Flake said that he would only do that when he knew that the FBI would consider the charges against the candidate next week, which some people of the democracy have urged.
Flake's been convinced part of his conversations with his partner, Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and some senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice is heavy, because it's obvious that the Republicans won't have Kavanaugh criteria without investigating.
President Trump launched an FBI investigation on charges against Kavanaugh.

Volcano flows into the City of Mexico
The Tro erupted from the Popocatepetl volcano has flown to the south of the capital of Mexico.
The National Army Room has warned the Mexicans on Saturday that stay away from volcanic volcanic volcano after the grinding volcano is active, and they notice 183 amounts of emission and ashes within 24 hours.
The center's been tracking a lot of movements and shaking.
Scientist images on the Internet show that the thin ashes blurred the windshields in the cities of Mexico, like Xochimilco.
Physical geologists have noticed the increase in volcanic activity about 45 miles (72 km) southeast the capital since a 7,1 degrees of richer earthquake has vibrated the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
The police had a problem with the Catalan separators before the anniversary of the vote.
Six of them were arrested in Barcelona Saturday after the protesters of their independent supporters were confronted with violent police, when thousands of participants were signing the first vote of both sides of the Catalonia for the separation.
A group of scramblers in the masks held by the police against the violence kept by eggs and powder, causing black clouds on the streets of the tourists.
The chaos came up at the end of the day when the police used the squirrel to suppress the fight.
For hours, independent supporters shout "Don't forget, unforgivable" against protesters against the word "Great Spain."
The fourteen were treated for the slight wounds in protests, according to the local newspapers.
The stress was still high in the area independent thinking a year after the October 1's proposal was considered illegal with Madrid but was accepted by the Catalan separation.
Independent voters are oppressive, although low-proportions of support to the antipartiers of the majority are discharging the election.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people had been injured last year after the police tried to prevent the vote happening at the vote sites in the middle of the ravages.
Independence supports have camped over Friday nights to prevent a demonstration for national police.
The demonstration took place first, but it had to happen with other developments.
Narcis Termes, 68 years old, an electrician attended the debate with his wife saying that he had no hope for the prospects of Catalonia for independence.
"We've been through the happiest moments last year.
I looked at my parents crying for joy when they could vote but now we're stuck," he shared.
While winning the biggest winning of the regional elections last December, Catalan’s independent supporters have fought to keep their motivation this year with their most famous leaders or being separated from their country or being held in prison because of their role in promoting independent nationality afterwards.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, turned back to the debate for the police on his phone, saying that the conflict was cut off by politicians in both sides.
"The story is getting more stressful," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison before the trial last year, claimed he was going to vote in the European Senate election next year.
"Tham's as a candidate for the European Elections is the best way to democracy in democracy and oppression that we've seen from the Spanish government," he said.

Menga's pussy brings one-0 wins to Livingston before Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first lead to Livingston must have won
Livingston's coming up to surprise Rangers when this Ibrox yard team is led by Steven Gerrard with only two fights in 18 games.
Dolly Menga's desk shows a difference when Gary Holt's side is up to Hibernian for a few seconds.
Gerrard's team hasn't got a winner in the Monday Principals and face the Hearts oil directors, eight points leading, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers welcomed Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston, has extended his victory chain in six games, when the trainer Holt has been tasteless since instead of Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston missed the chance to fight the guests underneath.
Holt's team was supposed to lead before they had a table, with their intuitive strategy that made Rangers so hard.
Scott Robinson's cramped but crossed the target, then Alan Lithgow could only direct his efforts to be stronger after leading the ball to Craig Halkett across the bridge.
The host of the firms to play with the Rangers in front of them, knowing that they can bring trouble to the team with personal techniques.
And that's a strategic strategic for the set of scores.
Rangers made a kick and Livingston leads first, Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined towards Menga, who had a bunch of balloons and scores in the middle of the bridge.
At this point, Rangers took advantage of keeping the shadow, but found that the defensive line can't cross and Liam Kelly's master is almost unable to have any problems,
So the game goes on to the second round, even though Alfredo Morelos received help from Kelly.
Scott Pittman has failed under his feet as Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow turned into another playsman of Livingston.
The continuous ball guides to the Livingston frame and are continuously grabbed, when there are two temple penaltys -- after Halkett's challenges for the replacer Glenn Middleton, one because of the hit of the shadow -- they've been compromised.
'Label' with Livingston - analysis
from Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Games.
A result and a complete game for Livingston.
Excellent teams, continue to look forward in the backwards.
Their play style and their players have rarely changed since they returned to their head position, but significant services have been for Holt because of the way he wielded the team since he appeared.
You have too many strong players.
Captain Halkett is a man of guts, organized a great defensive line, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall's feet.
But Rangers lacked inspiration.
As in Gerrard's time, they didn't get those standards.
The last punch fails -- the only chance to open the front door -- and it's a glimpse for Rangers, the team that lands in the middle of the board.
Erdogan received a lot of humiliation at Cologne
There were good smiles and weather on Saturday (29 September) when Turkish and German leaders met breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of the vigilant visit by President Erdogan to Germany in order to repair the relationships between NATO allies.
They have discussed problems that include human rights, free presses, and Turkey joining the EU.
Later, Erdogan moved to Cologne to the dedication of a new spectacular Muslim church.
This city is the largest Turkey population outside Turkey.
The police in charge of security to stop the 25,000 people in front of the Muslim Church, but a lot of supporters are there to meet their president.
Hundreds of protested against Erdogan -- many of them Kurd -- also spoke, condemned the whole Erdogan policy and the German government’s decision to welcome him to this country.
Two extreme protests reflect the division of a guest who is praised as a hero of some of the Turks in Germany and being cursed by others as a professional.

Chief Long Lartin: Six officers injured in the violence
Six injured employees in a violent prison for a strict security custody, the prison authorities reported.
The riot started at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire about 9:30 BST Sunday morning and still happening.
The "Tornado" experts have been led to the chaos, ending at about 17:30.
Officers were examined right at the scene with small wounds.
The speaker of the prison manager said: "The specialized prison officer was developed to deal with what was happening at HMP Long Lartin.
Six injured staff have been treated.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons and obviously that the individuals involved will be transferred to the police and could spend more time after the trauma."
The HM Long Lartin prison held over 500 prisoners, including the most dangerous criminals in the country.

And in October last year, the violent warriors were called to a prison to deal with a serious rebellion in which the employees were attacked with bi-a balls.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, the Salt Lake City with the Deluge.
Very rarely low tropical pressure attacks Arizona, but that's exactly what can happen next week when the power forces of the Rosa storm on the southwest desert are still, pulling the sweep risks.
The National Air Force Department has released surveillance of the scannings on Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona to South and East Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake.
The hurricane Rosa expected to follow a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, but before that Monday night there was rain.
The National Air Force in Phoenix mentioned in a report that only ten tropical tropical tornados formed tropical storm or low tropical pressure within 200 miles flow into Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina Storm (1967) is a storm within 40 miles to the Arizona border."
The latest prediction models from the National Storm Center predicted the size of rains about 2 to 4 inches, with a separation level of floods up to 6 inches in the Golden Mogollon belt in Arizona.
The other areas of the Southwest desert of the Rockies Center and the Bowl of the Earth may be flooded from one to two inches, with a separating level of flood can be up to 4 inches.
With unprecedented flood zones, the rain from Rosa hurricane could be a good sign because this area is drought.
While flooding is a deep concern, some of the waterfalls can rejoice because the eastern region is intriguing the drought.
According to news from weather.com The U.S. Drought Observatory says that only 40 percent of the Arizona area are intriguing the lowest level of drought, but still the second height in the same category.
First, Bourne Rosa's palace crossed the land across the island of Baja California in Mexico.
Rosa's still in the storm at maximum 85 miles of the hour, south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico 355 miles, and moving north to 12 miles a hour.
The storm hits the colder seas in the Pacific and then weakens.
Thus, the prediction indicates that there will be landbroken in Mexico when the pressure of the tropical passes on the Monday evening.
The amount of rain falls on areas in Mexico may be significant, signaling the possibility of flooding in a small way.
According to Weather.com, "The estimated amount of rain from 3 to 6 inches from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, could be up to 10 inches."
Rosa will head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early on Tuesday as low tropical pressure, then sweep over Arizona and fall into South Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main danger of predicting from Rosa or its absence is a huge amount of rain in Baja California, West Sonora and the Southwest desert of the United States," said the National Storm Center.
These rains are expected to cause sweeps and waterfalls that threaten the lives of deserts and landbreaking in the mountain territories.

Trump shares that Kavanaugh ‘ endures the selfish, anger of the Democratic Party.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the cruel and excessive tactics of the Democratic Party," said Mr. Trump in a campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Mr. Trump says that Mr. Kavanaugh has endured the selfish, anger of the Democratic Party throughout his candidate.
Kavanaugh in front of Congress on Thursday, denied a strong and firm accusation from Christine Blasey Ford that he had attacked her for decades before they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed at the hearing of her accusations.
The President said Saturday, "Americans have witnessed Kavanaugh's greatness and virtue and courage" that day.

The president mentioned the details of Brett Kavanaugh's candidate when he spoke of the importance of voting to the Republicans in the middle of the vote.
There's only five weeks left to one of the most important elections in life.
I'm not running but running." You share.

Hundreds of people died by earthquakes, tsunamis in Indonesia, and the damage has increased.
At least 384 people died, many were drifted when the giant waves hit the beachs, when a great earthquake and tsunami fell into Indonesia’s island of Sulawesi, the authorities said that on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered in a beach feast in Palu Friday when the waves were up to six feet [18 feet] to the shore at sunset, sweeping, causing many people to die and destroy everything on their way.
The gods followed a powerful 7,5 degrees earthquake.
"When the threat of tsunami appeared yesterday, people were still involved in their activities on the beach and did not leave immediately and they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the speaker from the National Academy of Nation Academy, shared in a newspaper in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come by itself, it pulled along cars, woods, houses, sweep through everything on the ground," said Nugroho, and added that the tsunami had passed through the open sea at 800 kph before landing at the coast.
Some climbed onto a tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Photos from the air were released by the catastrophic facility show that many buildings and stores were destroyed, broken twisted bridges and collapsed and a mosque was flooded in water.
The explosion continues to shake the city in the coast on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes have been seen in a region with 2,4 million people.
Indonézia’s Excellency and Technical Institutional Institute (BPPT) states that in the release of the energy released by the sixth - day powerful earthquake was about 200 times higher than the energy of the atomic bomb fell down in the city of Hiroshima during World War II.
The location of the city, lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have increased the size of tsunami, according to the public.
Nugroho describes the damage as "to great" and says that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of the collapsed buildings, reporting, there were 540 wounded and 29 missing.
Nugroho says that deaths and damages may not be stopped along the coast of 300 miles (190 miles) north of Palu, a region called Donggala, which is nearer to the trauma of the earthquake.
The media's "very paralyzed with no news" from Donggala, Mr. Nugroho said.
There are over 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross in a statement, and at the same time, their workers and volunteers are coming to the affected area.
"This was a tragedy, but the tragedy could become more horrible," they said.
This Saturday authorities were explicitly condemned because they did not announce that the tsunami came to Palu, although officials said that the wave had arrived at warning time.
In an uncompromising video on the social network, it shows that there's a man upstairs screaming to the people on the road about the approaching tsunami.
A few minutes later, a wall of water came into the shore and swept the buildings and the cars.
Reuters didn't verify the video.
Earthquakes and tsunamis have caused massive power losses to break the regional communication around Palu, which made the government difficult to combine rescue efforts.
The authorities say, the Army has begun to dispose of transportation planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuators still need food and other basic resources.
The city airport has been reopened for relief efforts and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is planning to visit the evacuation centers at Palu Sunday.
The number of the Nets in Indonesian Spirits increased over 800.
It's very bad.
While the workers of World Vision came from Donggala safely to Palu, where the staff were built in the office courtyard, they passed the devastated scenes on the road, Mr. Domba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
It's bad.
Even when the aid groups began significantly in the beginning of disaster relief tools, some complained that foreign aids with high experts were prevented from moving to Palu.
Indonézia’s regulations, finances, investment, and humanitarianity can only begin if the location of catastrophe is declared to be a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened.
"This is still an emergency disaster," said Aulia Arriani, the speaker of the Indian Cross.
"After the government decides, "Yes, this is a national disaster," we can't be ready for international support but there's no speech."
When the second night falls on Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family who are still missing hoped that their loved ones will be miracles to combine the dark stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled up from the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman stuck under a ruin in two days with her mother's body next to her.

Others were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Brother Mandagi, his students.
"It's an extremist in the vehicle field, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon relates, in a few hours after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Roa spread in the communities, he was despairly texting by WhatsApp for the opponents at Palu, who were attending the beach conference.
His message, however, only had a gray stage instead of two green ones.
"I think that means that the messages were not sent away," he said.

Rapper changed his name to Ye.
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He wrote in the announcement about the change on Twitter on Saturday: "You know that I'm Kanye West."
West, 41 years old, named Ye for a while and used this name as the eighth album released in June.
The change took place before you showed up on Saturday Night Live, when you were expected to release a new Yandhi album.
You're a guest to offer a program for Dr. Ariana Grande when you report you're "conscientious", the creator of the program tells you.
The same way that West used to write in his current name, the word used to mean religion to him.
"I believe that "ye" is the most popular word in the Bible and in the Bible that means "friend"," West shared this year, while talking about his album title with Big Boys.
"My name is friends, I am us, it's us.
The shift went from Kanye, which means the only thing, Ye -- the reflection of good, the bad, what goes wrong, everything.
Album is more than our own reflection.
You're one of the famous rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs is known widely with the name Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year you're saying you're looking for Love and Brother Love.
A artist who used to work with West, JAY-Z, was also wondering whether there was or not a cross-line mark and did not write flowers.
The President of Mexico claimed not to send forces against civilians.
The elected president of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador declared he would never use military forces against civilians when this country approached the memorial of 50 years of bloody revenge of students.
Lopez Obrador has made a commitment on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Square that, "there's never been given the army to oppress the Mexican people."
The Army fired in a demonstration of peace at the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at that time when the left student movements were rooting all over Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has sworn to support mexican young men by administering monthly services to the students and extending free public universities.
He shared that the problem of unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led youths to get involved in the worst.
The United States should double the A.I. Aid.
When China becomes more active in the artificial intelligence, the United States should double the money for research in this area, investors and professionals on AI Kai-Fu Lee, who used to work for Google, Microsoft, and Apple share.
The ideas were made after the different parts of the United States government made an AI announcement, even while the entire United States were lacking the official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced his plan last year: the goal of returning the country to the AI innovation to 2030.
"Al research budget doubles will be a positive start, because all other countries are falling after the U.S.A. very far, and we're looking for the next breakthrough in AI," said Lee.
Duplic the cost can double the chance that the next giant AI achievement will be done in the United States, Lee shared with the CNBC during an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book "China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" published in this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the director of Sinovation Ventures, invested in one of the most outstanding AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked at an AI that defeated Othello player in America with the highest class, then he was the director at Microsoft Research and Google branch director in China.
Lee approached the former technology competitions of the U.S. government like the Technical Test of the U.S. Project Research and care when the next competition is going to take place, to help determine the next vision.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government aid, Lee shared.
"It's not Chinese calling for all scholars to go; it's corporations," said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired light stars from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee shared changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to strengthen their efforts on AI.
He added: "I think the blue card should be automatically given to doctors about AI."
The China Institution planned the next generation's Humanity Intelligence Development plans in July 2017.
Lee adds: China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides aid to those who are in the same technological organizations as the way the Fund and other governments give money to researchers of the United States, but the quality of research is lower in China.
Early this year in the United States of Defense Department has established a Creator's Union Center, in order to interfere with partners from industry and education, and the White House has announced the create Committee of Human Intelligence Filtering.
In this month, the Director of the Defense Research Projects progressed to propose two billion dollars investment for a project named AI Next.
At the National Science Foundation, they now invest more than 100 million dollars a year for AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. law has been looking for a National Security Council of Made Intelligence but hasn't seen any movements in months.
The people of Macedonia vote in the promotion of the country's name change.
The Macedonians vote in the public promotion on Sunday about whether to change their names into "The North Macedonian Peace", which is a decade-decimal decisive action to prevent the joining of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, a province named Macedonia, claimed that the name of the northern neighbors corresponds to their own territory and has declined joining NATO and EU.
The two governments signed a deal in June based on the newly proposed name, but those who oppose nationalism claimed that this change would weaken the ethnicity of most Slavians in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov claimed that he would not vote in the bridge and a vegetarian campaign had made a doubt that the vote would have responded at least 50 percent demanded the validity of the people's proposal.
The question on the proposal of the people is, "Do you agree to be a member of NATO and the EU with approval of the agreement with Greece."
Advocates of the names, including the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claimed that it was a price to pursue the joining of organizations such as the EU and NATO of Macedonia, one of the nations that rise from Jugoslav’s collapse.
Olivera Georgijevska, 79-year-old, in Skopje, said: "I'm here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youths in Macedonia so that they can freely enjoy the support of the European Union because that's what's going to do for us all."
Although the members of the Congress were not legally bound, they said they would follow the vote to make a decision.
Changing names will take two-thirds of congress votes.
The National Elections said there was no report of abnormality until 1 p.m.
However, the vote rate is only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent of the national election last year when 66 percent of the vote registered.
Test Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old at the capital of Skopje, shared: "I'm going to vote for my children, because our position is in Europe."
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and his son, Dushko, voted in the National Respect in Macedonia for changing the name of the country, which would open the way for NATO and the European Union to Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
Before the council in Skopje, Vladimir Karvardarkov, 54 years old, was preparing a tiny stage and pulling a chair before the tent, built by the people who would dispose of the folks.
Kavadarkov said, "We support NATO and EU, but we want to join the main road, not through the back door."
"We're a poor country, but poor to clean.
If they don't think of us as Macedonia, we can switch to other countries like China and Russia and become part of the Asian bond."
The Prime Minister Zaev said that as a member of NATO would bring very vital investments to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20%.
"I believe most of us will agree because over 80 percent of our citizens support EU and NATO," said Mr. Zaev after the vote.
He shared that a "appropriate" outcome would be "service to our future."
A survey published on Monday last week by the Macedonian Political Research Institute said that about 30 to 43 percent of the voters would be involved in the demanding proposal - lower vote.
Another poll, which was done by the Macedonian Telma TV, says 57 percent of people were asked to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said that they made a contract vote.
A successful human proposal has to be 50 percent of the vote and one vote.
Failure in the public proposal shows the first severe hit with the policy of Western government since last May.

Scherzer wants to burn us up to Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the last ticket squad, there's no reason to start again.
But a Scherzer was hoping to win the Sunday tournament with Colorado Rockies, but this was only the point when the rockies were competitioned with the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
Rockies won at least one probability with 5-2 to Nationals on Friday night, but they're still trying to keep the head of the board award.

Trump's Attack in West Virginia
The president mentioned the details of the situation around his high court, selecting Brett Kavanaugh as to the importance of voting to the Republicans in the middle of the election.
"All we do has potential in November.
There's only five weeks left to one of the most important elections in life.
This is one of the big, big things -- not running but running is the reason that I go around fighting for the bright candidates." He shared.
Mr. Trump goes on, "You'll see the negative, negative democracy is in existence right now.
And they're determined to subdue rights by using any tactics, and then you'll see selfishness, strategies.
They don't care who hurts, who has to step over to gain power and control, they only want power and control, and we won't give it to them."
He added, "Democracy is trying to "became and interrupt."
"You've seen it in the last four days." He adds and says that the Democratic Party is "sexual and selfish and tricky and false."
You pointed out the Senate's Senator Dianne Feinstein, which has stumbled in the lamentation from the bottom.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you reveal the information?
What?
No, no, I'm expecting -- it's a kind of non-specific body language -- it's the worst kind of body language I've ever seen.
Lao's no longer an open party.
Conceptions Are Unacceptable
I'm not surprised that Momentum's activists, in my local party, voted to check on me.
Finally, I was the latest in a series of Lao delegates announced that I was not welcome -- because I gave my opinion.
As a member of the Congress with me, Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she was determined to support opposition.
In my case, the censor's motion was on me because I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of a size of economic policy, national security, in Europe, the same irrational issues that Jeremy did not agree with the previous leaders.
Reporting to the Lao Nottingham East Conference on Fridays said, "We want the meeting to be compounded and effective."
For almost eight years as a congressman for the local Lao, Friday evening leaderships took place like that.
Unfortunately, today, it's not a voice in many meetings and political promises that "death and gentleer" have been forgotten for a long time and actually assumed that it's ever started."
It's increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Lao Party and all of the opinions are considered to be advocate whether the heads of the party accept it or not.
This started right after Jeremy became the leader, because my former colleagues, I thought that my political view was starting to expect me to change my mind and take the positions that I would never approve -- whether it was national security or the EU marketing.
Whenever I speak publicly - and actually I say something -- pulling the abuse on social media, calling out to remove, the central political charge, telling me that I shouldn't be part of the Lao Party.
And it's not just me to see that.
In fact, I know that I am more lucky than some of my colleagues because my comments pointed to me have political trends.
I was surprised by the professionality and determination of colleagues, who had to face the flow with abusive sexual differences or racial differences every day but never avoided.
One of the sadst aspects of this political age is the level of abuse that has become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that Lao Party should concentrate tolerance.
In fact, we're no longer that open party and with every "unselfish" act or a change of choice rules, the party has become narrow.
I've got a lot of advice in the past two years about urgeing me to stay calm, don't say too much and then I'm gonna "stop it."
But I'm not in politics.
Since I joined the Lao Party 32 years before I was just a boy, I was motivated by the obligation of the Thatcher government, which caused my full school to collapse literally, I've tried to bring better services to those who need them most -- whether local council or government ministers.
I never covered my political view, even at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can be misplaced about my political positions and my disagreements with the current leader.
For those who have moved on Friday, all I want to share is that when my country in Brexit, it will hurt our homes, businesses, and public services, I don't want to waste my time and energy in loyalty to the Lao leader.
But actually, a message outside Nottingham Momentum that I watched, sent to my voters, whether to be a Lao party member, or not: I'm proud to serve and I promise that there will be no threat to remove or any political means that can prevent me from acting for what I believe is the greatest benefit of my grandmother.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Lost Leader Ayr
Two later tests may have missed the final results, but no doubt, Ayr deserves to win the Tenent Premiership match today.
Now they're in the head of the table, the only king of the ten squads.
In any case, it's also their superficial defense, as much as the better opportunity for them, to bear the host and coach Peter Murchie's right to be pleased.
He says, "To this day, we've gone through our fights until now and we're still defeated, so I'm satisfied."
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Ghi accepts Ayr, they take the better chances than us."
Grant Anderson's 14th desk, which Frazier Climo adds, leads Ayr first, but, a gold card for Captain Scotland Rory Hughes, opens the game for Warriors, allowing Melrose to show the manual and Jason Baggot to set a ball to the field.
Climo has advanced to Ayr with a penalty, before, in the first round, he wrote the table and then added a solo point up to 17-5 for Ayr before break.
But Melrose has started two rounds in a good way, and Patrick Anderson sets up, Baggot adds more points, shortens the score down five points.
After a long period of serious trauma to Ruaridh Knott, who was reset, and since reinstated, Ayr had led the extensively by Stafford McDowall's work, Climo adds more points.
Captain Ayr, Blair Macpherson, then with the gold cards, and again, Melrose made the second player with a table recorder of Bruce Colvine, before a tension pressure.
However, the house owners returned, and when Struan Hutchinson had a golden card for the Climo against the ball, from the temple penalty, MacPherson had a point on the Ayr's support.
Climo puts more points, as he did almost since the reincarnation, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's ball and passed to the player who runs Gregor Henry after the fifth grade of the house owner.
Still Game Star is ready to enter the restaurant business.
Still Game's star, Ford Kieran is about to move to the hotels after knowing he's considered the director of a permitted restaurant company.
The 56-year-old star played Jack Jarvis in the BBC movie, which he himself wrote and acted with the hard scorpion in Greg Hemphill.

"The sea is ours": the country is not bordering the Bolivian sea hoping the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines patrol a Navy headquarters equipped in La Paz.
The public buildings hang the blue flag.
The Navy bases from Lake Titicacaca to Amazon are painted with the slogans: "The sea is our right.
It's our job to get the sea back."
Every glimpse in the land of Bolivia, the memory of a loss of coast in Chile in a bloody 19th-century strife -- as well as the desire to carry out to the Pacific again.
Those hopes may be the burningest for decades, because Bolivia was waiting for the judgment of the International Justice Court on October 1, after five years of consideration.
Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomatic, shared: "Bolivia has motivation, unity, and calmness, and of course a positive view of results."
Many of the Bolivians will observe the ICJ's judgment on large screens in the country, hoping that the court in the Hague will support Bolivia’s claim, that - after decades of stress - chile exchanges were negotiating to Bolivia a marinial sea.
Evo Morales, who was persuasive president of Bolivia, faced a brutal debate debate for the next year -- also had many cards in the second day's judgment.
At the end of August, he was determined, "We're going back to the Pacific Sea."
But some analysts say that the court is unable to decide to support Bolivia - and that is less likely to change.
The LHQ with the Dutch headquarters has no right to give the territory to Chile and has decreed that they will not determine the results of potential exchanges.
ICJ's decision was made only after six months when the last debates were put to the "not complicated," said Paz Zarate, an expert on Chile's international law.
And even further, Bolivia's jurisdiction, that last four years can be turned back.
Zorate says, "The problem with the sea has been attacked by the current Bolivian government."
She adds, Mr. Morales’s war statements turned off all the goods left of Chile.
At some point, Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate with each other, but it will be extremely difficult to organize discussions after this.
Two countries haven't trade ambassador since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the decision of the court was unusual.
Monday will bring to Bolivia "a wonderful opportunity to open a new era with a relationship with Chile" and a chance to end 139 years of differences in the interests of each other," he shared.
Calzadilla also denys that Morales -- is still one of the most famous presidents in Latin America -- is using seafish as a political lifesaving facility.
Bolivia added, "Bolivia will never give up access to the Pacific."
"Judging is a chance to see that we need to walk through the past."
Korea says there'll never be a nuclear dissolve unless they can trust the United States.
The Foreign Secretary of the CODDND Korean Ri Yong Ho reveals that your country will never remove nuclear weapons unless they can trust Washington before that.
Mr. Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations Council.
He called the United States to fulfill the promises in the summit convention in Singapore between the two - side leaders.
He made a comment when the U.S. Prime Minister Mike Pompeo seems to be ready to reinitiate nuclear diplomatic policy over three months after the meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un Korean leader.
Ri says that it's a fantasy to continue the punishment and opposition of the United States to declare the end of the Korean war in order to bring down the Koreans.
Washington is cautiously agreeing with the statement without Ping Angie to perform the remarkable action of removal of the weapons first.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump wanted a second supreme meeting.
But there's no small skepticism that Ping Angyang is very serious about removing a warehouse that this country can see as the only way to secure safety.
Mr. Pompeo is planning on the next month's tour to prepare for the Kim-Trump summit again.
The Paris Page releases the latest production of the broad helmets that are about to cover all the big streets near you.
If you want to expand the helmet collection or completely avoid the sunlight, you don't have to search far away.
The designer Valentino and Thom Browne exposed a series of strange squad designs in their SS19 collection on the runway would dramatize the design at the Paris Day Weeks.
High-quality hats have swept Instagram this summer and the designers mentioned have brought their eyes on the floor.
Valentino's preliminary thing is an overwhelming black hat that is attached to feather-like sides, covering the model's head.
The other too much size tables include the witch, the witch hat, and even a penguin -- but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also reveals a series of weird masks -- just in time for Halloween.
A lot of slippery masks are stitched in their lips more like Hannibal Lecter than high-fashioned fashion.
A design like a full sea diving device with the air tube and the conservation glass, and another device looks like a melted cream cream.
And if you keep catching in the giant fashion -- you're lucky.
The tombs predict that large-scale ear hats can soon cover a wave all over the big streets near you.
The big helmets became hot on the heels "La Bomba", the large and wider helmet that Rihanna used to Emily Ratajkowski.
The fame mark behind the incredibly incredibly unrealistic hat was thrown into all the social media that brought another big creativity on the scene -- a pocket that went to the beach in close to the bathing suit.
The burnt orange raffia thread, with a raffia thread with a white arm, was a highlight in the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus at the Paris fashion week.
The famous sampler Luke Armitage shared with the FES: “I hope to see big hats and sea pockets over the big streets in the next summer -- because the designer has produced a huge impact that is so hard to overlook the needs of the superstitious substitutes."
The foreign skills are essential for global citizens.
Scotland’s private schools maintain their outstanding skills, which were continued in 2018 with a chain of commendable study results, which were strengthened by both individual and collected in sports, art, music, and community activities.
With over 300,000 students across Scotland, these schools were supported by the Scotland Law Council (SCIS), trying to bring the best service quality to students and parents.
Independent schools focus on equipment of deep and wide knowledge, as well as orienting your students' profession and position as global citizens.
As a sector of education that can be designed and run the special teaching program of the school, we see modern languages continue to be a common and chosen topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, "If you talk to someone in his language he understands, what says goes into his reason.
If you talk to him in his own language, things that say will go into his feelings."
This is a persuasive message that we don't just rely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From recent exams of this year, we can see that foreign languages are taking the lead in ranking tablets with scores through private schools.
The total 68 percent of foreign students have gained a higher point than A.
The data collected from 74 members of SCIS shows that 72 percent of students gained more than the A point in China, alongside 72 percent of German learning, 69 percent of French and 63 percent of Spanish learning, gained a point A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are following a foreign direction as vital skills that children and teenagers will not be available in the future.
In private school programs, as well as elsewhere, foreign learnings are being considered as the main STEM (cameology, technology, technology, and mathematics).
A survey that was conducted by the Expert Council and Identities of England in 2014 showed that in the reasons that the recruiters had difficulty finding people, the lack of foreign skills.
As a result, foreign skills become increasingly more practical to equip young ones to enter their future career.
With the more opportunities for prosperity needed to have foreign languages, these skills become practical in a world that is increasingly flat.
Regardless of how people choose their job, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future when they have such a full-time skill.
It is possible to communicate directly in the language of the locals itself, and a multilingual person will obviously lead all the challenges.
According to a YouGov survey over 4,000 adults in England in 2013, 75 percent of them were unable to practice a simplicity in another language, and only French is the only proportion to a number of units, 15 percent.
That is why it is vital for children to be invested in foreign education today.
Grabing in a multilingual hand, especially the tongues of developing economy, will equip children with more brighter possibilities in finding a real job.
In Scotland, each school teaches different languages.
Some schools will focus on moderner languages, while some other schools will teach foreign languages that are considered to be important to Britain in view of the year 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever youths enjoy, there are various languages to choose in private schools, along with a professional teacher team.
Scotland’s private schools focus on a technical environment that prepares and equips children with vital skills for success, no matter what the future is hiding.
Can't deny that in an international business environment, foreign language will continue as a very important factor to the future of the country, this should be widely used in education.
In fact, modern languages should be judged as international communication skills.
Privacy schools will continue to give this opportunity to youths of Scotland: diversity and output.
There's no other choice.

The TT Trump campaign in West Virginia, YouTube.
Tonight, at Wheeling, West Virginia, President Donald Trump started campaign.
This is the first stop on the five TT. Trump campaigns in the next week, including stopping in facilities like Tennessee and Mississippi.
The standard vote for the candidate that you're recommending to the empty position of the Supreme Court is being delayed, President Trump is struggling to support the next mid election, when the Republicans are at risk of losing the control of the Congress when the vote begins in November.
The TT. Trump movement in West Virginia begins at what time tonight and how can you see it online?
The TT. Trump campaign in Wheeling City, West Virginia was expected to start at 7:00 tonight on east, Saturday, Day 29/09, 2018.
You can track the TT Trump movement in West Virginia directly on YouTube.
President Trump may refer to Brett Kavanaugh's observation this week -- the Supreme Court candidate -- who is now facing sexual assaults and the voting of the Senate has to move a week to the FBI on the investigation.
However, the main purpose of these stunning stages is to warn warriors to support the Republican candidates before the vote in November.
So, according to Reuters, the target of campaigns through the next week's 05 campaigns to "power the volunteers and supporters of the Republicans in the companies they hold in the Senate and the Congress."
"The Congress control is an important issue in the congress, so the president will visit the country as many as possible before entering the busy election season," said a TT. Trump who wants to hide the name to Reuters.
Proceeding in Wesbanco Games, Wheeling City, this night's campaign could attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and at the same time attracted the media Pittsburgh to deliver the news", the West Virginia Metro News reported.
Saturday will be the second TT. Trump visit in the last month to West Virginia, the state he won a 40% separately in 2016.
TT. Trump is trying to support Patrick Morriley, the Republican candidate for the Senator of State West Virginia, because this man is now in the following survey.
According to Reuters, directing Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University: "The President must visit the state to fight support in the vote for the candidate is not a good sign for Morriley."
Dou Ryder in 2018: The U.S. Team is determined to keep the troops in the single fights on Sunday.
After three uncompressed fights, the double game on Saturday afternoon could be necessary for Cup Ryder.
It's a whole new idea of sports, but it's also the effect that the sporter really believes, especially in competitions like this.
So where is the current motivation?
"They've led six points, flying now only four, and I think that's the motivation for us," said Jordan Spieth shared in the open walk.
Of course, the European team has the advantage, leads four points, and they have 12 games.
As Spieth said, the American recruits still have a little hope, and they are encouraged so much, especially with the Spieth and Justin Thomas together.
Spieth is an ex-wide genius in splashing from the football position to the golf hole and he always leads his lead as a example.
The shoutings of joy increased when they came to his ring, especially the ballball tricks to reconcile the game when you and Thomas were in the golf hole.
The 15th winning ballball is the same as that, which means you're full of trusting in the backwards of the U.S. team.
Spieth says, "You must think carefully and worry about your own fight."
All the athletes left.
There's 18 holes left to score.
In the last two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, a undeniable legend of Cup Ryder, was the only couple who had a higher number than Spieth and Thomas.
This strange couple of European recruits won 4:0 and never made a mistake.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't fight bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogey on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and nine golf holes later on Friday morning.
That winning and the energy from them spread to the crowds of cheerleaders who make it feel that they are two enemies who need to beat the Sunday; and no more gangsters are worth more than Fleetwood or Molinari to protect the winner of the European recruits at sundown on the Le Golf National.
Hopefully both of you appear in different golf holes.
Even though, it's still too early to confirm the winner of the European recruits.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of fourball fights in the morning, when they fought with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double in the first nine holes caused the Spanish and Swedish survivors to lose their chances of retaliating.
On Sunday, I'm afraid no one can pull them out of that failure.
Fourball and foursome fights are always best for the interaction between the pairs, their advice and the watch of the game strategies that change only in the rules.
The European Team competition is better and has led it far away before the last day of the game, but this foursome game series shows that the American Team has a complete chance to win.
European recruits lead to 10-6 before the last day of the Ryder competition.
The European recruits will take advantage of the last day of the Ryder competition after four balls and foursome spectacular games, leading to the U.S. team 10-6.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari took the lead with two Tiger Woods wins to win four more points on Le Golf National.
Thomas Björn on the European recruit team, who was determined to regain the troops to lose his team in Hazeltine two years ago, won over the U.S. side during the four-ball battle in the morning, leading to 3-1.
The U.S. team fights better in a foursome series, wins two games, but can't win the last.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points in a series of single competitions on Sunday to get back.
Fleetwood was the first European marchman who won four consecutive points when he and Molinari, often called "Molliwood" couple, was the second couple after the last week of the drama game, which won four points in the history of the Ryder.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball games, they had a more persuasive victory before Woods and the newer American Bryson Dechambeau with point 5&4.
Woods fought two games on Saturday and sometimes there were moments of blade, but so far, you lost 19/29 games in fourballs and foursome series, including seven consequences.
Justin Rose, after resting in the morning fourball fights, came back with Henrik Stenson in foursome battles, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, two golfers are classing first and three in the world, with 2-1.
Although the Southwest weather in Paris is extremely comfortable, however, the European Teams have no easy day of competition.
Goons have won three big times Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas have set a major mark for the American team with two points on Saturday.
They won 2&1 persuaded Spanish, Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourball battle, and then they continued to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with four-and-3 in foursome battles, although they missed the first two holes.
In Ryder's history, only two times a team is led before four points can start the single fights, though, the Furyk team just keeps the tight.
After only being considered the second stand in two days, Sunday is likely to become the backline for this team.
North Korea declares "no way" unwise revenge without faith.
The Korean Prime Minister spoke to the United Nations on Saturday, asserting that the punishments are still maintaining deeper their doubts against the United States and in this situation, there is no way that this country is alone removing the nuclear weapons.
Mr. Ri Yong Ho spoke during the annual meeting of the United Nations Council, saying that Korea has done "very good will" during the last year, such as stopping nuclear experiments and missiles, disabling nuclear testing facilities, and commitment not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"Of course, we don't see the same move from the United States," he said.
"If we can't trust the U.S., we won't be confident that our national security will be secure, and in such a situation, there's no way we're alone in front of ourselves."
Even though Mr. Ri repeats Korea's familiar complaint about Washington’s denial of nuclear weapons, and the Koreans are going to benefit from the corresponding benefit of each step, his comments have a noteworthy point of denying the single reduction of nuclear weapons, such as Ping Xinxang still denied before.
Ri mentioned a common statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit of the United States president and a Korean leader in Singapore on July 12, in this statement, Kim commits effort to “decome the nuclear weapons on the Korean island, ” while Trump promised security for Korea.
Korea is still trying to find a official way to end Korean war in 1950-53, but the United States insists that Ping Angang has to give up the nuclear weapons first.
Washington also protested the appeals to relieve the intensity of international punishments against Xiyang.
"The investigation of "deminding nuclear weapons first" and increased the pressure of punishment to achieve a purpose in a forced way, even against the "designation of war", Mr. Ri said.
"The point that refusal can cause us to fall on our knees is just a mysterious dream of those who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the punishments that are still maintaining are still going to lose our trust."
Ri did not mention the second summitation plans between President Kim and the president of the United States, as shown at the beginning of the United Nations.
Instead, the prime minister mentioned three meetings between President Kim and the Korean President Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the party negotiates the issue of nuclear disarming is Korea, not America, the Korean nuclear dispute negotiation is not going to be closed."
Yet, Mr. Ri's voice was different from last year, when he told the council that Korean launching missiles into the United States continent was inevitable in a suicide mission after the Trump President Kim called Mr. Kim as "the missile."
Last year in the United Nations, Mr. Trump threatens to kill Korea, but this year's overwhelming thanksgiving Kim for taking the brave steps for the armor, but Mr. Trump also emphasizes that there's a lot of work to be done and the refusing resources are still to be kept out until the Korea releases the nuclear weapons.
In Wednesday, TT. Trump said he didn't set time for this: "Two years, three years or just five months aren't going to matter."
China and Russia claim that the United Nations Security Council should commend peace for their efforts.
However, the U.S. Secretary Mike Pompeo on Thursday said to the United Nations Security Council, "The Safety Council's punishments must continue strongly and unsuccessfully until we can confirm the total nuclear results, finally, with evidence."
The Security Council has agreed to increase the punishments for Korea since 2006 to finance the funds for the rocket missiles and nuclear programs of Ping Xiangyang.
Prime Minister Pompeo was conferenced with the official meeting of the United Nations Council and said he was going to visit Ping Xiang again in the next month to prepare for the second summit.
Mr. Pompeo has been visiting Korea three times this year, but the result of the last visit isn't very good.
He left Ping Angyan after the visit in July and said that the negotiation had made certain progress, but just hours later, North Korea accused the prime minister of the "requiring demands like the black society."
Korea commits a meeting with the President of the Korean President Moon Jae-In this month to remove a fire test base and a nuclear compound if the U.S. has a similar reaction.
He said President Kim directed that "samathly," that he was looking for, was the security guarantee that Trump was committing in the Singapore Conference and progressing to normalization of relationships with Washington.
Harvard students attended a full resting course.
In the effort to fight cultures that practice pressure machines, with the "night owl" drinks water, a new school at Harvard University this year has encouraged all college students to sleep more.
Students who study at the university number one world often don't know the basic knowledge of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, the professor of medical sleep at Harvard University, and expert at Women's Hospital and Brigham, who designed this course, and he himself believed that this was the first class of this kind in America.
Inspiration to begin this course came after he attended a talk about the effects of sleeplessness for the study process.
'After the end of the conversation, a student came to me and said, 'Why do you know this until the last year?'
She said that no one told her about the importance of sleep, this really surprised me,' he shared with The Telegraph.
The classroom is introduced for the first time this year, explaining to the students the importance of good sleeping habits that improve their learning and sports, and also how to improve their general health.
Paul Barreira, the psychiatrist at the University of Harvard and the director of medical services in the university, said that the school decided to introduce this course after discovered that the student had a serious sleepout during the week.
The one-fashioned course includes a series of interactive missions.
In a part of the dorm room image, where students can click on the coffee cup, the curtain, the machine, and the book to learn the effects of the caffeine, the light, and the sleepless state affect the result of sports training, as well as the importance of making the habit of sleeping at the right time.
In another part, participants learn how long - lasting sleeping conditions can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Later, the map of university campus, with interactive symbols, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know that this course can't immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe that you have the right to know -- like you have the right to influence health in choosing smoking, Professor Czeisler adds.
He said, "The Night Flowing Culture" is still in existence, and modern technology and increasing pressure to students that leads to sleeplessness is a more serious problem.
Ensured sleeping enough, good sleep quality should become the student's secret weapon to fight the stress, exhaust and anxiety -- even to avoid increased weight, because lack of sleeping causes the brain to fall into starvation, which leads us to continuous hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in California who studied biology, chemistry, and physics, helped Professor Czeisler to design this course, and he joined one of the classes last year in Harvard.
He said that the course helped him to ‘ stamp out his eyes ’ and inspired him to try to inspire him to organize an entire school course.
He was hoping that the next step would be to offer all students after college to join a similar school program before they started competing in the main course.
Professor Czeisler suggests that the students should consider when they put their sleeping-time alerts, when they wake up, and that they need to realize the effects of the green light produced from the electronic screen and the LED lights, which can cause your biological cycle disorder, which leads to difficulty sleeping.
Menga defeated Gerrard's boys.
Rangers had a day of unsuccessful competition when Dolly Menga turned Steven Gerrard's team down with the number one-0 before Livingston.
The Ibrox headquarters hoped to mark the first winning from winning 4-1 at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team made a second defeat in 18 games as coach, stretching about eight points away from the Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Menga maintained the attack seven minutes before the end of the first round, but the Rangers' gas seemed never screwed.
Rangers now fell down on the sixth position, while Livingston climbed up to the third position and just after Hibernian's desk disguise.
And Rangers had to deal with another problem after Calum Spence's editor had to treat the head wound after a certain object was thrown from the top of the guest court.
Gerrard has changed the eight-three formation against the team that passed Ayr to get into the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt kept the whole Livi 11 together and got one point before the Hearts team last week, and he must have been very happy with the way his students were surrounded by their opponents during each attack.
Although Rangers hold more balls, Livingston is the one who's really the one who's in danger of having balls.
They should have recorded the table only two minutes after Menga first blowing Scott Pittman into the yard, attacking Allan McGregor's wallet but this guard missed the chance.
A deep hit of Keaghan Jacobs took the ball to the foot of Craig Halkett, but underground Alan Lithgow can only put the shadows behind the frame.
Rangers take control of the balls on the yard, but their game is mainly based on hope more than faith, especially for a third time at the end of the battle.
Alfredo Morelos certainly claimed that you had to get the penalty on the temple point because you and Steven Lawless had happened in a case but the Steven Thomson rejected this Colombian player's appeal.
Rangers only had two hits in the first round, but the former master of Ibrox Liam Kelly had no hardship with Lassana Coulibaly's head attack and Ovie Ejaria's revolt.
While Livi's opening number in the 34th minute was considered profit, no one could deny that their victory was completely worth it.
Again, Rangers couldn't handle Jacobs' deep twerp.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher hit Scott Robinson, and Scott calmly picked Menga to make a simple end.
Gerrard immediately had the option in vacation time, by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and changing this person almost gave the implications when the player runs this wing hits Morelos, but Kelly was impressed by immediately preventing the shadow.
But Livingston succeeded in getting the team to play the same way that they wanted, when Lithgow and Halkett were going through long lines.
Holt's team had a chance to go ahead in the last minute of the game, but I'm sorry, McGregor has chosen the right position to stop Jacobs before Lithgow's heads spread from the corner.
The new player into the Glenn Middleton court of Rangers continues to complain to the courts after breaking Jacobs, but again he's rejected by Thomson.
The inventor of the Geiger Counter
On September 30th, 1882, 136 years ago and the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger born in Germany.
Geiger developed a way of detecting and measureing radiation, inventing the basis for the Geiger Counter device.
Since then, the Geiger Counter is not only a science pillar but also a pillar of great culture, for example, a conversation in the movie "Bells of Coronado", the project in 1950, with the participation of scientists and the king of Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man: "What is this?"
Rogers: "This is Geiger Counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these ears, you can actually hear the effects of radioactive atoms in the minerals."
Evans: "That's right, there's a scream from here!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63th birthday.
However, the invention of your name remains for time.
Cancer addicts can teach the immune system how broken cell attacks are.
Cancer vaccine can teach the immune system how the cells are damaged and destroyed.
Immunication instructs the system to identify cells that are broken during the treatment.
This method includes taking immune cells from the patient, changing cells in the lab.
And then these cells can look at the common protein in many cancers and be reinjected into the body.
A kind of test vaccine is giving positive results in different cancer patients.
A woman who was treated with vaccine taught the immune system to realize that cells were broken and her egg cancer cells disappeared after more than 18 months.
This method includes taking immunogen cells from the patient, changing cells in the lab, so that these cells can "see" the common protein in many cancers, called HER2, and then the cells are injected into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the United States’s Ung Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, says, "Our research shows that we're in the hands of a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "increasing the development of some kind of cancer," including breast cancer, eggs, lungs, and lungs, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar study method, taking immunogen cells from the patient's body and teaching them how to target cancer cells, which used to work in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye received a lot of stones when she showed crazy support to TT. Trump, the MAGA hat after Saturday Music Night.
Things don't work.
Kanye West received a lot of loud voices in the election room during the SNL Night, after his draft show, he praised the American President Donald Trump and claimed he was going to run in 2020.
After performing the third song, Ghost Town, wearing the hat Make America Great Again, he was angry with the Democratic Party and claimed to support TT. Trump.
"So many times I talked to white friends, they said, "Why do you like Trump, he's a racist?"
If I'm worried about racists, I've been out of America." He said.
SNL started the program with Matt Damon's assessment, and in this Hollywood star sarcophaged Brett Kavanaugh's sworn oath for the Senate of the Justice Committee of Christine Blasey Ford's sexual assaults.
Although the program wasn't broadcasted, the West's angry speech recorded was posted on the social network called Chris Rock.
It is not clear that Rock deliberately ridiculed West when he posted this article.
Moreover, West complained to the audience that he was uncomfortable behind the chicken wings because of his hat.
"They bullied me in the backstage.
They said, "Don't play with that hat."
They bullied me!
Then they said I was swamped," he shared, according to Washington Examiner.
West goes on, "Do you know what it's swamp?" He claims to "shake my hero's icon hat, because no one can force me to do anything.
"Love."
His comments made the audience scream at least two times, and members of the SNL were confusing, a sharer said, "The whole revenue is dead."
West was chosen to replace Ariana Grande, because your boyfriend, Rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West makes a lot of people confused with the I Love it, in the dress like a Chai Perrier.
West received the support of the head of the TPUS Conservation Group, Candace Turner, who once posted on the Twitter page:
But the program director Karen Hunter posted on Twitter is West simply "just acting according to his nature, and this is really great."
"But I choose not to reward someone (by buying his music products or dresses, or supporting his art) because I believe that he's chasing and propagating the sense of the system is not good for my community.
He has freedom.
So do we," she added.

China reports the number of infected people up to 14%.
China has just published the number of citizens living with HIV and Aids has increased 14%.
The medical authorities say that this country has over 820,000 people who have this disease.
The number of infections were noted only in two quarters in 2018 alone was 400,000.
Most of the infections are sexually infectioned.
In the past, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China because of blood transfusions.
However, the number of HlV infected on this road has dropped almost equal to zero, which is a statement by the Chinese medical officials at a convention in Yuan Nam province.
However, the number of people who have to live with HIV and Aids in China has increased to 100,000 people annually.
HIV contamination through sex is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
Although homosexuality is no longer considered legally in China since 1997, in fact, the behavior of the LGBT community is still common.
Because of the conservative values of this country, study estimates that 70-90 percent of men are finally married, even though they have developed sex with men.
Many have been infected with the centuries - old disease because they do not use full protection in homosexuality.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has committed HIV treatment to all infected patients to cope with this disease.
Mrs. Maxine Waters denied her employees to reveal the data of the Republican senators, to emphasize the 'defense lies' and 'conspiracy'.
On Saturday, the American Democratic Party, Maxine Waters, rejected the accusation that a member of your staff had published personal information from three Republican senators on the Wikipedia page about the legalists.
The Democratic Party in Los Angeles claimed that these complaints were "righteous" experts and websites organized.
"Lies, lies, and more scornful lies," said Waters in an article on Twitter.
According to the report, the leak information included a home address and the phone number by the United States Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, from Utah.
These information began to appear on the Internet on Thursday, by an unidentified person at the Capitol Hill House during the Senate's hearing of sexual assaults against the candidate for the Supreme Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
This information was revealed a short time after these three Senators inquired Kavanaugh.
The Hill magazine wrote: The network sites of conservative sides like Gateway Pundit and Red State report that the IP address identifies the origin of posts related to Mrs. Waters' office and reveals information about one of Mrs. Waters' employees.
Mrs. Waters continues to say, "This unbaptized compound is completely untruthful and absolute lie."
"The officers in my office have been invasionated identity, personal information, and safety of these false and misguided accusations could not have revealed those information.
This unbaptized compound is completely untruthful and absolute lie."
Waters’s statement immediately attracted online criticism, including the former newspaper secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"Admiration of this refusal shows anger," wrote Fleischer.
"This shows that she had no gas to become congress committee.
When someone is accused of a behavior that is not done, it should not be angry.
They're not challenged.
They don't question the motives of the accuser.
They have to show calmness and soundness."
Fleischer seems to be compared with the Waters reaction of Judge Kavanaugh to the critics of the Democratic Party and the critics also accused him of being too angry at the day of Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running into the Waters place during the middle election, also expressing his views on Twitter.
"Big if true" (May it be if it's true), he wrote on Twitter.
Mrs. Waters claims that her office warns the authorities and the authorities of the law enforcement of these misguided charges.
"We'll make sure the perpetrator will be given light," she continues to say, "and they're going to be responsible for all the actions that can damage and danger with any of my employees."
Assess Johnny English to the Humorless Agent of Rowan Atkinson.
Now, there's a pretty traditional trend in any new film that has an English element is looking for the meaning of Brexit, and the next practice of the motion series of Johnny English spies isn't an exception.
Will we act smilingly on our own subject become a new chance of exporting this country?
Anyway, detective Johnny English is restricted with round-eyed eyes and the genius are allowed to blow things up again -- his name simply represents a comic work designed for areas that do not speak English.
Of course, he was a secret acting agent, although he always pretended duck in the style of Detective Clouseau, mixed Mr. Bean's humor and something contributed to the title of the Chariots of Fire in the initiating London Olympic Ages in 2012.
The agent's prototype is also based on the tourist and the international mysterious man that Atkinson used to be in a TV advertising Barclaycard has now sunk into forgotten and causing the chaos when he wakes up.
There are some pretty interesting scenes in the latest Johnny English film.
I like the Johnny English approaching the helicopter while wearing the middle-around armor and the fans hit his hat.
Although Atkinson's humor is fully manifested, the humor factor here seems to be not enough and a little extraterrestrial, especially when movies like 007 movies and unexpected tasks have made the dynasty only a kind of taste.
The funny thing in this movie can only make a kid laugh, I myself assume that Johnny English's stupid mistakes are not creative and interesting as the joke in the dumb movie of Mr. Bean of Atkinson.
The situation leads the story is that England is in serious trouble.
Tinker invaded the British super secret agent network, revealed the identity of all British agents who are working outside, which leads to the loss of an agent who's working on the mission, an awful little role of Kevin Eldon.
This is the final chance of the Prime Minister, a proud and strong character, who is now facing this political crisis: Emma Thompson has shown greatly the version of the Prime Minister Teresa May, but, according to the dramatic, she has not had a lot of land performing.
Intelligence counselors report that the identity of all the operating agents has been exposed and you're going to have to have to move an undetermined agent.
And that guy's Johnny English, now teaching in a country, but in fact, teaching lessons out of the program to become a secret agent: there are some pretty interesting jokes here, because the English teaches students to be spies in the way of a Rock Academy.
English is called back to the Whitehall Court and assembled with the poor former assistant Bough, by actor Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, a woman who is a luxurious submarine commander, Vicki Pepperdine takes the role of a little waste of this talent.
So the Batman and Robins got troubled with the Queen's orders back in the mission and met Olga Kurylenko in the Beautiful Agent Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is in danger by the curse of billionaire charming technologies after claiming that he can solve all headache problems on his computer in Britain: Jason Volta is dangerous, by Jake Lacy.
The English and Bough started an adventure with fantastic clowns: after disguiseing a waitress, they burned a French restaurant in their eyes; caused a chaos on Volta's great boat; and English even got more messy when they tried to use the actual ears to explore Volta's house.
At the end of the movie, all the tight buttons will be removed, but such excitement is quite like the children's television channels.
It's a pretty common piece.
And as well as the other Johnny English part, I can't ask questions: The movie industry, the British really can't give Rowan Atkinson a fair act, worth your talent?
The Lao Party rejected the information that was building a plan for the British to work for four days but took five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Lao Party will consider an advanced plan, allowing the English people to work four days a month, but pay five days a month.
According to the information, the party wants the entrepreneur to transfer the savings of money by the artificial intelligence revolution to the employees by giving them another day off.
That means the employees get off weekend three days, but they still get the same wages.
The sources show that this idea is "combined" with this party's economic project and is expected to increase support for the worker of this country.
The British Confederation confirmed that transferring to four days per month is one way for workers to enjoy the benefit of the change of the economy.
An advanced source in the Lao Party said to the Sunday Times: "The search of the planning policy will be published at the end of this year.
'This goal can't be done in short time, but working four days per day is a ambition that matches this party's proposal for rebalanceing the economy that benefits the workers and the industrial strategies of the party.'
The Lao Party will not be the first to accept this idea.
However, this idea was not passed by the entire Lao Party.
One of the Lao speakers said, "The book that works four days a day isn't the policy of parties and parties who don't consider this policy."
Dark Prime Minister John McDonnell used the Lao Assembly last week to enhance the vision of a social revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from the "unnamed Administrators" and "defenseers" at the convenient service companies.
These dark prime ministers also mean that the sharers in the water level companies may not be able to get all their shares back because the government of the Lao Party can apply 'stage minus' based on behavior that is considered wrong.
He also confirmed the plan for the laborers to join the company management council and set up a full estate to give 10% of private companies to the employees, from which they were able to get stocks every year to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, shared in the "60 minutes" program about the FBI investigation on Kavanaugh, did they change their decision?
The FBI investigation on the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed his final vote to appoint him for the Supreme Court for at least a week and asks whether the result of the Federal Intelligence Bureau could cause any republies of the Republicans to regain support.
During a Sunday broadcast interview, Scott Pelley reporter asked the Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI found any evidence that could make these senators change their decision.
Mr. Kennedy was more open than a colleague from South Carolina Bang.
"I suppose of course," said Kennedy.
"I said in the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, which means after the charge was given and asked, "Do you do it?"
He answered very firm, decisive and decisive."
However, Graham's vote seems to be completely sure.
He said, "I've decided about Brett Kavanaugh, and there's only one charge of craftsmanship that makes me change."
"To Professor Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett has denied very strong," said Graham adds, mentioning Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all the people she told her names couldn't verify the story.
It's been 36 years ago.
I don't see anything change."
What is the global civilian festival, and does it contribute to the elimination of poverty?
This Saturday, New York will post over the Global Civil Assembly, an age - old music event with the participation of an impressive star to accomplish a mission: the end of poverty in the world.
In the seventh year of this event, the Global Civil Institute will see tens of thousands of people falling to the Great Lawn Coast of Central Park not only to enjoy Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to enhance the real purpose of ending poverty in 2030.
Global Civil Assembly, which began in 2012, was the extended part of the Globe Disease Projekt, a international movement group with hope to end poverty by increased the number of active people fighting against poverty.
To get a free ticket for this event (unless you're ready to pay for VIP tickets), the music attender must finish a series of tasks or "activity" as volunteered, send an email to a world leader, call the phone, or any other means to help improve the consciousness of the targets of poverty.
But how did this global civil celebration achieve, when it was still 12 years left to reach its goal?
The idea of a free night of music for people is a real way to convince people to call action, or just another form of "keyboard Motion" -- people feel they're making a real difference by signing online requests or posting a post on Twitter?
Since 2011, the Global Civil Institute stated that over 10 million "activities" from the listed supporters, pushing a series of different targets.
They say that these actions have motivated world leaders to make a commitment and policy that corresponds to more than 37 billion dollars, which were set in order to take steps to improve the lives of more than 2,25 billion people in 2030.
Early in 2018, the group quoted 390 commitment and announced the action of the group, at least 10 billion dollars had been refined or funded.
The estimation group to this day, the guaranteed funds have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some major commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partner organization that includes investors and those who make it, a commitment to help children develop their ability, promise to give Ruanda 25 million dollars to help stop the nutrition state in this country after getting more than 4700 Twitter posts from the global population group.
"With British support, donors, national government and global citizens like you, we can turn social injustice to nutrition into a sign of history," said the Ambassador of Nutrition Power, Tracey Ullman, shared with the audience in a direct demonstration program in London in April 2018.
This group also states that after more than 5,000 action in appealing to Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government has promoted a project called Nutrition Power, ensured nutrition for 5 million women and children.
Answers to one of the common questions on the website of the group, "What makes you believe that we can end the extreme poverty?"
Global citizens say, "This will be a long and difficult road -- sometimes we will fail.
But just as civil rights and racist movements before, we will succeed because together, we will become stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe is some of the artists who are going to play this year in New York, by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. can use the Navy to get the Russian power producer - the Secretary of Civil Service
The Washington Examiner posted the Minister of the United States of America, Ryan Zinke, reveals: Washington can stimulate the Navy forces "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy being brought into the market, including the Middle East market.
Zinke accused that Russia's participation in Syria -- more interesting than by legal government invitation -- was just an excuse to explore the new energy market.
According to the report, the man said, "I believe the reason they're invading the Middle East is because they want to trade energy like in Eastern Europe, the southeast valley of Europe."
And by official news, there are ways and ways to stop this.
He said, "The United States has the ability to use the Navy forces to ensure that the pipeline traffic is still open and will close, when necessary, to ensure their energy isn't taken into the market."
Zinke has called people to attend the event organized by the consumer's Energy Union, a group of non-profits that are "the voice of the consumer of energy" in the United States.
He continues to compare Washington's methods to Russia and Iran, and he notices that these two are the same.
"The economic project that Iran and Russia can choose is to use and change fuel," he said, while calling Russia "one powerful one" with the economy based on fossil fuel.
The claims were given when the government of TT. Trump was trying to increase the amount of natural fuel export to Europe, to replace Russia's position, to choose a lot cheaper for European consumers.
To achieve this goal, the officials of the TT. Trump, including the President of the United States, Donald Trump are trying to persuade Germany from the North Nord Stream 2 flow oil project, which according to Mr. Trump, made Moscow "in total control" Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the North Nord Stream oil project 2 is worth 11 billion dollars, which is built to double the current sugar efficiency that is 110 billion centimeters and this is a pure economic project.
The Kremlin encyclopedia reasoned that the fierce opposition from Washington towards this project simply comes from economic reasons and an example of unhealthy competition.
"I believe we have the same view that energy can't be the tool to force and consumers must be chosen to providers," said the Russian Energy Secretary Aleksandr Novak after the meeting with the American Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The United States's stand has caused a fierce reaction from Germany, and then this country reassigned to engage in the project.
Germany's main industry, the German Industry Union (BDI), called the United States not to interfere with the European Union's energy policy, as well as the parallel agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have to face a big problem when there's a third country trying to intervene in our energy supply" said Dieter Kempf, the President of the German Industry Union (BDI), after the meeting with the German Prime Minister Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

18 states and D.C. support the challenge of new refuge policy.
Eighteen states and District of Columbia are supporting the challenge of the new policy of the United States denied refugees for the victims who fled from gangs or family violence.
NBC News reports that representatives of 18 states and D.C. sent a short group text on Friday in Washington to support refugees against this policy.
They're full name in the Grace and Sessions filed by the State Liberal Union in August against the federal policy, which is still undiscovered.
She said her lover, "and the son of the members of his violent gang," abused her, but the American officials refused to ask her refuge on July 20/07.
You're held in Texas.

General Lawyer Jeff Sessions demanded that the judges who claimed to be immigrants would not continue to allow refugees to flee victims from family violence and gang abuse in June.
"just permit refuge to those who leave their country because of oppression or fear of racial, religion, nationality, or members of a particular group of society or political views," said Mr. Sessions in the report of policy on July 11/06.
There's never been a minimation of all the problems -- even the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.

The U.S. Ambassador accused China's bullying' with 'Proportions'.
A week after a official Chinese newspaper runs a four-page advertisement on a American newspaper that refers to the general benefit of U.S.-Trung United States, the U.S. Ambassador in China accused Beijing to use the U.S. press to spread.
Wednesday ago, the President Donald Trump mentioned a compensation of China Daily to Des Moines Register - the most sold newspaper of the state Iowa - after the Chinese accused China to try to intervene in the U.S. Congress election on November 6, China has rejected this charge.
The TT. Trump's compulsory about Beijing trying to intervene in the U.S. election marked a new stage in an increased campaign that pressured the China of Washington by what the American authorities shared with Reuters.
Although the foreign government's advertising commercials is perfectly normal, Peking and Washington are now trapped in a climbing business, with the evidence that they've applied high taxes to the imported cargos of the two sides.
Chinese and American experts say that China's tax policy for revenge during the beginning of the war was designed to enter the exporters in the Republicans of TT. Trump like Iowa.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. Ambassador in China and former Governor of the Iowa Bang, who produced large agriculture products to China, says Beijing has hurt the workers, farmers, and American businesses.
Branstad wrote an opinion on Des Moines Register Sunday, saying, China continues to be bullied by running advertisements on our own free newspaper."
"To propagate, the Chinese government is using the U.S. freedom of speech and free press tradition when he puts a payment ad on the Des Moines register," wrote Branstad.
"Perfectly, at the paper sales on the streets of Beijing, you very rarely find a dispute perspective and will not see any real reflection of the different Chinese opinions about China's difficult economic orbit, because obviously the media is completely controlled by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also added that "one of the most popular newspapers of China avoided his posting suggestion," although he didn't tell you exactly what newspaper it was.
The analysts warn the Republicans are getting the voters away from before the middle election with Kavanaugh's job.
When many Republicans stand up to protect the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh before a few sexual attacks, the analysts warn that they may be under severe response, especially from women, in the upcoming election.
The emotions around this case are pretty strong and most of the Republican candidates on the list are showing that they want to keep on voting.
There are things we can't do again," said Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Maxwell University of Syracuse University who told The Hill in a article published on Saturday.
Mr. Reeher said that he didn't think that Senator Jeff Flake (Bang R-Arizona) pressed the yes button for the FBI to perform investigation enough to soothe the angry voters.
The Washington newspaper, D.C., led Karine Jean-Pierre, a high-end counselor and national spokesman of the MoveOn Friday: "The women won't forget what happened yesterday -- tomorrow they won't forget, and in November, they're not forgetting."
Mic reports: Friday morning, the protesters shouted, "November 11 is coming!" as they marched on the Senate's hall because the Republicans are under control of the Justice Committee, which has chosen to continue vote for the Kavanaugh, regardless of Professor Christine Blasey Ford's statement.
"Democracy and Democrat motives will be pushed higher than ever," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partial political analyst shared with the news page.
"It is said that this motivation is now very high; yes.
But maybe even higher, especially among the women's voters in the suburbs and young voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, they don't vote because they don't like the president."
Even before Mrs. Ford publicly denounced the details of sexual assaults against the almighty judge, the experts say that the public might have a powerful response if the Republicans continue to confirm.
NBC News directed Michael Steele, former Republican National Committee, said last week: "This can become a mess that the Republicans have to deal with."
"The problem is not just vote of the committee or official vote, or that Kavanaugh becomes the Supreme Court, but the matter is more important than the way the Republicans handle the accommodations and the way they treat the accusers," said Guy Cecil, the director of Priorities the United States, the democratic Party supporter, talking to the news.
The American people, however, had a disagreement about trusting in Ford or Kavanaugh’s statement, seemingly a lot more suspected by Mr. Kavanaugh.
A new poll that youGov organized shows that 41 percent of the people who responded strongly or may believe in Ford's statement, while 35 percent said that they were certain or could trust Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent of the responders thought that Kavanaugh could or certainly lie when he gave a statement, while only 30 percent thought that Ford was certain or might have lied.
After Flake pressed the concert button, the FBI was running Mrs. Ford's charges and at least another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian.
Ford sworn to the Senate's Justice Committee last week that Kavanaugh attacked her with drunkenness, when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez accused the candidate of the Supreme Court who revealed his sexual part in front of her when they attended a party during the school time in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to start building a new Internet to get Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of World Wide Web, is now launching a business start project, for the goal of competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend is called Inrupt, a building company based on the source of Solid by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows the user to choose where the data is stored and what rights are given to access any information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said that the plan behind the Inrupt project was "the world rule."
"We have to start now," he said about this business start.
"Now it's history."
The application using Solid technology, allowing users to create their own "online personal data" or POD.
This data can include a list of contacts, a list of jobs to do, a calendar, a music library, a personal and other professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all available on a browser and display at the same time.
The unique thing about this online personal data store is the full-powered user decides who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it "to control the data for personal."
According to the CEO of the company, John Bruce, the idea of the Inrupt project is to ensure the company’s resources, procedures, and skills to provide Solid for everyone.
There's a company with Berners-Lee, Bruce, a secure foundation that IBM bought back, some developers signed the contract to work in the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the globe can create their own non-concentrated applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not discuss "Facebook and Google about the change that happened completely because all of their business models could be fully upgraded after one night.
"We don't need to ask for permission."
In an article on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote, "The destiny of Inrupt is to provide commercial energy and a ecosystem that protects the complete and quality of the new site built on Solid foundations."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when the World Wide Web Association was established at Massachusetts Technology Institute.
In recent months, Berners-Lee is a powerful name in a debate about the neutrality of the Internet.
Although introduction to the Inrupt project, Berners-Lee will continue to serve as the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web, Web Foundation and Data Institute.
"I'm extremely optimistic about the next era of the web," added Berners-Lee.

Michael Vann, 72 years old, said his grandfather's action was "the action I'm never able to do, but there's humility."
You and your brother, Dr. James Vann, also set a flower roof after the Royal Brentwood Concert march.
Michael Vann says that he feels "very honored to be joined in the parade" and "the courage of a true hero will be recognized by the support of a lot of people."
The martial art fans all night to see Bellator 206, but they finally only get Peppa Pig.
Imagine you've been awake all night waiting to see Bellator 206 with a tight audience, but eventually you're rejected to see the main event.
The presentation from San Jose said there were 13 games, including six games on the main card, and were directed throughout the night in England on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., as soon as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were ready to fight, the watcher in England was shocked when the screen turned into Pig.
Some feel unrespectful after they get close to the morning to see the game.
A fan said on Twitter that turning the program into an artificial child's cartoon like "a charming joke."
"The government decrees that the art content is inappropriate at 6:00 a.m., so they have to be converted into the children's program," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's high president of the marketing and media.
"Peppa the sea," yes."
President of Bellator Company, Scott Coker says they're looking at a broadcast schedule to make sure the British audience can see the future show.
Mr. Coker says, "I think we can solve the problem if we give it back."
"But on that side is 6:00 Sunday morning and we can't handle the problem until Sunday by our time, but it's Monday by their hours.
But we're trying to find a solution.
Believe me, when people change the program, there's a lot of messages back and those messages aren't very friendly.
We tried to fix it, we initially thought it was technical problem.
But eventually, it's not, it's a government rule.
I can promise you that this won't happen next time.
We're going to decrease the number of fights for five, instead of six games that we were expecting early -- the number of fights we usually provided and we've tried to give overwhelming fans.
This is a really unfortunate situation."
The Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'thua' about sexual trends.
The Olympic Adventure Tom Daley shared that when he grew up, he always felt less than people because of his sexual tension -- but that was his successful motivation.
The 24-year-old athletes shared me didn't realize "I'm not like anybody" until I studied in school.
Conversation in the Desert Island Discs of the 4th tower led by Lauren Laverne, he said that he had been speaking about the rights of homosexuals to bring hope to others.
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning at the Olympic Olympics.
The rice director of this long - term program, Kirsty Young, took a few months to nurture.
One of the first ones led by Laverne, Daley appeared as a abandoned man, saying that he felt "thua poor" everybody, because "Your personality is unacceptable as a son and a daughter."
He said, "To this day, feels about the feeling that I've lost and the difference still existed, becomes the motivation and strength that I can succeed."
You want to prove that you had something to do so people don't be disappointed to know the truth about your sexual tendencies.
This olympic medal advocate has become a positive advertiser for the LGBT community and he uses his image at the United States of Swan Sport in Australia this year to call more countries against homosexuals.
He told himself that he was very lucky to be able to live open without distinction and to bring "hope" to others.
Three times the world champion shared that you loved a man -- American film producer Dustin Lance Black.
Daley was married to the winner of Oscar than I was 20 years old last year, but he said that the age disguise has never been interrupted between you two.
"When you're suffering too much when you're young" -- you're at the Olympic Olympics at the first time when you're 14 and your father died for cancer three years later -- it's very hard to find someone who's the same age as each of them experience a depression in your life.
The couple became the parents of the boy Robert Ray Black-Daley in June and Daley said that your "world" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, my goal was, "I must win the gold medal," he said.
"But you know, there's more important than the Olympic gold medal.
My olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 when he was 40 years old after diagnosed brain cancer.
Daley said that his father didn't accept the fact that he was dying and one of the last things he asked was that they had tickets for the Soviet Union in London in 2012 -- because he wanted to sit on the front seat.
"I couldn't tell him," he said.
"I hold his hand when he takes his last breath and even until he stops breathing and leaves forever, I can't finally admit that he has to be invincible."
The next year, Daley fought at the Olympic Olympics in 2012 and won the medal.
"I only know that it's my whole life's dream -- dancing in front of the promotion crowd in Olympic Olympic, really no more feeling," he said.
This is also an inspiration to you to choose Heather Small's first song -- the Supreme Heather Small -- the song with you during your training to the Olympics and still touching you every time you hear it.

Mickelson's lack of graduation on the back seat was done by Ryder's doll on Saturday.
The American Golf Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Cup Ryder game, but he'll have to raise his style to avoid this record to become a sad experience.
Mickelson played in the two-year-old event, 12 times, but Captain Jim Furyk left him to sit on a seat in the Fourball and Foursome Saturday.
Instead of being the center of acting like in the United States, the five winnings have to spend the whole day playing cheerleader and playing the game with the hope of getting out of an awkward feeling.
The 48-year-old Golf National Golf National Golf National is never an ideal choice for the top of the high level, because the wrong hits here are going to suffer severe consequences.
And if this golf field isn't obsessed enough, Mickelson's got to fight on Sunday's 9th fight against the British Championship of the British Championship Enabling Francesco Molinari, this week, Molinari caught up with the newer Tommy Fleetwood and won all four games.
If the U.S. team, is now losing four points before we start a 12-sequent single fight that wants to start in a impressive way, Mickelson's game is important.
Furyk showed confidence in his golfmen and didn't talk too much.
"He understands his role today, he claps me in the back, his arms over me and says he'll be ready for tomorrow."
"He's very confident.
He's a legend and has contributed a lot to the team, in the past and in the whole week.
I may never have imagined he played two games.
I imagine more, but that's how things happen and we think it's the right way.
He wants to fight, like all the other teammates."
This Sunday, Mickelson will cross Nick Faldo's record, become the most competition in Ryder's doll.
That could also be the sign of his career at Ryder's Doubt because the tops of your personal record have never appeared in this tournament.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 fights and peace, even though Furyk claims that his presence has an invisible value for the team.
"He's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny," he explained.
"I think young golfmen are happy to meet him and this week is quite fun.
What he's dedicated is more than a competition."
Captain of the European Team Thomas Bjorn knew that the advantages could quickly disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, European Reaching Captain, has experienced that even though our team has a lot ahead of us as we walk into the final winner of the Ryder season, the results can be easily reversed in a very uncomfortable way.
The Dane started to fight in 1997 in Valderrama, where their team, under the leadership of Seve Ballesteros, leads five points ahead of the United States, but finally wins a close match with the 14⁄2-165.
"You always have to remind yourself that we've been leading a lot in Valderrama; we've been leading a lot in Brookline and we lose, in Valderrama, we win, but we're very tight," said Bjorn, with the face that's pictured after watching the 2018 class of 2018 with the winning of 5-3 on Friday and leading to 10-6 on the last night on the Le Golf National.
So the history will show me and everyone in the team that it's not over.
You still have to focus your mind on tomorrow.
To the yard and tournament is good.
The tournament is not over when the score is not on the board.
We have the goal of winning this year and that's our focus.
I always say that I focus on my 12 golfers, but we also understand the power of the team -- they are the best golfers in the world."
Björn adds: "I'll never tell you anything.
Tomorrow will be another war.
Tomorrow is the display of individuals and it will certainly be very different.
It would be great to compete with pairs and things go fine, but when you fight a personal fight, all the chances of a golfman will be exposed.
That's the message you have to share with every golfer, that they have to be ready to fight the best tomorrow.
Now a couple of competitions have to be separated and each one of you must be ready to fight the best."
In contrast with Bjorn, the captain of the opponent, Jim Furyk expects his genius to show his own abilities better than playing with pairs, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas have won three points in four points.
Furyk himself had been through both directions in the last day, being a winner member in Brookline before failure while the European team was spitting "Slave in Medinah."
"I remember every single word" he said when asked about Ben Crenshaw, the captain of the team in 1999, how he gathered and encouraged the gangsters before the last day of the competition.
"We have 12 important fights tomorrow, but you'll want to start quickly as you see in Brookline, or as you see in Medinah.
When the results are following a trend, the fights in the middle are going to suffer a lot of pressure.
We built the team that way and sent golfers to the courtyard strategicly and tried to make a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to lead the recruit team and confronted Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, other European genius in the first series of games.
"I choose this group, in that order because I believe that it's the way to go through." Bjorn said about the choice for his single fight.
German new warship continues to be delayed in use.
The local media informed: the German Navy latest axis would have been running in 2014 to replace the old Cold War, but at least the next year would have been able to run the test by the system of errors and increase costs.
The Die Zeit directs military speaker: "Rheinland-Pfalz", "Rheinland-Pfalz," the leadership of the axis is completely new with Baden-Wuerttemberg, which is now delayed to the beginning of 2019.
This ship was supposed to be delegated to the Navy in 2014, but the problems after delivering have hindered this ambition.
Four ships of Baden-Wuerttemberg that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the old Bremen axis.
This means that these ships will be equipped with a strong firearms, a series of empty deflectors, and a number of invisible technologies, such as decreasing radars, infrared and sounds.
Other important features include longer maintaining - can develop the latest axis ships far away from national ports to two years.
However, the continuous delay means that these modern war ships - assumed to help Germany control the foreign countries - will become backward at the start of use, noticed Die Zeit.
Unfortunately the F125 Axis became the headline last year when the German Navy officially refused to run and returned to the Blohm & Voss train plant in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the shipwork after delivering.
There's very little information about the reason behind returning this ship, but the German media refers to the "responsive software and hardware", which leads to a completely useless battleship if we engage in a battle mission.
The application misinterpretary is very serious because the Baden-Wuerttemberg ship is going to be made by a 120 sailor -- just half of the forces on the old Bremen axis.
At the same time, it can be seen that the weight of the ship is significantly rising, which reduces efficiency and restricts the upgrade in the future of the Navy.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" ship weighs 7,000 tons, which are supposed to be double the same war ship that the Germans used in World War II.
In addition to the hardware failed, the cost of the whole project -- including training the crew -- is also a serious problem.
The project is supposed to have been incredibly compiled to 3,1 billion euros -- while the initial estimate cost is 2,2 billion.
The issue of the latest axis has become especially important, in the recent context, warnings about German naval powers are becoming increasingly narrow.
Beginning this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the president of the German Congress of Defense Committee, admits the Navy really "fightable ship."
This official says that the problem became increasingly severe in time, because the old ship has stopped working but there is no replacement.
He complained that there were no ships among the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships qualified to join the Navy.
The National Trust Organization listens to the secret life of bats.
A new study is being conducted in a scotland area to reveal how bats use natural visions to hunt food.
Hopefully, these discoveries will lighten the behavior of this unique flying mammal and direction for future preserved activities.
This study was made by scientists of National Trust For Scotland, tracking the journey of popular bats, mosquito bats, brown ears and Daubenton at the Inverewe Garden of Wester Ross.
Special recordings will be placed in important positions around the research area to monitor the activity of these bats during the season.
NHS officers and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveillances with a hand surveillance.
The audio analyst will proceed to analyze all the records and determine the frequency of bats and the purpose to sound the sound of every particular bat.
Then, the map and the report of the living environment of bats will be built to have a detailed picture of the nature of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS's natural preservation counselor, hopefully the result will help to determine which life zone has the most important role of bats and every species living in that environment.
This information will help to determine the benefits of living environmental activities, such as planting pastures, and the best way to preserve the forest for bats and other related species.
The bat pants in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have been significantly declined in the past century.
They are threatened by building and developing activities that affect the bat's beans and the lost environment.
The wind and the light system, the fly snare, some chemical processing methods for building materials, as well as the attacks of pet cats can cause risks for bats.
Swimming isn't completely blind.
However, because of the habit of hunting at night, the ears are more useful than the eyes when they watch and catch prey.
They use a technique that identifies a very brilliant sound to identify obstacles on the flying road.
NTS is responsible for over 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 ha land in the country, and especially respecting bats.
The organization has ten specialists trained regularly to perform surveys, tests, and sometimes to engage in animal rescues.
This organization even established the first and only scotland bat preserve area in Threaveland in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the living place of eight of the ten Scotland bats.
Manager of the land, David Thompson said that the land was their ideal territory.
"Threave is a great living environment for bats" he said.
"We have a lot of old buildings, a lot of trees and a good environment.
But there's still a lot of mystery about bats, so the work here and in other facilities will help us to understand more about what the bat needs to develop."
He emphasized the importance of testing the lives of bats before preserving in the fields, because accidentally destroying their breeding beans could kill more than 400 children and the nausea, almost completely destroy the entire population.
Battle is a protected species and killing, harassing, disturbing or destroying their beans is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scotland Reserve Fund agent, encouraged the community to participate in the help.
She said, "We still need to learn more about bats and with many species, we can't know how far they are from each other."
Ronaldo rejected his rape charges and his lawyers prepared to sue Germany magazines.
Cristiano Ronaldo says that the sexual accusations against you are "faithful" and someone who wants to profit" with your name.
Your lawyer is about to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel for posting this charge.
The Portuguese money is now playing for the Juventus team being accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in the hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
The Der Spiegel posted Friday: this player is supposed to pay this woman $375,000 to keep quiet about the case.
In the live video on Instagram before 142 million people followed a few hours after the charge was published, Ronaldo, 33 years old, claiming that it was "false news."
"No, no, no.
What they say today is all false news," the five players get the gold ball before the cameras.
"They want to use my name to profit.
That's normal.
Telling my name they're famous, but it's just part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's good," said the male man to add and smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyer is preparing to the Japanese Der Spiegel for this charge, they call it "the unacceptable suspicion of personal life."
Attorney Christian Schertz said that this player would ask for compensation by "the moral damages that correspond to the serious amount of invasion, perhaps one of the most serious violations on personal rights in recent years."
The case in charge was supposed to happen in June 2009 in a high-level vacation room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the club, Ronaldo and Mayorga were supposed to have returned to this player's vacation room, according to the file at the Clark District Court of Nevada, he was accused of raping her at the hotel.
Mayorga says that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the accused and said he "99%" was "good", but "1%" wasn't good.
There's a document that Ronaldo confirms that both sides have sexual relations, but they're based on agreement.
Mayorga also said she went to the police station and was taken back the wounds at the hospital, but then she agreed to reconcile outside the court because she was "revengeed" and worried because "publicly insulted."
This 34-year-old woman says that she's now trying to reverse the decision of reconciliation because she's still being traumad by the charges.
At the time of the charge, Ronaldo was prepared to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid, but at the end of this summer, he moved to play for the Italian giant Juve in a 100 million-dollar contract.
Brexit: I'll've always regret it for losing the car producer's position.
The Secretary of Greg Clark says that the Britain will always regret if he loses the world’s leadership of the pregnancy Brexit car production.
He also added that it's quite nervous when Toyota UK shares with BBC that if you leave the European Union without any further deal, they'll stop working at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car producer says that the delays at the border in the case of Brexit without a deal can lead to losing his job.
The Burnaston factory - the Auris and the Avensis of Toyota - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, which 90 percent were exported to other countries in the European Union.
"My point is that if you completely leave the European Alliance in March, we'll have to stop producing at this factory," Marvin Cooke, the director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other vehicle producers in Britain also worry about leaving the EU without a border trade deal, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW said they would close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of automakers is the risk of supplying the case of Brexit without another deal.
Toyota's manufacture chain operates in principle "just-in-time" (just-time), with the parts that are supplied in Britain and the European Union are transferred after every 37 minutes for the production vehicles in order.
If you leave the EU without any other deal on November 29, there's a possibility of interruption at the border, and this industry is concerned that it can lead to delay and disappointment.
Toyota says that this company can't keep the storage value over a day at the Derbyshire factory, so they're going to have to stop producting.
Mr. Clark says that the Chequers plan of the Prime Minister Theresa May for future relationships with the European Alliance will be "exactly adjusted to avoid checking at the border."
"We need a deal, we want the best deal, not only guarantee success in the present, but also make sure that we catch this good opportunity," he said in the Today's BBC Channel 4.
"The evidence from Toyota as well as other car producers shows that we need to make sure the supply continues successful."
Toyota hasn't made sure to stop production for long, but regardless of how long, they warn that increase costs will reduce the competitive capacity of factory and eventually the workers will lose their job.
Peter Tsouvallaris worked at Burnaston for 24 years and was the one who called Unite Company at the factory, saying that his members were getting more anxious: "The experience of my experience once they lost these jobs never got again.
The government spokesman claims, "We have built an accurate and reliable plan for relationship with the European Union in the future."
The White House announced the meeting between TT. Trump and Mr. Rosenstein can be delayed again.
The White House announced on Sunday: the TT's high-end meeting with the Commissioner Rod Rosenstein could be "a week later" when the fight on the candidate of the president of the Supreme Judge Brett Kavanaugh is on.
Rosenstein supervises Robert Mueller's special counselor's work, who's investigating an intervention in the Russian election, linking the assistants of TT. Trump and Russia, and the possibility of the president to interfere with justice.
Trump's fired for the Secretary of Justice, it was that Mueller would hardly be able to act independently, has raised a lot of Washington rumors for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing his earrings to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of killing the president through the 25th judge.
Rosenstein refused the report.
But Monday ago, he went to the White House in the rumors that he was about to resign.
Instead, his meeting with President Trump -- he was visiting the United Nations Council in New York -- scheduled on Thursday.
President Trump said, he "do not want" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid conflicts with the hearing of the Senate judicial committee between Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse had been testified.
On Friday, President Trump asked the FBI to take a week to investigate the accusations against Kavanaugh, and continued to postpone the full vote of the Senate.
President Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she said, "The day is unspecified, maybe this week, may see the reason for the delay is because the other problems are happening at the Supreme Court.
But we'll soon get the news and the press will be updated."
Some reporters may not agree with that statement: Sanders haven't held a press conference at the White House since September 10th.
Chris Wallace's director asked you about this.
Sanders said that missing the press conferences is not because they don't like television reporters, though she said, "I'm also agreed that the real reporters are a lot of things."
Then she suggested that the direct relationship between President Trump and the press.
"The President is now performing more questions than any other president before," she adds without giving evidence, "We've considered the number of press conferences."
Sanders said that there's still going to be a press conference, but "if the press have a chance to ask the president of the United States, that's much better than talking to me.
We've tried so much, and you've seen we've had a lot of work in the last few weeks, this will replace a press conference when you can talk directly to the President of the United States."
President Trump regularly answers the questions when he left the White House or at open sessions or in press conferences when the authorities visited.
The press conferences are usually very rare.
This week, in New York, the president would have declared the reason, but he suddenly appeared in a strange form in front of the reporters.
The medical minister wrote to the European Federation staff who worked in Scotland's medical industry to talk about the fear of Brexit.
The medical minister wrote to the European Federation staff who worked in Scotland’s medical industry to express their gratitude and wish that the staff stayed back Brexit.
The medical minister Jeane Freeman sent a letter with the message that would resign in six months just after the United Kingdom exited the European Union.
The Scotland government commits to support the costs of claiming the residential state of the European Alliance citizens who are working in public service has been transferred.
In his letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "In this summer, the negotiations between the British and the European Alliance about the draft of the European Alliance continues, the decision will be made in this summer.
But the British government is also promoting the work prepared for the script that may not be able to make a deal.
I know this is a time of unstableness to all of you.
That's why I want to remind you that I now appreciate the contributions of each employee, whatever their nationality is.
Additionally, colleagues from the European Union have brought valuable experiences and skills to strengthen and improve medical services, and have benefited our patients and communitys.
Scotland is perfectly your home and we'd like you to stay."
Christion Abercrombie had to experience an emergency surgery after head trauma.
The Resistance of the Tigers in Tennessee, Christion Abercrombie, had been through an emergency surgery after the first injury in the war of 31-27 before Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Mike Organ in Tennessee sent news.
Coach of Tennessee, Rod Reed, told reporters that trauma took place right before the first break.
"He ran towards the border and collapsed," said Reed.
Coachs and medical staff have given Abercrombie to breathe the oxide right along the border before he put him on the stage and took him to check more.
An official from Tennessee told Chris Harris at the WSMV Champion in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was surgered at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris adds "no detailed information about the level of/injury" and Tennessee is trying to find the time of the injury.
Abercrombie, the second year student of the red shirt, first to fight underneath Tennessee's shirt after moving back from Illinois.
You have a total five fights on Saturday before you get out of the game and you have the total 18 games in this season.
The foreigners buy real estate in Britain will be more taxed.
The foreigners buy real estate in Britain will have higher tax counts. This increase will be used to help homeless people follow the new policy of Tory.
This change will fail in success in the effort to attract young Corbyn voters.
Taxing will apply to those who don't pay taxes in England.
It's a financial plan for this policy to increase up to 120 million pounds a year -- to help homeless people.
The foreigners buy real estate in Britain will be more taxed -- this extra money will be used to help homeless people, General Theresa May will announce today.
This change will unauthorized the success of trying to attract Jeremy Corbyn's young voters with the commitment to provide a cheap and aim to a high-income target.
The increase of taxes will apply to individuals and non-taxing entrepreneurs in Britain, which will motivate the government’s efforts to resist the current state.
Payment -- out of present tax levels, including higher taxes that have been published two years ago for the second house and the buying houses just so-- that could be up to three percent.
The finances expect this change will increase to 120 million pounds a year.
The estimate of 13 percent newly built real estate in London has been sold to non-English citizens, which raises the price of the house and makes the buyer ever more difficult.
Many of the wealthy areas of the country -- especially in the capital -- became a ghost town because most foreigners bought homes spend most of their time in another country.
The policy was new only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for tax cutting so that many youths could have the opportunity to own the first house.
He accused large building companies to hold the price of real estate by taking the land but not using it, he called General May to give up limitations for the priceless houses, not to overcome the "house accident" in England.
Mr. Corbyn also published a series of home reforms in order to attract voters, including control of renting and ending the deportation of "no fault".
He also wanted to give more powerful councils to build new houses.
Mrs. May said, "I told you last year that I would spend my time regain the dream of English -- that life would be better for new generations.
And that means that we have to redeem the markets in a very chaos.
Britain will always open the door for people who want to live, work, and build life here.
However, this does not mean that people who do not live in England and companies with foreign offices can easily buy homes as hard - working British inhabitants.
For a lot of people, dreams of having a house that has become too far and the retaliation is still very big."
Jack Ross: 'My last hope is to lead the Scotland recruits.'
The boss of Sunderland, Jack Ross, said his last hope was to be the manager of the Scotland team at some point.
Scot, 42-year-old, is facing the challenge of regaining the Northeast Club, now holding the third position at League One, three points less than the first.
He moved to the light stadium this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Excellent of Scotland.
"I want to fight for my country as a player...
I had a hat with B logo and that's what I wanted, "Ross told Sportsound of the BBC Scotland.
"My childhood year is attached to those battles of Scotland took place in Hampden with my father, and that's always what reminds me of.
However, that chance will come if I succeed in manageing a club."
Sunderland's predecessors before Ross include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former trainer Alloa Athletic said he didn't feel pressure when he was the successor after the great-year-old names at such a big club before he refused the offer from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"To me at this point will be evaluated by 'can I get the club back to the Premier League?'
The organisation and material facility at this club certainly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"This isn't a task to achieve easily, but I only consider myself successful if I can get the club back to the tournament."
Ross had been three years on the managership, after a while in Dumbarton and 15 months of training at Hearts.
Then he helped Aloa restore his position after falling to the third class, and brought St Mirren from the risk of falling into the next season champion.
Ross said he was now very comfortable during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It's probably a real turning," he recalls in the role leading alloa.
"I really believe I'm completely fit in the role of manager rather than a player.
This sounds strange because I was quite successful, had good income and achieved certain achievements as a player.
But the game isn't usually easy.
There's a lot of things you're facing for weeks.
I still have to endure the stress and pressure of my work, but I feel satisfied with management.
I've always wanted to do a management job, and now that I'm doing it, I feel most comfortable being myself during my adult life."
You can hear the full interview on Sportsound on Sunday, September 30, on Scotland Radio from 12:00 to 13:00 BST.
The survey shows that the ideal time to enjoy a beer is 5,30 pounds Saturday.
The hot summer sun has increased the sales for the bars that are in trouble in Britain but has more pressure on the restaurant chains.
According to the data, bars and bars have seen the income increased 2,7% in July -- but the income in the restaurants has dropped 4,8%.
Peter Martin, of the CGA business consultant, compounded the data, said, "The last time and the British team in the circle at the World Cup makes the trend of sales of July like July when the bars increase 2,8%, the restaurants are more severely affected.
The income at the restaurant was decreased 1,8% in June and worse in July.
The bars and drink bars have the fastest growth in comparison to the decline at restaurants.
Food bars are also affected by the hot sun, though not as serious as restaurants.
Looks like everybody just wants to drink.
The sales of drinks at bars and administrated bars have increased 6,6% in the month while the food sales dropped 3%."
Paul Newman, analyzing the entertainment and the RSM Hotel, says: "The results show the trends we've seen since the end of April.
The weather and effects of social events or big sports still are the biggest factors when talking about income at restaurants.
It's not surprising that the restaurants continue to be in trouble, the income drops 4,8% compared to the same year ago while the cost pressure continues.
"The last hot summer took place at the worst time for food suppliers, not knowing in August when the cooler weather could improve the present situation."
The total growth of income at bars and restaurants, including new open locations, was 2,7% in July, reflecting the reinstatement of marketing.
Coffer Peach Tracker's sales surveillance for bars, bars, and restaurants in England have collected and analyzed data of working efficiency from 47 teams, with more than 9 billion pounds, and that's the standard point of the industry.

Thank you for your appealing messages!"
An advertisement of milkworms comparing mothers with an online divided milk cow
A milk immersion company has divided opinions on the Internet with an advertisement that compares mothers to sucked cattle.
To mark the outlook of the product that is considered "make milk sugar can wear and can't cause the first noise in the world," the consumer company, using Elvie, launched a promotion inspiring music video to show the freedom that the new sucking machine brought to the mothers.
Four mothers jumped in a dry grass in a song: "Yes, yes, I milk myself, but you didn't see any tails and, "In case you don't realize, this is not my breasts, they are my breasts."
The chocolate continues: "Buck out the milk, suck out the milk, I'm feeding the kids, sucking out the milk, I'm milking for my girls."
However, this advertisement, published on the Facebook page of the company, has caused many online arguments.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, this video has received many deferred reactions from the audience, many opinions that this advertisement is lightly considered the milk industry's horror.
"A bad decision to use cattle to advertise this product.
Like us, they must be pregnant and beared to produce milk, except the cattle were taken from the mother in a few days after birth," said a writer.

Another person said, "This can cause psychological damage to both mom and baby.
Yes, why don't you use to advertise milk sucking machines to the mothers who are feeding you?"
Another comments: "This advertisement has nothing to do with."
There are also advertisements, a woman who admits that she finds the song "That's funny."
"I think this is a unique idea.
I'll get myself one if I still suck.
It really makes me feel like a cow.
This advertisement is kind of crazy but I understand its message.
It's a unique product," said another man.
Another comments: "This is a interesting advertisement for mothers who need milk (in the workplace or in the toilet) and they feel like cows.
This isn't an advertising or assessing the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a woman group revealed that they had danced with milk immotioners hidden in the underwear.
The idea behind this campaign is based on the fact that many women suck milk so that they say they feel like cattle.
However, the Elvie milkmaker does not cause noise, no wire or pipe, and she is carefully inside her breasts, helping women to freely move, hold the baby, and even go out while smoking milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, commented: "The smoker of Elvie's milk is actually a revolutionary product, worthy of a bold recommendation and promotes curiosity.
In comparison with women with milk, we want people to know the milk product and the related challenges, and to show a merry and empathy about the freedom that newly absorbed milk product brings to the mothers.
This isn't the first time the Elvie milkworm pops up on the titles.
During the London fashion week, a mother and mother appeared on the catwalk floor of the designer Marta Jakubowski while using this product.
Hundreds of immigrants traveled quietly to a tent camp at the Texas border.
The number of imprisoned immigrants have increased mutual changes, although the number of monthly passengers is still almost unchanged, partly because the Trump government’s uncomfortable arguments and policies have made it harder to bring children to the donors.
Traditionally, most of the contributors once were without papers, and they were afraid that receiving a immigrant child could affect their own ability to stay in the United States.
The risk increased in June when federal governments announced that potential donors and other adult members of the family would have to take fingerprints, and this data would be shared with the migration agency.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high official of the Diplomation and the Navy Department, witnessed before the Congress that this agency had arrested dozens of young children who had no supervisor.
This agency then confirmed that 70 percent of those who were arrested had never had a criminal record.
"Most 80 percent of the donors or members of the donor's family are here illegal, and most of them have a criminal record.
So we're on trial these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
According to the employees working at refuge camps, so that they can quickly handle the case involving these children, the officials have made a new rule that demands a number of sponsors to appear in court within a month in prison, instead of after 60 days, according to the preceding standard.
Many will appear through a video conference, instead of being directly present, in order to defend their legal status before a migration judge.
The judges who were judged were not qualified to be supported will be quickly deported.
The longer the children are held, the more they become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violence or attempts to escape, according to the employees at refugee camps, and according to the system reports in recent months.
The advocates said that the anxiety increased at a bigger facility like Tornillo, where they saw a child who had a lot of casuality to be ignored because of the scale of camps.
They add that bringing children to refugee camps without allowing them to have enough time to prepare for the mental or to say goodbye to their friends can cause psychological damage that many children are suffering.
Syria suggested that the U.S., France, and Turkey's power move out of the country immediately.
Before the United Nations Council, the Prime Minister Walid al-Moualem also called the Syrian refugees to return to the country, although the civil war had passed on to the eighth year.
Moualem, vice secretary, said that foreign forces were on illegal Syria, in the name of the anti-terrorist forces, so "will be handled."
"They have to get out of Syria in terms and immediately," he launched in front of the council.
Moualem emphasized that "the war of terror in Syria is near to the end," there are now over 360,000 people who have died since 2011 with millions of people to leave their home.
He said Damascus would continue to fight in this holy war until we were to clear the terrorist groups out of all Syrian territories, and "the illegal presence of foreign forces."
Now the U.S. have about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who are trained and counseled for all Kurds and Arabic forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 foot soldiers in the country being destroyed by war.
About refugees, Moualem said that the country's condition was good enough for them to go back, and he blamed "some Western countries" that had "sounded the fear of irrational" that made the refugees not return.
"We've called international community and humanitarian organizations that made conditions for refugees to return," he said.
"They're using political cards for humanitarian problems."
The U.S. and the European Union warned that there will be no reconstruction for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opponents to end the war.
The United States diplomatics pointed out the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey about setting a neutral area in the last rebel zone of Idlib has made the opportunity to move political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a massive attack from the Syrian forces backed up in this province, where three million people are living.
Yet, Moualem emphasized this deal with "specific time" and expressed hope that military action would be aimed to the holy elements that include soldiers from the Nusra Front linked with Al-Qaeda, the objects "will be wiped out."
The United Nations Staffan de Mistura agent hopes to gather soon the first meeting of the new committee, including the government and the controversial members, to prepare the constitution after the war for Syria and open the way for the election.
Moualem sets the conditions for the Syrian government's participation into this committee, he says that the committee's work is limited to "seeing the terms of the present constitution" and warns not to interfere with the elections.
Why is Trump gonna win in the second period?
Logically, President Trump will win in the vote in 2020 unless the process of accusing and confusing causes to end the pre-time presidentship, as the liberalists are hoping.

Of course, unlike what's going on on TV, any Washington movement can decide Roe v. Wade's future, or the reunion problem of immigrant families and global economic situation.
Only a few television audiences have the right to choose their channel.
Not just that, it's more attractive than the news, when you get six hours to see a group of experts debate about using Bob Woodward's "speople" information in the book "Fear," or the bomber fur coat for the $15,000 dollars of Paul Manafort, "a bold dress," the Washington Post writes, and the hiddens of the overdrinking words of Stormy Daniels of the President Trump.

It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th sector was witnessing a cash raining, due to the reconstruction of the council area that made two responsible men run into the same chair.
The recent reorganization at Pittsburg County has banned the Conor Lamb Democratic Party - who has earned a seat at another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb's running with the Republican candidate, Keith Rothfus, who is now representing the 12th district in Pennsylvania, has a lot of territories with the new 17th District.
The main area map was rearranged after the High Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were arranged to cheat in a way that benefited the Republicans.
The new 17th District race has become a financial race between the major funding organizations of the party, the Democratic Committee of Congress Operation (DCC) and the Republican Committee of NRCC.
Lamb was a familiar name in Pennsylvania after victory in a special election watched in March for the 18th Congress of Pennsylvania.
This position belonged to the Republicans for over a decade and President Donald Trump won 20 points in this district.
Political commenters have considered the democracy higher.
The United States overlook El Salvador's punishment for China, but then retreated.
The diplomatics found that Dominica and Panama recognized Beijing, Washington, almost no objection.
President Trump had a contract meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and the President owned a hotel in Panama until the Smurf Organization's discharge partners fired.
The officials of the Ministry have decided to summon the U.S. diplomatic crews from El Salvador, Dominica, and Panama by "the recent decisions of disrecognizing Taiwan," Heather Nauert, according to the statement of the speaker of the foreign department at the beginning of the month.
But the penalty just weighed for El Salvador, which took the price of 140 million dollars in 2017, including control of drugs, development, and economic support.
The proposed punishments, including cutting the financial aid and restricting the visa for some objects, will cause great damage to this Central American country, which now has a high unemployment and crime rate.
When internal meetings were taking place, North-American and Central America officials delayed a high-end convention concentrating on security and economic matters to reorganize a similar meeting last year was considered an advancement of effort to prevent immigrants from going to the United States.
But in the middle of September, high officials claimed that they wanted to continue the convention, which helped to eliminate the oversight of the penalty for El Salvador of the United States.
The diplomatics say, Vice President Mike Pence is currently intended to speak at the convention, planned in the middle of October when there's a signal to perform major action.
And three American agents back quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and Dominica Republic without any hard messages or punishment from Washington.
A White House speaker refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomatics, who agreed to discuss internal discussions with anonymous condition.
Their information has been confirmed by a external analyst who has a close relationship with the government and also anonymous speech.
History of Research
The next bomb could be a report of Robert Mueller's special adviser on the distorted behavior of President Trump, where there's a lot of evidence in public records.
People think Mr. Mueller's transferring his investigation to the issue between President Trump and Russia during the presidential election.
If there's a change in the Congress, President Trump will have a lot of problems in the Congress, right before the preparation of the campaign to vote, and even with the members of the same party.
There's a lot of problems, I don't mean to mention the departure of the President Trump that is unreasonable -- just like your colleagues in Europe.
All sides of the Atlantic need to make choices and this will affect the long-term time of this fight.
In 1938, German officers were willing to take up a major island against Hitler, if the West agreed to fight against and support Czech in München.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to escape the years of slaughter.
History turns around such traits, and democratic unrepentant struggles will increase or delay.
The Americans face some of these.
What if the president Trump fired the prime minister Rod Rosenstein, who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's been sitting in the fire since the last year's report about you proposing secret recording the president and speculating the president's inappropriate.
Mr. Rosenstein instituted information from the Times newspaper was inaccurate.
"How do we react if the new F.B.I. investigation on Brett Kavanaugh is not enough or unfair -- or if you confirm the Supreme Court even though there are reliable accusations of sexual assaults and unrealistic statements?
More than that, we'll vote in the middle of the age for a Congress so that this agency will force Mr. Trump to be responsible?
If we fail in these challenges, the democracy will lose power for a long time.
But I believe we won't fail, because I had a lesson in Prague.

Graham Dorrans' optimism of the Ranger team before the Rapid Vienna encounter.
Rangers fight Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that winning before the Austrians, after the impressive peace in Spain before Villareal in the beginning of this month, will give them the advantage of gaining access to the G board of the Europa League.
The knees injured that prevented Graham Dorrans from getting the first time in the season until the 2-2 with Villareal, but he believed that Rangers could use that result as a pedal for more wonderful things.
"It's a good thing for us because Villarreal is a strong team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We've been in the fight with the belief we're going to get one point.
We were supposed to win at the end of the game, but the ratio is also not a bad result.
They may have played better in the first round, but we've rebelled in the second round and got better manners.
Next Thursday, it's going to be a big game in Europe.
Hope that we can win three points but it's going to be a hard fight because they've got good results in the previous game, but with the strife of fans, I'm sure we can get through and get the good results.
Last year was a difficult time, I was injured and the changes in the club, but now I have a very good feeling.
Good team, players are well-fashioned and well-trained.
Hopefully we can keep moving deeper to reap a successful new season."
Women are so worried that they're sleeping because of the retirement problem.
Despite the fact that participants are well aware of what they care about, few people exchanged with family members.
Some half of the people who attended the Nationlarge report that they had talked to their wives or husbands about the expense of long - term care
Only 10 percent indicate that they have talked to their children about it.
"Everybody wants a family member to take care of them, but they don't trade on this," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Nationbroad's life insurance insurance business.
These are the steps to start.
Talk to your wife/children and children: You cannot prepare your family for your care if you do not show your desire first.
Converse with your counselors and family to discuss where and how to be cared, for those choices can be an important factor to determine the cost.
Bring your financial counselors: Your counselors can also help you provide a way to pay for those expenses.
Your financial choices for long-term care purposes may include traditional long-term care insurance policy, the cash-depense policy to help cover these expenses or buy insurance on your own - as long as you have money.
Prepare thoroughly legal documents: Avoid possible legal wars.
There is a plan for health care so that you can assign a reliable individual to monitor the health care process and make sure that experts follow your wishes in case you can't communicate.
Also, consider the proxy of your account.
You should choose a trustworthy person to make financial decisions for you and make sure you pay your bills if you are not capable.
Do not forget small details: Imagine that your parents are in medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and allergies?
List those details so that you can always be ready.

Federal prosecutors are offering death sentences for NYC terrorist attacks.
Federal prosecutors in New York are offering death sentences to Sayfullo Saipov, suspects in the terrorist attack in New York have killed eight people -- a rare punishment not yet carried out in this state for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, was supposed to have used a rented truck from Home Depot to perform a attack on the West Side Highway in the Lower Manhattan, crashed on footman and bicycle driver on October 10th.
In order to justify the death sentence, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intent" kills eight victims and causes serious body damage, according to the announcement of proposing for death sentences, delivered at South New York City.
Both of these crimes can be sentenced to death, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the assault, a federal jury accused Saipov with the 22 charges of crimes that had eight deliberately murders, often used by federal prosecutors in organized crimes and charges against violence and destroying the car.
The attack requires a "planning and accuracy," the prosecutors say, when describes the way Saipov does "sudden, cruel, and inhuman."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has wounded, damaged and lost Diego Enrique Angelini's family and friends, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian" on the court notice.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern New York district executed death.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was condemned to kill two drug suppliers but finally sentenced to life in September 2009.
The last time the death sentence was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after they were accused of conspiracy to spy out the Soviets in Cold War two years ago.
Rosenberg’s husband and wife were executed by the electronic seat on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbekistanian, had no regrets after the attack, according to the court document.
He declares to the investigators that he feels good about what he does, the police say.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to do the attack after watching the ISIS video on the phone, according to the charge.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, the police told him.
He didn't confess to the 22 charges of crime.
David Patton, one of the federal defense attorneys representing Saipov, said they were "powerless" with the decision of the prosecutor.
"We think that the decision to make a death sentence instead of accepting a confession to a life sentence without the ability to release will only extend the damage of this event to those involved," said Patton.
Saipov's lawyers had before asked the prosecutors not to give a death sentence.
Conservative Conservative Conservation Conservations claim that NIGEL FARAGE is responsible for negotiating Brexit
Nigel Farage claimed to be "attached people" in a protest at the conservative conference.
The former Ukip leader said that the politicians had to get the heat of the European skepticists -- because one of the congressmans of General Theresa May suggested that he should be responsible for negotiating with the European Alliance.
Conservative Peter Bone said in the Birmingham march that the Britain's out of the alliance right now if Mr. Farage is Minister Brexit.
But the challenge Prime Minister May faced when he tried to settle the deep divisions of conservative conservative conservatives, supporting staying in the European Union, joined a protest against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is cramping to keep the consoling plans between the attacks from Brexit supporters, the supporters staying and the European Union.
Allies claim that she will move by trying to make a deal with Brussels despite the intense reaction - and force the European skepticism and the labor party to choose between their plans and "the state of this chaos."
Mr. Bone said in the leave Medicines Leave at Solihull that he wanted to're against the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Mr. Farage stay in the Senate and be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he's the responsible man, now we're probably out of the alliance," he said.
Congressman Wellingborough adds: "I'll support Brexit, but we need to fight the Chequers plan."
He assured his objection to the European Union: 'We don't fight in world wars to be submissive to others.
We want to build our own laws."
Mr. Bone rejected the proposal that the opinion has changed since the vote in 2016: 'The idea that the British have changed their minds and wanted to remain in alliance is completely wrong.'
Brexit supporter of the Conservative Party, Andrea Jenkyns is also present at the protest, saying to the reporters: "I just want to say, "President, listen to the people.
'Ain't a lot of people who approve of the Chequers plan, the opponent will not vote to this plan, which usually doesn't happen to our party, our operator, who will be willing to call the people's support and vote for us from the beginning.
Give up the Chequers plan and listen to the people."
In a message to Mrs. May, she added: "The prime ministers kept their chair when they kept their promise to the people."
Mr. Farage says that politicians have to participate in protests to "recognize the heat" if they change the decision that was made in the 2016 public proposal.
"This is the problem of our faith -- the people -- and the political class," he said.

The Grand Prix Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton won the world champion after winning Sebastian Vettel.
Valtteri Bottas was obviously better than Lewis Hamilton on Saturday when Mercedes were still a strong team at the season.
From the start point, Bottas had a good start and continued crossing Hamilton to protect his position in the first two rounds and made Vettel have to fight with his colleague.
Vettel went to the pit first and abandoned Hamilton when he got back in the race, a decisive action.
The Mercedes went to the pit after Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead by the racing on the Ferrari had to slow down to avoid the risk after two blocks to protect the third position.

He finally entered the pit at the 44th race, but he couldn't speed the other eight rounds when Raikkonen got the fourth position.
It's a gay race because Valtteri competed very well at the end of the weekend and that's a really good racer.
Finally, the team had a great race to win the number one and two, "Hamilton spoke.
It's a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at the Saturday campaign because she insisted that she didn't leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford on the charge of the highest court in the Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted.
The President was not directly targeted by Ford before the Senate of the Justice Committee, instead commented that what was happening at the Senate shows that people were "false and unfair."
"There's been something going on and what's going on in the Senate for the last day, you can feel anger, you can see people angry, bad and unresponsive," the President shares.
"When they looked at articles and read the flowing news, they said, "Oh, I'm not the one who did it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak the news?
Remember her answer... you leak the document right - "God, what's going on?
No, no.
I don't leak."
Come on, wait a minute.
We leaked... no, we didn't do it," said the president to the senator's words.
Feinstein was sent ford in detail about the charges against Kavanaugh in July and the information was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denyed that her office leaked information.
"I didn't hide the charges of Dr. Ford, I didn't leak her story," said Feinstein to the committee, the Hill message.
"She asked me to keep my secret and I kept the secret as she asked."
But the president seemed unpleasant about her denial behavior and he commented in the Saturday Motion: "I'm going to tell you about that, that's actually a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing the candidate of the Supreme Court, whose three women accused him of sexual abuse, the president claims that the Democrats are using charges for their own purposes.
"They're determined to regain power in any way.
You'll see the meaning and annoyment because they don't care who hurts, they want power and control," Mediaite leads the president.

Analyzing tells us the time at the night that the girl was burned alive.
The base base was on Saturday records during the recruit of a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst of the American Justice Department Paul Rowlett has witnessed in court for hours as an intelligence analyst.
He proved to the jury how to use a cell phone record to synthesize the process of the charged Quinton Tellis, 21-year-old and the victim Jessica Chambers, the 19-year-old of the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from a cell phone number that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she was dead, contradicting his previous statement, Clarion Ledger delivers the news.
The data shows that his cell phone was in the same location with Chambers' phone during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police interrogated Sanford.
Sanford testified in court on Saturday and confirmed that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if she was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "dealing because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradictory detail is Tellis said that he knew Chambers about two weeks before she died.
The cell phone record shows that they only know each other for about a week.
Rowlett said that occasionally after Chambers' death, Tellis erased Chambers' messages, calls, and communication information from his phone.
"He erased you from his life," said Hale.
The lawyer planned to start secret debates on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury's trial that day.

Another black guy?!
My brother NY sued a couple who fired her after a rash message.
A nurse in New York Nanny sued a couple who fired her because she was disrespectful after she missed a message from a mom complaining that she was "a black man."
A couple refuse to be racists, considering the case to be a "repent" case.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a two-children mother, was depressed when he found out that the new nurse, Giselle Maurice, was the black man on the first day she came to get a job in 2016.
"NOT, IT WON'T WON'T WITH A FLAxman," said Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to his husband like that.
However, instead of sending a message to her husband, she sent to Maurice twice.
After recognizing the mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman "patient" fired Maurice, she said that the African nurse was about to quit doing a bad job and that she was hoping that she had a Filipino breast, according to New York Post.
Maurice was paid every day and went home to Uber himself.
Now, Maurice is starting to sue a couple to compensate for the fire act of 350 dollars a day in six months for the work that she was hired to receive money, although they didn't sign any contracts.
"I want to show them, look, she shouldn't do things like that," she said to the Post on Friday, she added, "I know it's the difference."
The couple protested the accusations that they were racists, saying that ending Maurice's work was reasonable because they were afraid they couldn't trust her after they insulted her.
"My wife sent her a message she didn't want to send.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," said Joel Plasco husband to the Post.
"But can you give your son to someone you insulted, even by mistake?
What about the newborn baby?
Say it."
When comparing the case with a "repent" case, Plasco said that his wife had been born two months and was in a very difficult situation.
"How will you deal with a man like that?
This isn't one thing to do," said the banker.
While it's on the legal case, the draft of the public opinion has rapidly pointed to the couple on social media, cheating their behavior, and the logic of the story.
Paddington publisher fears that the reader won't care about the story of a speaker bear, the letter says
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, was born right after the book was widely accepted, the letter revealed: "It's hard to put yourself in the position of others when reading the book for the first time being published.
It's great that we know about Paddington's great success."
When he talked about his father, a filmer for the BBC station before he was inspired to write a book for children from a small toy bear, he still felt optimistic when his work was rejected, she shared in the 60 - year - old anniversary of publishing the book, which was a "happy and confusion" after his death last year.
When she talked about Paddington, she described it as "a very important member of our family," she added that her father was always proud of her success.
"He's a pretty depressed man, and he's not a powerful man," she said.
"But because Paddington really exists with him, it's almost like you have a child and it's reaping certain successes: you're proud of them even if they don't exist.
I think you've taken Paddington's operation that way.
Although it's the product of his creativity and imagination, he always won a certain position for Paddington."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye through the phone.
As soon as she landed her daughter, she was hurried to Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors tried to save her alive but nothing.
"I call Nad regularly to say that this is bad and she doesn't have to suffer like that," said Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying she'll stop breathing in two minutes and I have to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, sweetheart.
I'll see you soon.
I'll always be with you.
The doctors have pumped a cardiac medication and slowly pulled the pipe out of her body.
She stopped breathing several times and this is the last time.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this hasn't been closed.
I can't scream or yell or cry because I'm with my family and people.
I have to be the one who links them."
Finally, Ms. Ednan-Laperouse, who is still grieving because of her daughter's departure, has been on a plane with other passengers -- face the challenge she'll have to go through.
"No one knows," she said.
"I bowed my head and wept all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I felt pity for Nad.
He needs my love and understanding.
I know how much he loves her."
The sad woman posted postcards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women have lost self - suicide relatives trying to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on the Welsh bridge with inspiration messages and phone numbers that you can call for support.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 years old, had been through depression and committed suicide at age 18.
"I don't want any parent to be in the feeling that I'm going through every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old, lived in Lydney, says that her son was a promised cook with a brilliant laughter.
"All know about it because of that laughter.
They used to say the boy's laughing lights all the rooms."
However, he quit his job before he committed suicide because he saw he was "in a real dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, 11 years old, left just like his brother after ending his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there's going to be a chain reaction."
Mrs. Davis designed cards, "to let people know that there are always people that you can meet, talk, or even make friends.
Don't live in silence - you need to talk."
Ms. Humphreys, who was a friend of Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, his partner 15 years ago, shortly after his mother's death.
"He doesn't talk about feeling bored or disappointed or anything like that," she said.
"In the days before Christmas, we noticed that he changed his attitude.
He was tired of school on Christmas -- when the children opened gifts and he didn't even keep an eye on them or anything around."
She said that his husband's death was a great loss for them, but they still have to try to overcome: "This has caused a big hole in our family.
It breaks our heart.
But we all keep living and fighting it."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is floating when the FBI starts investigating.
Mr. Flake said on Saturday, "I think, if we really can get something like what he asked-a limited time investigation, we could get a little bit," he added that he was afraid that the committee would be "attached" in the celebration of parties.
Why would Mr. Kavanaugh and the Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their hesitation is just a matter of time.
The middle elections spent five weeks, on November 6th -- if it was hopefully, the Republicans are now in a very bad condition, would be more weaker in trying to find the representative that they want to elevate in the highest position.
George W. Bush called the senators, running the hallway to support Kavanaugh, who used to be a White House assistant under President Bush, from then to get to his wife Ashley, who was a personal secretary of President Bush.
What happened after the FBI announced the reports?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 of the Democratic Party.
There's still not clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes of the Senate, which allows Mike Pence, who is now Vice President, to remove the deck buttons and confirm its position in the Supreme Court.
The number of Koreans escaped 's strongly' during Kim's time
The number of Korean escapes was strong since Kim Jong-un took over seven years ago, a legalist in Korea spoke.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the Korean Universal, said that last year there were 1,127 escapes -- compared to 2,706.
Mr. Park reports that the straining of the border control between North Korea and China and the large number of smugglers being arrested is the key factors of this change.
Ping Xian hasn't made public comments.
Most of the fugitives from North Korea finally received Korean nationality.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most escaped to China are the longest borders of North Korea, and they can easily cross the DMZ area that is strictly protected between two countries.
China viewed escapers as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often forced them to return to their homeland.
The relationship between North Korea and South Korea -- technically still in war -- has improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met at Ping Xiangyang to have negotiations focused on nuclearing issues.
These movements took place after the history meeting in June between the President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, both sides agreed to extended terms to advance to Korean sector nuclear.
But on Saturday, North Korean foreign minister, Ri Yong-Ho blamed the American punishments that caused a delay in the process.
"If there's no confidence in the United States, there's no confidence in our national security issues and in that case, there's no other way we're going to find our own armor," said Mr. Ri in a speech at the United Nations Council in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "sexuality," and said that he was not fit in position at the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi's denomination leader called the man who was recommended for position at the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh as "responsibility" and said that he was temporarily inappropriate to serve at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help, but I think that if a woman ever did that, they would call it "responsive," said Pelosi about his reaction to Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate of Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh insists on denying the charges that he had assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were a teenager.
In the opening statement, Kavanaugh exposed a lot of feelings, at times he was almost crying and scrutinized when talking about his family and five months of school at high school.
He also strongly condemned the democracy in front of the committee, calling charges against him as an act of "morely planned massacre" because Hillary Clinton lost in the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he wasn't suitable for position at the Supreme Court, because he was clearly acting against the Democratic Party.
"I think he was removing his own identity when he expressed his statements and manners when talking about the Clinton family and the democracy," she said.
Pelosi refused when she was asked if she tried to accuse Kavanaugh if you were confirmed, and if the democratic Party won the majority of the votes in the House.
"I'm going to say this-- if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI, he's not just about the position at the Supreme Court, but he's got to deal with the court," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is the judge at the Resistance Court at D.C.
Pelosi adds, as a democracy, you care about Kavanaugh's ability to make a decision against the Hospital Health Act or Roe v. Wade, because you're considered a conservative judge.
During the discussion, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he changed some of the decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This isn't a time for an excitement, participation in the court and hopefully we're going to say," said Pelosi.
Women need to know how to use.
This is really a serious criticism, one month over another, year after year, the bigger rage of anger, and she couldn't pass without weeping.
"We cry when we're angry," said Miss Steinem to me after 45 years.
"I don't think that's unusual, and you?"
She went on, "I was very much helped by a woman, she was a superior director, she said that she was weeping when she was angry but to make a reaction when she was angry and started to cry, she would tell the person she just said, "You might think I was sad because I was crying.
I'm angry."
And she kept crying.
And I think this is great."
You are allowed to cry for this behavior as part of the way out of anger because they are basically misunderstanding.
One of my deepest memories when I was working at the first company was that it was a place for men, I was weeping when a rage broke out, that was when I was being an older woman -- it was the cold manager who always made me feel afraid -- pulled me into the stairs.
She told me, "Don't let them see you cry," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and happy that they're with you."
Patricia Schroeder, later a democratic congressman in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an affair on a boat called Monkey Business and left the race, Mrs. Schroeder was deeply disappointed, assuming that there was no reason that she could not stand on her own presidential campaign.
30 years later she laughed and said to me, "It's not a wise decision."
"There were seven other candidates in the race, and they needed another candidate.
Somebody called this race "The Snow White and Seven Uncles."
Because you're late in the campaign, you've lost your funding campaign, so you swear that you're not going to go to a vote unless you're able to move 2 million dollars.
The war has failed.
She found out that some advocates gave her $250 dollars instead of 1,000 dollars to support the male candidate.
She wondered, "Will they think I'd get a discount?"
When she declared that she would not start a official campaign, she had overcome the emotions - expressing appreciation for the people who supported her, disappointed with the system that made funds and targets on the voters rather than the delegates, she was angry about being separated from her sex - that she was so angry that she was so angry.
"You can think that I've been nervous," recalls Miss Schroeder how the press reacted to him.
"You thought Kleenex was a sponsor of my company.
I remember thinking about what they would put on my gravestone?
"Do you cry?"
The U.S. Trade War could be a good signal for Beijing.
Experts say that the opening wings for the commercial war between the United States and China have been stopped, and the war will continue, the cripple between the nations may be a advantage to Beijing.
In the beginning of this year, Donald Trump, the President of the United States, gave the first warning by taxing China's main export lines, including sun battery, steel and aluminum.
The growth has increased in recent weeks with 200 billion dollar taxes (150 billion pounds) hitting half of China's markets to import the United States.
Beijing has retaliated by increased taxes from five to ten percent to 60 billion dollars of American goods.
China commits revenge corresponding to the action of the United States and the second largest economy in the world is unlikely to be shaken early.
Catching Washington to compromise means that Beijing has to offer requests, but publicly resigning to the United States is too embarrassing to Mr. Steel Chairman, the Chinese president.
However, experts say that if Beijing can produce the right flags, the long-term pressure of the trade war with the United States could be a positive signal for China by reducing the dependency of two economy.
"In fact, a political decision in Washington or in Beijing can start a economic relationship in one of the countries, and this is actually much more dangerous than what was previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, a research expert focused on Asia at the new US Security Center.

Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome the help of reconstructing the devastated country.
But he emphasized that the nation would not accept a conditional help or help from nations who financed the rebellion.

Update of the red tide phenomenon: the red tide decisiveness of Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Fish and Wild animals Association of Florida shows that the density of the red tide has decreased in most of the Tampa Bay zones.
According to FWC, the flowering phenomenon has been reported in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier - this reduces the density of red tide.
The red tide spread in about 130 miles across the north coast of Pinellas south of Lee Quarter.
Small pieces were also found within 10 miles off the Hillsborough Beach, but fewer locations than last week.
The red tide was also observed at Pasco Quarter.
The average density across the coast or off the Pinellas has been reported in the last week, the density from low to high off the coast of Hillsborough, the density from low to high in the Manatee, the density to the height of Sarasota County, the density between the Charlotte County, the lowness to the seapart or off the sea at the Count Lee, and the lower density at Collier County.
The respiratory phenomenon continues to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier particles.
The respiratory reaction hasn't been reported in the northwestern Florida last week.
