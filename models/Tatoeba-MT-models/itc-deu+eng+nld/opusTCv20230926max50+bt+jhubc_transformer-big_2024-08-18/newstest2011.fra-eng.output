What's going to happen? CSSD knows neither Voldemort nor pastry in Prague.
The new elected CSSD mayors of the capital will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier to understand each other at the municipal council level with their old and new colleagues of the SDG.
The daily Actualne.cz has "tested" the new members of the municipal council belonging to CSSD, whether they know the slang that was born in recent years in the city hall, when it was the partners of the current coalition who led in Prague.
The coded vocabulary that Prague's political cr<0xC3><0xA8>me set in motion during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It was with surprise that it was discovered that the new elected officials did not understand the known terms very well.
At least they say so.
"Who is Valdemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I am a fast in the politics of Prague," Lukas Kaucky, the culture-elect, said in a statement.
And with regard to the political veteran, the elected Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example, the meaning of "golf hole".
"That's the only expression you're proposing to me that I'm using."
Otherwise, I don't use slang.
From the vocabulary, which the daily newspaper Aktualne.cz published in June of this year before the pre-ectoral congress of the SDG, the editorial staff chose 6 examples, primarily those related to the Prague City Hall.
The socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", going to the pastry shop", "beef nerve", "betrayal of the capital" and "entoll".
Three of the elected officials agreed to the quiz, the fourth - Antonin Weinert, who is to lead education in Prague in the future - first promised an interview but then did not pick up the phone.
The fifth-elect Petr Dolinek flatly refused the test.
"I don't care at all about these things and how the representatives of citizen democracy have fun: I won't give my opinion."
"I am currently working on how we will understand each other as part of our programs," he said.
As we have already heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would apparently not recognize in the above legend, that it is the influential Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of the former mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" says nothing to Kaucky and the only expression he guessed in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," Kaucky said, adding immediately, "But I know from the newspapers."
“I’m going to have to pay for a language course,” he jokes.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the chosen for the environment, know that the golf hole is the Blanko tunnel.
The two Social Democrats know who Voldemort really is and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks in the sense of "going to the bakery".
"It is, I think, going into a company," Plachy is ready to guess that it is the headquarters of the Janousek companies.
In the same tone Brezina recalls that he draws his knowledge rather from newspapers and not from any vocabulary he would use.
According to the candidates for the tests there is no lexicon of slang in social democracy.
“I’ve been consulting with colleagues and it looks like we really don’t have anything like that.”
“We’re more like saying names, sometimes we’re using abbreviations and symbols,” says Peter Hlinsky, president of the Social Democratic Party, which members of the party call Hulda.
“I was called Briza at school but I don’t know if my colleagues call me that,” Brezina said of the nicknames.
The newspaper Actuel.cz has tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is Daddy for the members of the Party or the less friendly Little old man, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the elections by scams during the sponsorship of the party, is nicknamed "the little toy".
The nicknames are also the only ones that allow the Social Democrats to use within the party.
It is reported that Hulinsky does not like to hear Hulda very much, but the daily Akutel.cz has recorded another nickname for this Prague president.
"Doctor in battering law" seems to recall that Petr Hulinsky obtained his title of doctor in law JUDr.at the police academy of bratislava.
The government wants to reduce the torture of “witches”, a brochure has been published.
In Burkina Faso, women declared witches have common traits.
Rather, they are part of the old generation, cannot work for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one who becomes "witch" is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
“Man seldom has this destiny.”
“Young women are also not judged healthy because they participate in work and give birth to children,” says a sister who works in the West African capital, Burkina Faso, in a special facility of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He published a pamphlet that should help limit the witch hunt.
There's a "hic" in the case.
“More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read,” Die Standard newspaper warned of the inconvenience of written education.
The charge of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In neighbouring Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man and then burned with oil they had sprinkled on her.
This information was transmitted by the BBC server.
Criminals say it was the evil eye.
According to their version, the oil used for ritual anointing was inflamed at the contact of the woman.
The oil burned, it seems, when the team wanted to "throw out the evil spirit" of the woman.
Isolation of "witches" is approved by people at all levels of education.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: “Human mind eaters have always been a danger,” he says.
As Burkina Faso strives to reduce witch hunts, the Gambia no later than last year even saw the President himself participate.
"The Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, launched a broad witch hunt which, he said, would have participated in his death and would have striven by black magic to kill the President as well."
“Shamans from nearby Guinea, who came to the rescue, brought to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of policemen and the personal guard of the President, randomly selected men and women from Gambia’s villages,” Amnesty International said in a statement.
Inmates on the farm had to drink an herbal potion with hallucinogenic effects that also had other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners did not survive.
On international pressure, about a thousand people were released.
The tenant of Bakal: The stoves are heating, he signed a higher rent.
An imposing elderly man walked out the door of the RPG Byty customer center of the "coal baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
He was carrying under his arm a file with three new leases for three apartments: his own, that of his daughter and that of his son who is serving a sentence.
Deregulation has increased the rent for these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to pay from next year for a 2+1 apartment of second category 4100 crowns.
"And there's no hot water and the heating works on solid fuel," he said of his son's new contract, the man with the signature power.
“But I signed it anyway,” he said, moaning in anger and half-resigned.
The citizen association of apartments BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental conditions as "immoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, when a notice will be published explaining the method to follow to claim.
But the man reacts to this with a gesture of the hand.
"One says this, the other says something else" frowning.
The Ostrava region becomes the laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, this is what most apartments in the Czech Republic expect, whose rents do not correspond to the market price.
Aktualne.cz has therefore decided to personally visit the "laboratory".
The RPG waiting room in Havirovska Street is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already full on Tuesday at 9am.
Right next to the door stands a security company guard with a device to call customers.
A special button, "rent 2011", is lit on the touch screen.
A single press and a paper with a number comes out of the device.
You don't have time to read your number "157" as your number is already starting to light up on the big screen under the top of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second, it's your turn.
After a brief moment, an old couple arrives to inquire about the rent, but the new rents do not seem to concern people in the waiting room.
The majority of people have come to solve common problems like everywhere else - claim for repairs, insurance-related events and so on.
In the Ostrava region, people from more than 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio have been receiving letters with new leases in their mailbox since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers them rent increases of 15 to 38 percent.
The special rental counter has been open to the public since 18 November.
"it has been working for almost a week, so it's still on trial," the employee responds, after a moment of hesitation, behind the counter when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Deragulation and the former miner's apartments in Bakal are a very sensitive local topic.
The vice-president of the parliament and from the region of Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek of the Social Democrats reported this fairly strongly before the elections and it now fills the local newspapers.
“Twenty years after them, I want a new floor.”
"They didn't even change me a put...n board in the toilet, relieves in the introduction the man mentioned.
However, it is mostly, according to employees, retirees who come to be sure that they will receive a discount on the new rent price if they sign now as promised in a special offer.
This is a rebate of half the amount of the rent that the other tenants who will have signed their new contract before December 15 will receive.
But the "deregulation" window on Havirovaska Street is really not overwhelmed by questions.
“Of the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for rent,” the employee says at the counter.
And yet RPG puts up both on its website and in the windows individual interviews on rents when necessary.
If the two parties do not agree on the rent, an independent court will make the decision.
“It’s not about threats, it’s just about informing about the unique and legitimate way to act legally,” RPG said on its website.
“No one will go to court here,” thinks one of RPG Byty’s employees and the man in the street in front of the customer center gives her reason.
“I have 13,000 retirement crowns and I have 5,000 crowns left to eat, I don’t have enough to go to court,” he says.
The employee suddenly feels uneasy.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that no one sign and therefore people wait," she said.
Rent regulation ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
“Moreover, the current rents still do not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund,” recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, that it is precisely the negligence of the fund for housing that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in rent.
However in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest with rents in apartments 4 billion, in four years from 2011 to 2014 it should make 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling in front of the upholstered armchairs of the waiting room on Havirosvka Street, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
"The rent increase in 2011 is 15 percent and concerns no less than 31,200 apartments or more than 90 percent of RPG apartments."
"And it will always be at most 7.50 Czech crowns per m2 per month," the screen says.
The 38 percent increase concerns only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
“In these cases, it’s a really very low increase of 19.66 Czech crowns per m2,” adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but gradual increase over 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money from the rent increase (see graph) is returned to the apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the rent increase agreement have priority.
The kindergarten is also part of the offices included the architects.
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch. Design.
No one could have expected it to also house a mini kindergarten with everything you need - colorful walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch. design employees can go there.
Architectural project company Arch. Design., whose workshops have produced a large number of buildings in Brno, has designed its mini business kindergarten since the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
She employs about 90 people, mostly of child-bearing age, and she was concerned that women architects and project managers could quickly get back to work.
At the same time as reduced-time contracts, kindergarten is a bonus offered to its employees by Arch. Design. as part of its social program.
Builders and architects have the opportunity to combine work taking care of children.
It was the employees of Arch.Design themselves who conceived this kindergarten and with the support of management they were able to obtain an endowment from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini kindergarten is financed by the European Social Fund through the Human Resources Operational Programme and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
They were able to purchase equipment and appliances and after two years to provide qualified personnel as well as start-up.
After the use of the funding endowment (two years) the company Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to operate the mini kindergarten on its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and it was the company Economy rating that helped to make the application for staffing.
Children's care is provided by a qualified staff, all day a nurse and a kindergarten teacher take care of the children. children can go to kindergarten without age limitation but they are over three years for the most part.
As it is a "mini kindergarten" there can be only 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more who replace each other.
The operation of the school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use this school without regard to the hierarchical position.
Although it is an individual care and education, the curriculum of the mini-kindergarten is comparable to that for pre-school education.
The children do not only play, but quality education is also provided - from the beginning until the preparation at the school benches, English is taught.
The classroom is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can at any time control their child and not have the stress of a delay to pick up the children in a school far from the parents' workplace.
Parents use their time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that a natural relationship of loyalty is created between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design.s is thus registered among the companies that offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and that are friendly to the family and through this program strengthens HR marketing.
The bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Take a look at Gaudi’s interiors.
The roof resembles the back of a prehistoric saurian, the staircase has a dinosaur spine and the balconies have open fish mouths.
This is how the Casa Battlo house in Barcelona was built by the architect Antoni Gaudi.
Due to its organic shapes, the house has received from the locals the nickname of Maison en os.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaic, fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade reminiscent of scales and everywhere present curves, this is all that is epic for the Art Nouveau of Antoni Gaudi.
The front fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade of the house unfolds its dreamy lines, its pleasant colors and textures that recall nature and animals.
In the course of a more detailed observation we see the geometry, the rhythm and the order thought with precision.
In the night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of brightness of colors is reinforced.
The winding and twisting of the shapes also appears in the interiors with the same measure.
The wood copies in waves the window frames, the balustrades, the decorative elements of the doors, the eyelet and the slats.
The Battlo house that stands in the Eixample district in the shopping street Passeig de Gracia at number 43, was born from the construction of an 1877 house by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, first insisted on demolishing the old building and building a brand new one, but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a house with multiple dwellings was not conceived by Gaudi alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on his project that the decorations for a representative apartment of the owner of the building and the use of mosaic for the facade were born.
For the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade also worked other artists and creators.
The joint work for the Casa Battlo house plans began with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudi's Casa Mila and the Guell Park in which there are other works by Gaudi.
The locals dubbed the house hot right after it was finished because of its organic shapes "the House in Bone".
Others, in view of the specific mechanism of opening the windows have called it "the house that swings".
It is said that at the top of the construction there is a sword similar to that of St. George the patron of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of the construction contain hidden religious motifs.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system in its central heating time, with ventilation vents and typical fireplaces.
Their inclination of 45 degrees seems odd.
During the creation Gaudi absolutely did not respect the construction guidelines of the time and did not allow himself to be hindered by them.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained the building permit from the city, knowing, of course, that the data carried on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later during the finish the city council was horrified and asked for modifications.
For example, the members of the municipal council did not like that the pillars of the construction started on the public sidewalk.
There was never any change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the city's call Josep Battlo asked (and obtained satisfaction) permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and on the third a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewellery store.
The entire six-storey house is shared by a staircase through which one accesses to an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and replaced by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked on the modern concept of linking spaces.
The common part can be connected completely by opening the doors of the salons and the high society can communicate comfortably or otherwise limit the private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi has received in addition to new facades a non-traditional roof and two more floors.
Gaudi’s play with light is also impressive, with blue and white glazed tiles with which the inner courtyard is decorated and with skylights.
The two-color game gives maximum light in all floors of the house.
It was enough simply to bet on the principle that white reflects more than the dark which, on the contrary, absorbs the rays of the sun.
The Casa Battlo house that was inscribed in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund can be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and splendid apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous designer.
They continued the visits because they found it to be a lucrative business and expanded the field of visits to the common areas and attic including roof terraces.
The entrance ticket to the monument is really cheap and costs 16.50 euros; students, retirees, groups and tourist card holders have 20 percent discount.
The sum is still above the entrance price to Gaudi's other buildings in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic turrets, you must quickly find a comrade among the inhabitants of the building and completely visit the house.
How to choose a mattress and a bed base: women have other criteria than men.
No ostentatious frame, but rather the quality of the surface reserved for the bed, so the mattress and bed base give a real basis for a good bed.
They must of course complement each other harmoniously to please a specific user.
During the choice several things are decisive,: the weight, the size, the age, the state of health as well as the sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which the mattress and bed base will be placed is also important.
A typical example?
For example in the country house where you do not sleep continuously latex mattresses are not appropriate because they "warm up" gently.
They also have a higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they do not also have enough ventilation channels in the heart and if they remain, in addition, on a solid board, they retain moisture. Mold can also form there.
Habit is also decisive in choice.
Anyone who spends the day abroad, where very thick mattresses with a softening layer are frequently used, will hardly feel good on a low, hard surface.
“That’s how all the hockey players who come back from the NHL complain that they can’t sleep there.”
“For their tired shoulders, feet and ribs, they needed mattresses with a softening layer of lazy foam.”
"Such mattresses are also recommended for people who suffer from diabetes who have a nervous system disorder that therefore misunderstand the "information" of the joints and skin," explains Sylva Adamczikova who specializes in upholstered furniture.
This is why a few years ago the mattress with lazy foam conquered the hockey players as well as other customers.
"Today everything is going well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico have suitable mattresses for example.
You don't have to be an NHL guy to enjoy a lazy foam.
This “miracle” simply works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape according to the heat absorbed or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing puts pressure on you and you won’t turn around in the night like after a tough game.
You just sleep better.
The lazy foam also works as a protection against squaring.
For the choice of the mattress according to your size, add the length of the feet, i.e. about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman with a height of 180cm therefore need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each for a two-seater bed should be 90 cm or 180 cm in total.
For single beds, for example singles, it is recommended to take at least 120 /140 cm.
It is convenient in case of a visit.
'However there is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on the back you should lay your hands comfortably with the elbows slightly bent. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Mattress-Butterliers and Decorators who has been dedicated for several years to the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture and teaching in specialized schools.
For a two-seater bed each needs its own bed base and mattress, so be careful however during the checkout to choose the height of the mattress.
Otherwise you will only have to mount the bed base at different heights and this is not achievable on all bed frames.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, spring mattresses at least 15 cm, of this count for the layer of form and ventilation at least three centimeters.
"When touching or sitting on the mattress you should not feel the springs," warns Helena Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a well-determined type of mattress.
The bunk bed, when the mattress and the bunk bed are united like Siamese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses are very badly aired; it should not be washed, which is commonly done today.
And since during the night one normally sweats 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress begins to recall a large (and clogged) sieve.
For this reason, specialists refuse to advertise over a lifespan of 25 years for a mattress or a lifetime warranty.
But everything to his but.
And for this advice of experience from the sellers: for a mattress of 120/140cm, give up, for the covering of the mattress, hygiene or washing but rather add a protective mattress thatyou can easily remove and wash.
And even if nowadays it is common to manufacture coatings with zipper for the whole, that is to say that after opening we have two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine is very important!) otherwise the handling for large models (and for one person) becomes when they are removed a fight between a light weight and a heavy weight on a ring.
Do you have a rigid board in your bed instead of a bed base?
Never! Never!
Maximum for a bed intended for visitors for one night only.
However, equip the board (if there are none) with ventilation holes and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with pocket springs (from Germany Taschenfederken) and a layer of ventilation.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of a bed of this type.
For single-position slatted mattresses with 14/18 slats, latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (perhaps the combination of latex and coconut), are ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more slats, 28 and above, where the slats are doubled in the part of the bass and kidneys.
For mattresses with multiple positions, it is not necessary to take a spring mattress because it does not respond to changes in position.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the slats, a so-called shoulder cradle can also be installed.
This is a special connection of the slats that allows the slat to be pressed or even tilted so that the shoulder of the sleeper "fits in" well.
For men who have “shoulders as wide as their backs,” this is really an important thing.
This is already being considered by mattress manufacturers who for the "male" have begun to use a softening area at the level of the shoulders.
But they also think about women - they again offer them a softer surface at the hips.
For the most difficult customer there are wing or plate bed bases with what is called a multiforce suspension.
The pressure spreads to more points and dilutes the tension.
But of course, be careful, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and inflated with air) on good mattresses and bed base, the "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: the pillow should support the head and its tips should only reach the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that the Scandinavians prefer.
When lying on the side, the pillow should level (with the shoulder cradle of the bed base or the rammollie area in the mattress) the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first straw-based and herbal mattresses.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also to the organic mattress.
Petroleum-based raw materials, from which polyurethane is made, are replaced by natural oils, such as soybean oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use soybeans.
“The Bio label for mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products,” explains Petr vasicek from Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattress coatings; one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop scents of the forest or lavender.
There are differences between man and woman.
While birch plant extract for the mattress coating absorbs heat and cools the body, "cools" the man, the coatings "warms" women.
Red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore warmer for the weaker sex.
The current favorites?
Mattresses made from cold foam (it has more pores with a disturbed cellular structure therefore more breathable than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different stiffness of cold foams gives polyzone mattresses that know precisely where the head, lower back and feet are located.
You will pay for a quality mattress from 7,000 crowns and more.
Those who are characterized by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex took first place.
Saving for the mattress and bed base is not easy.
From time to time we may have as part of special actions from manufacturers or producers two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the company Magniflex offers Duofreeze mattresses with memory foam sewn to the coating for 11990 crowns.
Of course, you can take the second one for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and a large thickness was started with Tempur material at a "cosmic" rate.
This started as a matter for NASA because astronauts were undergoing enormous charge factors at the start.
Tempur softens in the heat and hardens, on the contrary, in the cold.
It therefore adapts perfectly to the warm human body and distributes optimal pressure to it.
It is therefore ideal against bad sleep and for an increase in comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special foot cushions that relieve the legs and the venous system.
Czech manufacturers use for example EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or the same type.
Devices to track people are increasingly in demand by parents who want to monitor their children.
Fear of their child leads more and more people to think about monitoring them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to search for cars can equally well be used to trace the movement of people and help in some cases such as that of the little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as big as a matchbox but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of little Anicka moved a large number of people and they began to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
“We strive to tell everyone that this is not espionage but just another way to lessen the likelihood of another tragedy,” says Petr Pilin of MAcro Weil, which is one of the providers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting it in the bag of a person who is not aware, but I have not yet encountered such cases."
“The majority of people are customers who actually buy the product for safety reasons,” Pilin adds.
According to him, children should always know what purpose "the box" is used for and how to use it in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bockova points out that if the child does not want to wear something like this, he will get rid of it.
“And even the little ones can show great creativity when it comes to purposely getting rid of something when they don’t want to be under control.”
“Mobile phones, which can be cut off like these tracking devices, have already led parents to long waits,” says Bockova.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in case of aggression is very questionable.
"If this is a prepared abduction, the perpetrator will do everything to ensure that the child does not have an electronic device that can locate him."
“Currently, it’s the phone.”
"As soon as the tracking devices are developed, they (criminals) will also be looking for them because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign."
“In such cases, criminals will always be ahead of the police,” she said.
She admits, however, that such devices can help in an unprepared assault by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of an assault.
"The device can be configured in such a way that it is in regular emission after a certain period of time."
“In the event that the device is destroyed, it still remains the last position of the person concerned.”
"The more expensive devices also have an inclinometer that immediately signals the position of the person who slipped and finds himself in the lying position without moving," Cech says.
According to him, so-called smart mobile phones that are equipped with a navigation system, can offer a comparable service after having formatted it with a special software.
The problem with current tracking systems is that it is either a device similar to those worn as a matchbox-sized pendant or smaller telephone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of the company Macro Weil, this is why tests are currently being carried out to make devices that look like common digital watches.
“This will have the advantage that the potential aggressor will not be able to recognize the tracking device.”
“Or he’ll figure it out after a while, which will give the police a little more time,” he added.
Whether the tracking device is developed in the form of a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as for tracking cars.
It is a combination of position acquisition systems by means of GPS (which is commonly used in auto-navigation) and a function of a mobile phone that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonating strings that it could go around the Czech Republic with it, but it can only last two years.
The army bought for 445 km of cords used for explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defence bought 224 km of it.
The army therefore has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of the strings is two to four years maximum.
The army bought detonating cords from the public limited company STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The reason given by the General Staff for the auction of a huge amount of detonating ropes to MF DNES is that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the reserve calculations made by the fireworks technicians of the army, which MF DNES contacted, it appears that even generals, officers with a command, secretaries or household staff should have an explosives exercise every year.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defence, and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army, are no exception.
Only to argue the army's annual consumption of 60 km of detonating cords.
This distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were true, the army reserves could sustain it for 10 years.
If on the contrary it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals it is enough to have more than 2 m of detonating ropes, as the experts say, it means that the army with its new purchase has ensured - with also the consumption of special units and engineering - reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
However, the soldiers of the rapid response brigade recently complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their handguns and that shooting sessions are limited due to the need for money.
About the lack of body linen, we don't talk about it.
“And I don’t mind if they buy so many detonating strings from us.”
“And it’s their decision and they really know what they’re doing.”
“For us the military is a good customer that we strive as merchants to be content,” says STV Group Commercial Director Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, argues that hundreds of kilometers of detonating cords are being purchased because the army will have these "ammunitions" in reserve for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group reports, however, that the lifespan of the firing cords and the fireworks technicians of the police and army is only two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in the depots, it can even go up to four years," says one of the two who does not want his name to be published in view of the criticism of the army.
The life span passed, each ammunition must be tested to see if it remains intact and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
These tests, however, are not free and still cost money.
The other argument of the ministry is a rebate due to the amount for 445 km of detonating cords.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's supply of 245 km," said spokesman Pejsek, who interprets the opinion of buyers from the Ministry of Defense.
Just to compare: the annual consumption of the firing cords of the fireworks technicians of the police that neutralize the ammunition of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 meters.
And the police always order only the amount of ammunition needed to be used before the end of their life.
This was established for the safety of pyrotechnicians and also to be able to obtain more flexible types of more modern and reliable detonating cords.
The Ministry of Defence today has big problems for the neutralization of tens of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand men was preparing to move, heading on the Rhine.
What awaits in a few years this Czech army that MF DNES has contacted: neutralizing hundreds of kilometers of detonating old ropes that it buys today "cheap".
To this day I take advantage of the contacts I have obtained through the contests.
The franchise sale of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun to win the Best Individual Entrepreneur competition.
The winner of last year’s Best Individual Entrepreneur competition was Lukas Pytloun, a 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His adventure to success is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun loved to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Liberec there was a lack of quality hosting site at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had earned while working abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 apartments half demolished.
Knowing that he was still a third-year graduate student, it was a courageous action.
“The ratio of quality to price of accommodation in our region made me want to do something,” says Lucas Pytloun.
He began renting the first rebuilt apartment to foreign workers.
He reinvested the profit in the building which he transformed into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, his entrepreneurial activity has allowed him to open in Liberec 4 guesthouses, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of almost 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, he had another one of the same quality.
“We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our franchise concept and other candidates for the Pytloun hotel franchise showed up.”
"And for the sale of the license for the commissioning of a large-scale hotel the victory in the Entrepreneur of the Year competition served well," adds Pytloun with appreciation.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known in Liberec and its surroundings.
“People recognized me on the streets, congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very nice,” he recalls.
He recommends participation in this competition to all those who strive to do something.
It is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says he is still using his contacts and knowledge that he could not have obtained in any other way.
"With those I met through the contest I started to maintain business relationships regularly.
According to him, the reputation related to success has also had an impact on employees.
And he's about 70.
“I observe in their homes above all the loyalty and pride of having engaged in something that has been generally recognized.”
"This is by far not the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of all of us together.
“Only my name is pushed forward,” says Lucas Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successor a better year than the one we had at Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the sense of purpose of the winner Farmet has the worst moments behind it.
The one who came to fetch the award from Slovansky dum for the first place in the contest for the Firm of the Year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the Farmet company.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which it transformed a tool shop in Ceska Skalice into a firm with a turnover of 100 million crowns.
“I can say that the award has not only encouraged me and my employees but also increased our self-confidence to fight the competition,” said the winner of last year’s competition.
At the beginning of the history of the Farmet company there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state offered to the father of Karel Zdrasky to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of property by the communists, he did not hesitate long, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with a few comrades in his father's entourage for the manufacture of plastic bathtubs.
Not long after they began to specialize in presses for vegetable oil.
After eighteen years it has become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company was known even in the non-specialized public after the success obtained in the contest through the media.
“Not only did our customers start to really get to know the Farmet brand better but also foreign partners who started to realize that they were collaborating with a company that had the greatest success in its home country,” says Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year has not happened at Farmet only in the euphoria of victory.
The company's assessment was based on the 2008 and part of 2009 economic results.
And in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machinery.
At the height of the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and begin to limit their purchases of new materials and technologies.
“Obviously we did not escape this situation.”
“Revenues fell by 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even lay off,” says Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that from time to time unpopular measures must be taken.
But they managed the situation correctly and retained beneficial results even if they were inferior to those they had before the crisis.
At Farmet, however, they continued to invest uncompromisingly in research and development.
"We have built a training and research center with the endowments, strengthened the company's presentation in international trade fairs and exhibitions and won the main awards in national exhibitions," says Zdarsky.
Everything suggests that the crisis is behind them.
The sales figures go back up and with them the number of employees also.
"To the new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere," says Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that removes senseless regulations.
The Absurdity of the Year investigation is for the fourth time a part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations could be removed.
The little-glorious winner of this year's Absurdity of the Year survey was the obligation to bring in the offices documents that officials can obtain online.
More than a third of the 4,000 voters voted for it.
For example, the social administration requested a paper extract from the trade register, whereas the grievor could obtain it with two clicks of the mouse.
It changes with the investigation.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer request the extract from the trade register for insurance payment checks," said Jana Buranova, a spokeswoman for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
To bring out all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs have to comply with in the Czech Republic and to remove those that are absurd is the meaning of this contest of the Absurdity of the Year.
This survey is again this year for the fourth time a part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even greater popularity.
If last year 3,000 voters came forward, it was at least 4,000 this year who brought their voices.
And this is not surprising, there are in our country the most diverse legal obligations that only slow down the company, and,this, more and more.
"We may be on the list of documents to fill out for tax returns in the top places in the world," says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of the activity of entrepreneur becomes a stated goal of all governments in recent years.
In comparison with the whole world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is in 74th place in terms of conditions for the company, 8 more places compared to last year.
The Absurdity of the Year contest was first set up in 2006 and continues each year under the same scenario.
Anyone can report the administrative and bureaucratic nonsense every year from April to the end of September, the last time before the end of the competition.
To report there is the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the contest organizer chooses seven candidates for "anti-price" and lets the public vote during the month of October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdity which received the greatest number of votes is declared victorious.
Until last year's survey, about a hundred, or more accurately 105 regulations and decrees have lost their meaning of existence.
The comments are sent by entrepreneurs but also by professional unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, so among the nominees is for example the requirement that maintenance vehicles of highways and expressways pay the tolls, or that contractors with twenty employees, repaint two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of the seven proposals is published on the contest website.
The proclamation of the competition, which always begins at the beginning of November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of an event in which personalities from political and public life regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kuzel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the culmination of the competition.
“Economic prosperity cannot work when the state puts spikes in the legs of entrepreneurs and for this my goal is to delete, every year, at least three dozen paragraphs that today only complicate the business,” said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to suppress absurd decrees is not a blow of the sword in the water.
In 2007, what people did not like was the obligation of entrepreneurs to declare three days before at the office for the individual company where the company is located, the intention to go to an exhibition or a pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was abolished with the amendment of the Individual Enterprise Act.
The second most popular requirement in 2007, which was to report to the Labour Office a 30-day service trip for a foreign employee, was removed with the so-called Green Card Act.
And everything is ok until the third session of the contest.
The Absurdity of the Year 2009 was the decree for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their office, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This was changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year—the requirement to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible firms.
Ecological, humanitarian, training and sports projects are evaluated.
The novelty of this year's Hospodarske Noviny competition, which has already existed for 5 years, is the category called Responsible Firm of the Year 2010.
The objective of this competition is reasonable and fair business support.
"We want to support companies that monitor their company's environmental impacts and conduct socially responsible activity," said Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone operator, Vodaphone, which is the guarantor and promoter of this contest, as in the case of the contest for the rebel of the year.
For this first year of this sub-category of the competition of the firm of the year 2010, organized by the firm Vodaphone, registered companies that do not have successes with a single long-term objective for the company.
The adventure of each of them is rich in inspiration and an independent article would be to be edited.
Although the purpose of their business is different from each other, their activity of support and forecasting can be considered as the denominator of their efforts.
In one case, this concerns persons with disabilities and the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for the whole Czech Republic is not the Prague pro-software company Et Netera which supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in a number of tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of a firm responsible for the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which for 17 years has been the main contributor to the endowment fund that sponsors children with disabilities.
In taking care of employees with health problems, we can also mention the old paper manufacturing plant in Podebrad, which employs more than 70 per cent and, for this, has obtained the title of the firm Responsible for the region of Central Bohemia and has placed third in the region in the competition of the Firm of the year organized by Vodaphone.
In Olomouc, MiRyz Soft, a financial company, won for having introduced flexible working hours and even reduced up to 35 hours per week on average and, this, without, proportionally, a reduction in wages.
The jury awarded it the title also because it buys primarily from Czech manufacturers, supports a small business in the surrounding area and is concerned about the environment.
“We strive to recycle as much as possible so that our business and our administration have the least impact on the environment,” says Miluse Ryznarova, the company’s executive director.
the responsible company IT Enlogit of the Region of Usti also thinks about the health of its employees and has put in place for each laptop an ergonomic chair and keyboard, encourages their work at home and uses the catering services of a local protected factory for its actions.
"We also support the Man in the Shadow Foundation that helps the local Roma community," said Ondrej Suchy, the company's representative.
In the last rank, also for its activities, there is a washing and cleaning company from the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the retirement insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above the standards.
"In our society we contribute to food, transport, increased qualifications and leisure," says Joseph Strapac of the construction company Bruntal Czasch, winner for the Moravian-Silesian region.
All regional finalists for the Vodaphone Firm of the Year competition, who had completed the questionnaire as an attachment to the registration document and returned it to the organizer by August 15, were automatically registered in the Responsible Company category.
Poorly completed or incomplete responses to the questionnaire were withdrawn from the competition by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the companies in the contest had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the responsible firm but were not disqualified from the "main" Vodaphone Firm of the Year competition."
"Independent registrations are not possible because it is a sub-category of the main Firm of the Year competition," explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
At the Land Fund in Plzen, police made arrests during a public contest
In the Land Fund building in Plzen, anti-corruption police have made arrests in recent days.
The detectives handcuffed the local contractor and real estate trader Lubos. G.
The latter had sought to precisely manipulate a public tender for the settlement of a restitution request in such a way that the proposed land would be obtained by a specific candidate.
The latter was to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"For the moment I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for insider trading as part of a public tender and competition," Plzen Prosecutor's Office chief Antonie Zelena told Pravo newspaper, knowing that it is forbidden to provide further explanations as the investigation is ongoing.
Police released the 46-year-old contractor after 24 hours.
To find out how he could influence a public competition, one can only speculate on the fact that there is so little official information.
On a question from Pravo, Lubomira Cerna Land Fund spokeswoman said that the police actually made an arrest in Plzen at a separate workplace during the public competition.
“He was a customer and in no way an employee,” she said.
The public competition according to Cerna has as its real name "Call to propose rights for the transfer of land according to the Land Act" and is set up when several candidates are beneficiaries of law.
"These persons propose, as part of the appeal, a higher value of their rights to restitutions that must be settled before the value of the land is announced."
"According to the proposed rights, a classification of the buyers is set up and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights," the spokesman said.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, the information concerning the persons who had registered for the call and since he himself is also a beneficiary because having purchased a large number of rights to restitution, he had proposed to the candidates in the field not to participate in the contest.
And he probably got away with it.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his arrest.
Lubos G. had contacts far above the standards of the FdT (Land Fund).
He was in the case of former FdT chief Vaclav Sankot who was prosecuted for publishing land for which the decision to set up a construction had already been published.
Lubos G. had obtained, for example, land for the construction of public communications, specifically in the place where the access artery to the industrial area of Borske Pole was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the town hall for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far superior.
The town hall was forced to accept because otherwise it risked putting the construction in jeopardy by a blockade of the land.
Households will pay an additional one hundred crowns a month for housing.
Starting in January, households will have to pay a supplement not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rents will also increase.
Families will therefore have to draw up to a hundred crowns monthly from their wallets from January onwards than now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, gas by almost 2 percent more expensive, in some localities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity is expected to be close to 100 kroner per year for households in flats than currently.
However, all suppliers have lowered electricity prices given the significant development in encouraging the production of renewable energies, particularly photovoltaic batteries.
The gas increases moderately but of course at the time when people need it most to heat and therefore have the highest consumption.
One can also count a hundred crowns more.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
It is mainly the largest municipalities that plan the price increase.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay from January for central heating almost 50 crowns more per month, families in Liberec will pay more than 1000 crowns annually.
For the residents of Prague is preparing a 9 percent increase for water and sanitation in case the city increases infrastructure rents.
If the rents do not change, the people of Prague will pay an additional 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still be among the lowest in comparison with the whole country.
In North Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation are up 7.4 percent.
For example, rent prices will increase significantly in the 450 thousand apartments for rent from January onwards, i.e. at the end of the regulation.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns almost 2,500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, has decided to increase by up to 100 percent.
Those who disagree with the new rent increase will be brought before the courts by the company.
The regulated rents people pay in nearly 300,000 apartments could increase by 10 percent next year.
Czech children get drunk on rum and fernet. Beer is no longer fashionable and acts very slowly.
Fernet, rum, vodka and exceptionally also the best brand of whisky are stolen from parents.
These are drinks that most often bring those who get drunk, who are not yet fifteen years old, into the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated in the hospital for recidivism are no exception.
This results from the experience of doctors who encounter cases similar to admissions from children's departments of hospitals.
"Beers or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to get drunk."
“The trend is really strong alcohol,” says Ludek Pelikan, head of the children’s department at the Horovice hospital in central Bohemia.
"When they manage to chip a bottle of popsicle in the closet, it's sometimes about whisky but it's the fernet and vodka that prevail."
“Vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and thus not smell it,” says the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokesperson for the Motol hospital, also gives him reason.
"In general, it's rum or fernet."
"It's the alcohol in fashion today, especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases it was slivovice that they brought back from the house," Jurinova added.
According to Department Chief Pelikan, seeing drunken children between the ages of thirteen and fourteen at hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol where he practiced ten years precisely in pediatrics where ambulances brought schoolchildren from the wide surroundings completely drunk.
A young woman was hospitalized four times.
"She started her career at the age of twelve when she was brought with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in the blood with an additional mixture with ecstasy," the doctor described this particularly important case.
"She was at the Holesovice Exhibition Park at a party."
"What's interesting is that it didn't seem strange to the mother that her daughter was absent for 48 hours," said the Director of the Department astonished.
It is precisely the parents' disinterestedness or their unusual tolerance for their offspring to drink that are the main cause of the development of alcoholism in children.
According to specialists, however, there is no talk of dependence, in its strict sense, for children.
"Under the term alcoholic we hear a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years with all the phenomena that result but that are not found in children."
“For those who use alcohol over and over again, it’s rather a significantly unfavorable socio-familial background,” said Department Chief Pelikan.
According to spokeswoman Jurinova, about forty drunk children were hospitalized this year until mid-November at the pediatric clinic in Motol.
Only cases with severe intoxication requiring hospitalization are included in the statistic.
Drunken children who are after emergency care brought home by parents or police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children who sit down and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, according to Pelikan there are three seasonal waves with which one can count: Witch's Day, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"Either they drink out of spite after bad results or on the contrary they celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
"Of course I experienced at Witch's Day an admission of 7 drunken children at once," Pelikan said.
The drunken child who spent the night in the hospital in detoxification under medical control is paradoxically in a better position than the one who returned home and suffers the next day from the "hangover".
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and a lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body needs.
“They are better off because they have a great evening and then a sweet wake-up call and nothing hurts them.”
“They’re just amazed at where they are,” Pelikan adds, knowing that from time to time it spoils the patients’ good mood at least with the bill to pay for their care.
Ambulance transportation and hospitalization on intensive care beds can go up to tens of thousands of crowns.
“Once in a while, I applied this as a means of education by counting these children how much their drunkenness has cost and that they could spend the entire summer in seasonal work to repay a single evening,” Pelikan added.
However, according to him, the health insurance companies in their regression management, which should recover from the parents the burdens related to care, do not deal with cases of drunk children.
Two L-159 planes are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain.
Two of the five L-159 planes, for which the Ministry of Defense traded Casa C-295M transport planes, took off Tuesday for Seville, Spain, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa-EADS is based.
This is the first time that aircraft of this type have become the property of someone other than the Czech army.
However, they have been abroad as part of exercises or demonstration flights.
These are the two-seater versions of the L-159T1 that were previously in service in the Czech Army and were in flight condition.
The remaining three aircraft are single-seat versions of the L-159.
These are currently parked at Aero Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the firm Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the press department of the Ministry of Defense, the physical departure of the Vodochody planes is currently unknown.
“The L-159 single-seat aircraft planned for the exchange were taken on long-stored aircraft without causing additional charges or investments for the Ministry of Defence.”
"The L-159 T1 two-seaters have been traded in the state," he told Pravo Pejsek.
The ministry signed an agreement with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 for the conversion of four unused L-159 single-seaters into two two-seaters worth 200 million crowns.
The army took delivery of the first aircraft in July, with the second scheduled for delivery later this year.
According to Pejsek EADS is committed to introducing the aircraft into the equipment of some Alliance countries.
“In the contract it is clearly stated that the one who takes the L-159 aircraft into account is EADS and that they will be used to train pilots from NATO member countries.”
"It is therefore the business of the one who is considering how to achieve this," Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa plane and the purchase of three other planes for 3.5 billion crowns was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defence did not launch a tender and contacted EADS directly.
The defence department argued that the exchange ensured a future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 aircraft from Aero Vodochody and only uses 24, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft will likely have legal implications.
However, the European Commission has filed a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence with the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been chosen in the context of a European-wide tender and in no case by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa planes, the last one is expected to arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
A longer index than the ring finger is a sign of low cancer risk
Men who have a longer index than the ring finger are at a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our findings show that the relative length of the finger serves as a simple prostate cancer risk test, especially for men before the age of 60," said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, including by combining with genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health history, Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009 she followed with her colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had the index finger of the right hand shorter than the ring finger.
For them as for the 19 percent of those who had fingers of the same length, we found the same probability of prostate cancer.
In the case of those who had the index longer than the ring finger the risk however fell to 33 percent, for men before 60 the decrease in risk reached 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned - formed during the prenatal period - indicates in particular different levels of sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research had shown that it is precisely testosterone that helps in the development of prostate cancer.
Prof. Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, told CTK that he is aware of the study but does not believe that the relationship between finger length and cancer is "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is in the snow, highways D1 and D5 are closed.
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered in snow this Thursday morning.
On roads and sidewalks, there is mostly compact snow, shredders worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and 93rd kilometres in the direction of Rozvadov due to several truck and car accidents and the D1 highway in Brno towards Prague suffers the same fate.
The dispatcher of the Automobile Club Central (UAMK) told the news
In the 91st kilometre a truck was hit, in the 93rd two heavy trucks were hit, the accident injured.
Several cars also ended up in the ditch.
Problems are also on the D1 motorway at the 185th kilometer in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks crashed there.
Drivers should exit right after Brno at the 190th kilometre or go through Brno and then enter the 182nd kilometre at Kyvalka.
A queue of cars of several kilometers formed at this place.
Also on the D11 motorway, there is an accident and this, just on arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a layer of snow several centimeters thick, thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
For example, there are lines of cars in Prosek, Sterboholska Street is also clogged.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams are delayed, for example, on the line between Charles Square (Karlove Namesti) and Peace Square (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning the Prague crisis staff is yet to meet.
The railways and the airport are also experiencing problems.
The Czech Railways have already had to eliminate 7 rapid links due to snow.
The lines for example from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun have problems
Travellers should monitor the current situation.
Ruzyne airport has been closed since Wednesday 11:00 in the night until 5 a.m.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are already rollable but with increased vigilance.
On the road to Vyskov, three side roads are impassable, on the road to Brno there begins to be snow gusts in places and on the road to Blansko chains are mandatory to pass certain routes of communication in the places placed above.
The Vyskov region was one of the worst-affected places.
So far the axes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them you may need to send snow removers and snow cutters.
We can't estimate when they'll be rollable at the moment.
On the road to Hodonin caution is required in the White Carpathians region.
On the roads that are, in view of the protection of nature, maintained only by the spraying of inert products, there is still a layer of 5 centimeters of snow warns CTK.
In Czechia, it fell between two to 10 centimeters of snow; it fell the most in northern Bohemia, with, often, up to 18 centimeters of snow.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, up to 15 centimeters of snow fell.
The snowfall in Czechia gradually disappears.
Americans have a new “smart weapon”
The U.S. military has sent a new “smart” weapon to Afghanistan, known only as the XM-25 code.
The generals believe that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and will “change the game” to their advantage.
The new weapon is like a super-precise gun
Its projectiles are guided by laser with an accuracy of a few meters.
The special 25 mm calibre ammunition developed for this rifle and containing a highly-breaking explosive, actually works like small grenades.
The munitions can be programmed in such a way that they will explode in contact with the target but also at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
It can therefore be used against an enemy that hides behind an obstacle, a wall or a ditch.
It is also not protected from above and when a deadly rain of steel chips falls on it, it can put it out of combat as well.
According to Richard Audette who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon that uses “smart” technology.
"The soldier essentially uses it in such a way that he finds the target, sends him a laser beam that determines the distance, thus obtaining a precise point of view, according to which he corrects his sight site and presses the detent.
"Let's say you aimed at 543 meters."
"When you press the trigger, the weapon loads and fires at a distance of 543 meters plus or minus 1, 2, 3 meters," Audette said.
400 jobs relocated
The Fujitsu Group relocates its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
Next year in July, 400 employees will move their current workplace to Astro Park at the Mareinbader Square office building in the Bad Homburg area.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocates its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As stated Wednesday by the computer manufacturing and maintenance giant, next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, located so far on Marienbader Square in the city of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, a huge office complex located on Lyoner Straße in Frankfurt’s Niederrad district.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu said that in the medium term, the group is expected to bring together another 100 jobs still scattered so far in the region.
The rental offer has been extremely attractive, and the Astro Park open-plan offices are better suited to the way employees work.
In Bad Homburg too, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
Managing Director Bernd Wagner said: “Frankfurt-Niederrad is a prime location with a remarkable infrastructure for us.”
He says that the connection to the airport is precisely of great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The relocation of a major company within the region yesterday aroused the joy of the winners and caused the disappointment of the losers.
The head of economic affairs of the municipality of Frankfurt, Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a "planetary actor" had been conquered.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith relative to the place of implantation".
Fujitsu is suitable for the city and its location is an important impetus for Niederrad.
Bad Homburg Mayor Michael Korwisi (Greens) regrets Fujitsu’s decision.
Management very early informed the municipality of this intention.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our help to this company," Korwisi said.
However, friendly relations could not have changed the computer manufacturer's difficulties with the owner of the Marienbader Square building.
In the end, the economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now a question of preventing such an exceptional place from remaining unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope that the owner and lessor of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the Town Hall Square building, used so far by Fujitsu and the nearby "small vertical", as well as the rest of the Marienbad Square buildings, were part of the controversial construction project for the spa.
The result of a joint project of the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance to the city was created between the train station and the City Hall, which drew much criticism, not only because of the impressive layout of the surfaces that used to be used in part as parking, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the rating and investment advisory firm, Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, a computer manufacturer at the time still associated with Siemens, moved into the buildings.
In 2006, the German Frankfurt-based Immobilien-Chancen group bought the buildings occupied by Fujitsu along with the Morgan Stanley real estate fund. A year later, these buildings were resold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu Group, headquartered in Tokyo, is considered the third largest supplier of IT products in the world.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides essential service.
Its branch located in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany: Fujitsu has certainly far more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to move to Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiaries on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, 7000 square meters have taken for rent in the Astro Park building.
This twenty-year-old complex, whose name is reminiscent of its star-shaped plan, is home, among other things, to the headquarters of the Confederation of the electronic and electrotechnical industry.
Amazon eviction - Threats against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks is experiencing more and more difficulties.
Internet service provider Amazon has removed the website that specializes in revealing confidential documents from its servers.
This attitude may hide political pressures after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
WikiLeaks founder Assange is apparently in England.
In the United States, WikiLeaks is being attacked with increasing force.
The group of cyber activists "Wikileaks" no longer has access to its server hosted so far in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman has called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, is likely staying in Britain, according to news reports.
"Wikileaks excluded from Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom," the cyber activists behind the revelations said on Wednesday via Twitter.
Shortly before, the cyber company, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks documents from its servers.
After the release of secret diplomatic notes, cyber activists turned to Amazon’s Web Service (AWS) in order to achieve the greatest number of access to documents.
WikiLeaks tweeted: "Formidable, our dollars are now being spent on caring for people in Europe."
When freedom of expression poses a problem for Amazon, “they should stop selling books.”
CNN, citing Mr. Liebermann’s office, reported that Amazon banned Wikileaks from using its servers after the investigation by Senator Joe Lieberman’s associates.
The chairman of the Senate committee for the protection of the territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against him, reported the British newspaper, "The Guardian".
"I would have liked Amazon to take this action earlier in light of Wikileaks' previous classified information releases," he said.
At the same time, Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of servers by the platform.
"WikiLeaks is acting in an illegal, monstrous and unscrupulous manner, putting our national security at risk and endangering our lives around the world," the independent senator said in a statement.
“No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks disseminate the contents of the stolen documents.”
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is wanted by Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol’s wanted list.
According to the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian lives in Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activist has consistently called the Swedish prosecutions orchestrated by his critics intrigues.
WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that threats had been made against the site.
"Calls have even been launched for the murder of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange is particularly concerned for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
This is also why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson clearly reacted to statements made in North America.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee has demanded that the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s adviser said on television, obviously ironically, that Mr Assange should “be killed” and that Mr Obama could “use a drone.”
Meanwhile, a controversy broke out between the White House and Mr. Assange.
U.S. President Barack Obama’s spokesman Robert Gibbs called it “ridiculous and absurd” that Mr. Assange demanded Secretary of State Hilary Clinton’s resignation if she was responsible for the recently disclosed order to diplomats to engage in espionage activities.
“I don’t know exactly why we need to deal with the opinion of an individual website owner,” Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than the claims of a website.”
The U.S. government is now completely testing the protection of its databases.
According to a White House statement, Russell Travers, deputy director of the Counter-Terrorism Centre, has been appointed as the leak control officer.
Travers is tasked with implementing "the necessary structural reforms" made indispensable after Wikileaks leaked the diplomatic cables.
The White House also has the will to verify the means by which the entire administration exchanges and protects information.
In addition, the U.S. government has announced that it wants to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists should they ever be threatened by the Wikileaks revelations.
"We have made every effort to get in touch with them," State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice
At the Gelato University in Bologna, ice cream confectioners are prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day initiation course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
By the way, where does all the ice come from?
Glacier and ice machine.
The glacier, that is to say in German the somewhat outdated ice confectioner, makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of making ice.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated showcase using a spatula, places it in the waffle and then starts selling it.
To find out, one does not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice, can not avoid "Gelato-University" of the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The ice cream maker founded the University of Ice Cream in 2003 so that the ice creams from its machines meet high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day introductory course for future glaciers was a great success and attracted visitors from all over the world.
Special courses on chocolate ice cream are also offered over several days, as well as hands-on sessions in the private ice cream parlor.
In the midst of the quarantine crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others simply risk fulfilling their burning desire on smooth ice.
This time, 40 participants came from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia to Hungary.
Jacky, an artistic education teacher from California, is a fan of the Slow Food movement and wants to offer a quality European product in the future in the country of Industrial Ice.
Anke from Berlin is a business management consultant and after a few years she wants to draw something unique from this nerve-wracking job.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening a glacier in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian maid came because her children love Italian ice cream.
Master glacier Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of perfect ice creams.
Determinant is not only good taste, but also silky suppleness and good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the training the cherry on the cake of the national and, in general, southern superstructure: "Italian ice is simply the best: and then it still retains a hell of a dose of romanticism."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats everything to 85 degrees through an electronic program, then immediately cools to four degrees.
He then opens a faucet installed on the machine: he comes out a pasteurized white cream base, the foundation of all kinds of milk ice cream.
The trainer is immediately beset with the question: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can we give free rein to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr. Luciano warns against being misled by the spirit of time.
Anyone who talks only about ice cream "made from natural ingredients" may have used stabilizers: most often a natural product, for example guar seed flour obtained from guar beans.
It is obviously possible to make ice without using a stabilizer, only it has to be sold within 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the customer will not chew anything other than ice granules.
Some modifications of the base mass are allowed.
It gets more exciting with the aromas.
Master Luciano makes the difference between the ingredients you buy in the fruit or confectionery department of the supermarket.
In addition, there is powder and pasta.
"the suppliers will all try to give you dozens of flavored ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
Either in the recipes of fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Either in ice creams made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs, becomes a yellow cream and forms, when cocoa powder is added, the basis of all possible chocolate desserts.
Now all participants in the course have to move to the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to make four kinds of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural ingredients.
The different kinds of fruit ice cream are also subjected to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purees: from the point of view of taste, this is not absolutely better.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily have the taste of nuts, when it consists largely of hazelnuts.
Kiwi ice cream, very popular, is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
“Only a balanced blend correctly matches the taste of an ice cream,” says Luciano.
Making ice cream is a calculation exercise: if you use peach puree with a lot of sugar, you need to reduce the amount of sugar in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is required for lemon ice cream.
Luciano presents a device with which he determines the sugar content of the different types of fruit (the winemakers use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make calculations easier.
The manufacture of ice does not require as much physical intervention as in the past.
It is not only the automatic mass-making machine that helps.
There is also an apparatus in which the available ice mixture is simultaneously beaten to make it smooth and reduced to negative temperatures.
Despite all the automations, slight breakdowns are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo scrambles with fruit puree from head to toe and, thus, splashes his fellow students when control of the colossal mixing bowl escapes him.
Master Luciano is of the opinion that "such an incident is likely to occur in each class: it is only a matter of time."
Controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry that experiments with the cultivation of genetically modified plants has nucleated the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now made by the Testbiotech expert group, which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
“It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we did a lot of research,” said Christoph Then, Head of Testbiotech, in Munich on Wednesday.
Some reports indicate that the chairman of the EFSA Group of Experts on Genetically Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, as well as other EFSA experts are under contract with the Ilsi lobby group.
The latter is financed by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has been instrumental in developing EFSA's testing requirements for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a conflict of interest situation, according to Mr. Then's criticisms.
The provisions drawn up correspond, in paragraphs, to the positions taken by the Ilsi pressure group and thus bear the trade mark of the industry which, at bottom, would be controlled by the authorities established in Parma, Italy.
This is already the second time that Testbiotech has denounced a conflict of interest.
A senior Efsa official has recently joined the Swiss agri-food group Syngenta unconditionally or without a transitional period, and in doing so, she has changed sides.
Not long ago, even the Central German Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relations between the European Union authority in charge of control and the industrial lobby, which aroused the suspicions of both the German Federal Environment Agency and MEPs.
However, the EFSA does not accept the existence of any conflict of interest.
One opinion indicates that all reliable data, including industry data, are used as long as they are of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of EFSA are not prohibited from making contact with this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the U.S.-based International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI).
This body sees itself as a neutral forum for experts from, among others, the fields of science, industry and policy to assess the risks of biotechnology without being on the payroll of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then disapprove of the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any feeding tests in animals and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We want to know what are, for example, the incidences of genetically modified maize causes in the field," says Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins and not all genetically modified plants, which does not provide reliable results.
"If we don't look for risks, how can we find them?" asked Mr. Then in an accusing tone.
This is also the view of Mrs Angelika Hilbeck.
She has been researching genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Polytechnic School.
In this region as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry sector is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
That is why there are hardly any researchers who are not linked to societies.
In the opinion of the companies, the critical studies would not be published.
Hilbeck says that “the industry controls safety research.”
The trace of stone
Uli Gsell got it, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday afternoon, she was standing in front of Stuttgart station with her tube on her back.
There was a demonstration.
It was snowing.
The story is known: In September, the excavators had come and started demolishing much of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: Several thousand people protested against the S21 project, the transformation of Stuttgart Central Station into an underground station that will cost billions.
Much of the wing was in ruins when the demonstrations led to the cessation of construction work.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (the shell limestone) of Crailsheim, a soft and coarse pavement badly built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor residing in Ostfildern.
He obtained a few fragments.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He enthusiastically declares: "a modest and cheap rock, simple and terrestrial."
He claimed that by sawing it, he smelled the smoke of cigarettes.
He does not yet know what he will do with this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The traces of the Stuttgart stones lead to a former French army ammunition depot in a forest near Tübingen, where Manuel Rongen built his empire of stones.
This 44-year-old man trades in old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
“It would be a shame if they were crushed or disappeared in the landfill,” he said in his office in a hut, which was once a guard post.
He said he was insulted and threatened when newspapers reported in September that he had bought the rest of the north wing from the demolition company.
But he negotiated for whole days with the opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that he could do nothing at all to oppose the demolition.
And if it happens, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue using the stones.
Approximately 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently took one of the stone parallelepiped weighing on average 80 kilos whose value is between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a souvenir in while also hoping to be able to return it during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full truck loads.
About half is still crammed into the forest, with the rest long since sold.
Owners of gardens, landscape gardeners, Individuals.
They came from everywhere and took everything that could get into the trunk and the trailers.
These Stuttgart scandal stones have long since been transformed into "Mäuerle" or limitations of grass beds.
“By the way, this stone is nothing special,” Rongen said.
"It would not have been this political component."
He enters his all-terrain car, makes the rounds of his vast empire of 20 hectares.
He studied law and later began to study biology before becoming interested in computer science and eventually became a career.
And a stone lover.
It stores 40,000 tons.
He amassed his treasures all over Germany.
He claims to be the greatest merchant of ancient stones.
He's slowing down.
Artfully carved sandstones are laid on the snow.
"In the past, they were part of the Marienbrücke bridge in Dresden."
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he says enthusiastically.
"My favorite stone."
He takes the path that goes up through the forest.
He shows a pile of his finger: Red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe station.
And so on.
"Beautiful travertine."
The parallelepiped was once part of the grandstand of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, the Cannstatt travertine from the police prefecture, the reddish granite from St. Blasius Cathedral, the tuff from Heilbronn Hospital.
What work, what efforts, what sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that the stones were once carved by hand and moved using simple hoists and carts pulled by oxen, he becomes quite respectful.
“It would be a scandal if such a legacy were torn apart.”
He didn’t get rich, much less rich.
But this carrier now employs 14 people. In addition, stonecutters, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassblower and a gardener have settled in the forest.
“We’re working hard, but it’s rewarding,” says the waste recycler.
Soon, he has to go to Cologne.
There are stones to be saved, too.
Talent Struggle to Conquer High Potentials
The counter is experiencing a strong affluence.
16 students are scrambling to buy salmon loaves, tomato sauce, and bleachers.
The Braunschweig Technical University and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited design and mechanical engineering students to a workshop.
As part of a kind of competition of ideas, they have to talk business about the car of the future with the designers of VW, and, by the way, get to know the firm Volkswagen.
Nowadays, many companies do not hesitate to go hand-in-hand in the competition to find better brains and to engage, like Volkswagen, in multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Recruit the most gifted graduates as much as possible in the amphitheatres before they reach the job market and are courted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements about the performance of their students, we try to identify and retain outstanding talent in practical projects.
On the second day of the workshop held at the Technical University of Brauschweig, the automotive group encouraged talents.
A young lady from the staff service shares pens, candy and cards with the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the calendar of professional internships and student jobs for young talents; she shows them the paths to access the group enclosure.
Nico Selle from the Technical University of Braunschweig is responsible for the project with Volkswagen.
For him, there are reciprocal advantages for both parties: "Students come into contact with this industrial sector and gain experience."
"As for the Volkswagen Group, he can get to know the students, look more closely at the serious candidates and appreciate those who come into play as collaborators."
According to Mr. Saddle, such cooperation is unusual.
What's new is the offensive we're trying to attract students with.
"In the past, the focus was more on the professional project," says Selle.
The struggle for the conquest of the new graduates will become much harsher.
In many industries, companies are no longer able to recruit employees by sorting a number of candidates.
But they must boast their reliability and above all court the highly skilled workforce.
It is mainly graduates from engineering backgrounds who find themselves in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the German engineering association VDI, more than 40,000 engineering positions remained unoccupied in October.
And according to VDI forecasts, the gap in engineering positions will widen further.
Roman Dykta goes on a talent hunt for KPMG, an audit, accounting and consulting firm.
It organizes expensive events aimed at recruiting talent, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a kind of paper rally where competitors must find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year to travel the U.S. in this way.
Participants can also visit KPMG’s subsidiaries and get to know the company.
The person who is to participate is decided in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the cream of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Dykta, the means used for the quest for high potentials in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the crowd thanks to the cruise race."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little"
For the talent hunter Mr. Dykta, the account seems to be there.
"To this day, we have remained in touch with all those who took part in a similar action last year."
"Some of them are about to finish their studies and want to address their requests to our company soon," he says.
Apart from direct taming on campus, small and medium-sized businesses proceed in a very classic way by participating in trade fairs where they engage in the hunt for brains.
"We try to reach graduates by participating in trade shows."
“For example, at the solar technology show,” says Sitha Stübe, director of human resources at Solarworld, a manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
The Bonn-based company employs around 1500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stübe is aware of the issue of succession.
There are currently 35 positions on the company's website.
"Right now, it's very difficult to fill vacancies."
“It’s expensive and takes a lot of time,” he says.
Another way to establish contact is to go through university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, for example, the University of Freiburg.
"The professors indicate that the student has the opportunity to do professional internships or to write his final project with us."
Expensive advertising campaigns are announced at solar specialists.
This is why the company tries to advertise by highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
“Often, a large group cannot do that,” says Stübe, chief of staff.
For a long time, money has no longer played the leading role in the search for work.
Other determinants are flexible working hours, childcare or good promotion opportunities.
According to a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranks 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute is an annual honours table of German employers.
To this end, it asks employees about their level of satisfaction with their work and its context while looking at the employee’s framework conditions.
Chief of Staff Ms. Stübe hopes that this placement will enhance the company's image among jobseekers.
“I think candidates rely mostly on external assessments of a potential employer,” she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Academy DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Academy, DEBA) advises companies who wish to build a good reputation as an employer by implementing a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr Kriegler, this means first and foremost taking internal action.
“The best way for an employer to make itself attractive is to go through its own employees,” he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the employer's brand image within its own workforce.
"satisfied collaborators are the best messengers."
When they treat their employees well and identify with the company, they advertise their employer to their friends and acquaintances on their own.
“It’s like playing in an orchestra,” says Mr. Kriegler.
Obama puts a brake on new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, the southeastern state of the United States, in the coming years.
The Washington government has issued an equivalent ban and thus definitively overturned its initial plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling is currently prohibited.
Home Secretary Ken Salazar made the announcement Wednesday.
The explosion in April of the drilling rig "Deepwater Horizon" is the cause of this strict ban, which must remain in force for at least the next five years.
Faced with the accident, which cost the lives of eleven employees and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and this sector of activity, indicated that he was willing to authorize the realization of new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The proponents of this solution want to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign countries when it comes to the supply of oil.
The question of who bears the responsibility for the devastating oil spill in golf is not, to date, definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which is facing multi-billion dollar claims, is at the center of the charges.
A commission of inquiry set up by Obama is due to present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar lifted the freeze on the drilling decree after the platform exploded.
As a result of this decision, various oil companies had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and tougher security guidelines, Obama and Salazar want to prevent another catastrophe.
The competent supervisory authority, which has discredited itself after numerous corruption allegations, is currently undergoing in-depth reforms.
At the same time, Obama announced that he would remove the lucrative tax niches of oil and gas groups.
The players in this sector now publicly warn that the flow rate in the Gulf would be significantly lower than it has been so far.
"The government's goal is to put a brake on the rapid growth of the oil and gas sector," according to the result of a current survey of the sector by the audit firm BDO, ahead of the drilling ban imposed on Wednesday.
In fact, the American Enery Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "No one knows exactly what will change with regulation."
Investments in new support projects were deferred until further notice, to the detriment of growth.
The Ogoni country is dry
The water that flows in the rivers is oiled brown; it emits a smell similar to that which exists in the gas station: Due to a leak, billions of liters of crude oil have destroyed the Ogoni country in Nigeria.
Men live on theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
“Don’t get exhausted,” the environmental activist tells reporters to calm them: “You still have enough oil mud in front of the water lens today.”
The 37-year-old Nigerian attempted to photograph a young man plunged into muddy water up to his chest, as well as the greasy trail that surrounds him: This scene looks almost beautiful in the burst of rainbow-colored water.
We cannot see that the subsoil is full of brown layers of crude oil.
On the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom says she once collected shrimp in whole buckets here.
But in the meantime the calm waters have completely dried up.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil came from an oil pipeline that exploded in the huge swamp.
Fishermen in the nearby small town of Bodo must now row for six hours to reach the fishy waters: The Ogoni country located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The full extent of the devastation comes to light as we traverse the mangrove swamps crossed by streams.
Instead of clear water, the motorboat splits a crabby brown water. Anyone who dips his hand in it removes it completely covered with oil.
The roots of small mangroves emerge from the ground like liquorice sticks. The isolated palms sadly let their palms hang.
Bird clouds are sought in vain, as they are usually found in wetlands: As soon as the outboard engine stops, a ghostly silence descends on this paradise of yesteryear that resembles a gas station by the smell it emits.
"What is happening here is a war on the environment," says Celestine Akpobari sadly: "Our life is characterized by a permanent danger to health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where the Ogoni live has been a battlefield besieged for decades: More than 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. this was later executed. In 1993, the Shell group had to stop its production activities in this region because they had become very dangerous.
Even today, the return to Ogoni country is forbidden to this company: While more than 2 million barrels of black gold are pumped daily thanks to more than 5,000 drilling wells and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines throughout the Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, the oil fields of Ogoni country are untapped, because the situation is unstable for this tropier.
Every few hundred meters, steel trellises stand in the water like bizarre sculptures: The heads of drill holes are affectionately referred to as "Christmas trees".
They are up to 50 years old, most are gnawed by corrosion to the mark.
Akpobari believes that a drill head of this nature breaks down from time to time in pieces, as a constant flow of crude oil flows into the water.
According to experts’ estimates, more than two billion liters have spilled into the ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the amount of oil equivalent to that which flowed into the sea during the “Exxon Valdez” supertanker accident 21 years ago off Alaska, one of the largest environmental disasters in human history.
Who should be responsible for persistent environmental pollution? the answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell Group, oil pipeline sabotage and siphoning are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, while environmentalists see drilling head explosions and drilled oil pipelines as the main causes.
In 2008, U.S. researcher Richard Steiner accused Shell of applying substantially less stringent safety standards in Nigeria than anywhere else in the world: Only the rate of pipeline failures is "even higher than elsewhere".
Some forms emerge from the mangroves in a place that, seen from afar, looks like an abandoned workshop, full of clams and installed in the open air: They are completely naked and covered with clams to the neck.
A fire sparkles under one of the many barrels that sometimes connected to the pipes, sometimes scattered without motive on the site must be spotted: a small clandestine refinery.
The crude oil is heated in the barrel for several hours, explains Michael, the team leader.
Initially, gasoline enters a container through pipes, then at the end of the pipe the kerosene drops fall and diesel is finally obtained.
This is how Michael and his four collaborators produce four 300-litre diesel barrels a day: "This brings us 34,000 Naira", about 22 dollars.
Delta residents are taking advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in Africa’s largest oil-producing country.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a lower price than the ridiculously low price of just 40 cents per litre of Diesel: because they buy their raw material for free.
This is offered by the "protectors" who are putting the network of oil pipelines through all the Ogoni country. According to experts, the country loses in this way at least 16 million liters of crude oil in the entire Niger Delta.
Only a very small portion of the provisionally stored raw material is illegally purified: Organized crime networks, which also include high-ranking politicians and military members, load the lion’s share into tankers and bray it into the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers that the debate on whether to attribute environmental disaster or rather subversive activities to the population or to the lax mode of production is purely academic.
“If oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if the foundations of fishermen’s lives were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, no theft and illegal refineries.”
But, in the meantime, Ogoni's relations, especially with Shell, have deteriorated so much that it was no longer a question of the group's withdrawal. "perhaps operators with other nationalities, such as the Chinese, will prove better."
Michael is getting nervous.
"It's high time you got out," the sturdy oil worker announces.
"Soldiers can appear at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be arrested, but at most they will offer bribes.
Even soldiers mostly from the north of the country want to take advantage of the raw material like all Nigerians.
“In any way, this damn thing has brought our country down to a very low level,” Akpori said.
Investigators discover construction defects in A380 reactors
The A380 clearly suffers from a major safety problem.
Examining an aircraft that made an emergency landing, investigators discovered a possible construction defect that can lead to “catastrophic reactor failure.”
The airline Qantas now wants to file a complaint against the manufacturer of the reactor.
At the beginning of November, the passengers of the Airbus belonging to the company Quantas had visibly had until now more luck: During the investigation that it conducted, the Australian aviation safety authority found that the reactors of some A380 aircraft presented a serious safety problem, and it warns of a possible construction failure.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: It can cause fatigue cracks and leaks at the oil pipe connection, according to a statement released Thursday by the ATSB administration.
It could have led to a "catastrophic reactor failure".
These include the Rolls-Royce-built reactors, which are equipped with 20 A380 series aircraft.
The Quantas Airbus, which had to land on November 4 in Singapore, is among them.
The Australian airline has now filed lawsuits against the British manufacturer of reactors.
She filed a legal complaint with an Australian federal court based in Sydney, giving her the opportunity to take further legal action against the company.
Quantas director Alan Joyce said his company would claim damages in connection with the incident in early November.
Parts were detached and the bearing surface was damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is oil inflammation that causes the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors now need to be replaced in the world.
Australian investigators have announced that further safety-related tests will be carried out on the superjumbos that are also equipped with the reactors in question.
The safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ASTB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The security issue is considered to be sufficiently important to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of its plane, the airline Quantas had grounded its entire fleet of A380s for a week.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily immobilized three of its eleven A380s.
As a precautionary measure, Lufthansa has replaced the reactor of an A380.
The double-decker is the largest airliner in the world.
Snowfall across the country is causing transport chaos
Germany all covered in white: In one night, snow fell on almost the whole country.
Chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are immobilized.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter makes Germany sizzle: Due to freezing temperatures, almost the entire republic is covered with snow on Thursday night, which leads to chaos in many localities.
To the north and east, snow cover reaches 15 centimeters in places.
Traffic is severely restricted on several motorways and on many roads.
On the A7 in Flensburg, the winter service staff worked on a permanent basis, but they were unable to cope with the snow that kept piling up.
In addition, violent gusts swept the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (FSO) expects tidal waves to occur along the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels of up to 1.2 m above normal.
Snow piles on highways and federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
That's why the weather warning center Meteomedia announced the level of purple alert was announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it is the highest level.
In some places, 30 centimetres of fresh snow fell and the strong, cool winds dispersed.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there at night.
Even in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, the police authorities announced serious disruptions on the roads.
On the A2 motorway, snow and wind caused traffic disruption and traffic jams.
In Thuringia, snowfall hit the A4 and A9 motorways.
According to the Deutsche Bahn, serious disruptions to rail traffic occurred in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on railways, fallen trees on railways, catenaries or destroyed needles.
In Saxony, interregional transport between Leipzig and Nuremberg had to be interrupted.
In Sallfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train bound for Munich had to interrupt its journey.
Firefighters and paramedics had to supply the train’s 165 passengers with blankets, food and drinks.
Snow winds swept the roads.
Snowfall has resulted in numerous flight cancellations at Germany’s major airports.
According to a spokesman for the standard and flight information, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A Fraport spokesman says 40 flights have already been canceled in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service ensures a permanent service.
It is true that there are no longer many passengers stuck at the airport, although only 400 beds are available.
Accidents occurred Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life in a collision with a train at a crossing.
The train driver was slightly injured.
Due to the layers of snow on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was caught at a crossing because the vehicle was immobilized there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured on the train, which is why the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until early morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car blew up on a slippery road in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists are announcing good news: The snow will certainly always be soft and powdery, but it will swirl in case of slight gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be afflicted by strong and rapid winds.
It is very cold, however, up to minus 15 degrees in places.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers.
The Deutsche Bank seeks to secede from its emblem: According to reports in newspapers, the financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings located at its Frankfurt headquarters.
This building could earn up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just refurbished the headquarters of the group: The twin towers located in the business district have been modernized; in the meantime, the bankers have had to return to their former place of service.
From now on, the financial group is clearly looking to recover the costs of renovations and is looking for a buyer for its two buildings, as the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland" writes, citing a spokesman.
This spokesperson did not state the reasons for the planned sale.
He said "we are checking if it is more interesting to occupy the buildings ourselves or to sell them, and to put them on lease again later."
Thus, Germany’s largest financial institution has already relinquished its seat, shortly after.
It was only in mid-2007 that the bank acquired the twin towers for €272 million from the equity holders and then rehabilitated them.
The transformations aimed at energy optimization have, according to some indications, swallowed about 200 million euros.
A sale would obviously bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, experts in this sector of activity estimate the value of the towers, renamed in the meantime "Green Towers", at about 500 million Euros.
According to the spokesman, it is not currently known whether the buildings will be sold again to a bank-owned fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourn the miners who perished.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people had a thought for the buried miners who were declared dead as a result of several explosions in a mine.
The bodies had not yet been recovered because the security situation at the well continued to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
Twenty-nine minors between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried underground.
A probe had been introduced into the wrecked well, but no trace of survivors had been discovered.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that followed, no rescue team was able to descend into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and administration had considered that the miners no longer had any chance of survival.
Until now, the bodies could not be recovered.
Today, relatives and friends have organized a party in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered under the bright sun at Greymouth in the south of the island of New Zealand.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 miners buried, 29 tables were installed on which the names, helmets and lamps could be seen.
Photos and personal effects, including clothing and surfboards, also had their place.
The flags were lashed in front of all public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told commemorative party attendees that New Zealand has nurtured hope that miners will rise to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew whose Zen son was buried in the pits said he cannot resign himself to accepting the death of his son until he has seen his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative celebration.
Miners of South African and British descent also buried during the first explosion on 19 November.
Rescuers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
Police Prefect Gary Knowles told reporters that when the explosive gas masses are moved, the burning temperatures inside the mine begin to drop.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is the Splatter film an artificial film?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the old genre with his film, "Walhalla Rising", an epic of the fighter.
What audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when filming "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) possessing only one eye is taken prisoner; he frees himself from his executioner and, with an almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents one after the other. This seems ideal for young male spectators looking for a bloody action, precisely because our hero is using methods of assize.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the blind man says no words about his real name. Even the other characters let escape, at most, at the detour of one or two sentences some terrible cries of agony.
Otherwise, we say nothing and feast in the incredibly beautiful mountain landscape of Scotland that is the setting of the Viking universe, about a thousand years ago.
It would be ideal more mature filmmakers having an interest in existentialism and for excellent travellings.
When a film targets several target groups, it is a pity that they exclude each other.
The director Winding Refn is considered, since the release of "Pusher", his trilogy related to the fierce and full of style drug trafficker, as a kind of Danish Quentin Tarantino, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the mainstream or introduce a little less brutality to the art cinema and essay.
Most art cinema sympathizers must experience horror in the face of the brain spreading all around and to the intestines.
Action movie lovers die of boredom when the blind man embarks, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries on a ship bound for Jerusalem; they are drowned for an eternity by the calm and mist before the crew arrives in America and continues to be silent.
It is not surprising then that "Walhalla Rising" has not found any distributor of films in Germany and that it exists only in DVD format.
It is mainly because of the magnificent images of misery that deserved some attention, but also because the image of a thrilling film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
These are not dialogues in this film, nor a coherent action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream turned into a film.
The spectator cannot escape it.
Refn barely gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with icy images and a gloomy soundtrack, but above all with an elusive hatred that springs from the heart of the characters.
Only a young blond boy, who stands faithfully by the side of the blind, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are animated by anger.
More than anything, the blind hero whose motives are never known, but who comes back from hell at any time to fight enemies and temporarily allies by transforming himself into a warrior, is perhaps the devil's envoy himself.
It represents rot, but perhaps also, only for those who are, anyway, rotten.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that can be hated or admired, whose purpose is annoyance, enthusiasm and astonishment.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications regarding a nuclear program developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on this issue, much less submit to the agency's controls.
On the night of 5-6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic-shaped building on Syrian territory.
It is located on the bank of the Euphrates; the largest city located nearby is 30 kilometers: it is Dair as-Sur.
His name appears in the IAEA documents, because it is about the reactor that Syria has built with the help of North Korea in stone parallelepiped, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of electricity.
According to a briefing by the US intelligence services, the CIA, dating from the end of April 2008, the current reactor, known as the neighboring locality, el-Kibar, would be well able to produce plutonium, which would make atomic weapons.
On the other hand, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a video presentation with fuzzy satellite images.
Through computer-aided animation, it indicated the likely location of each reactor component prior to the destruction of the plant, which represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the building located nearby, even inside it.
It appears that the reactor was about to be commissioned, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, we have little more information than at the time, and even, with time, the mystery thickens more and more.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that prior to the attack, the CIA was certain that Syria had built a reactor at al-Kibar, but had little evidence that the country was developing an “active nuclear weapons program.”
Some intelligence officers in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and speak only of a “supposed reactor,” even if they consider the CIA’s presentation “plausible.”
They lack tangible evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked how he ensures he is dealing with a nuclear reactor, a senior U.N. diplomat gave only a laconic response in the summer by claiming that the IAEA had “enough documents to ask questions.”
The Syrians certainly hastily removed the rubble of the “unused military building” and proceeded to methodically flatten the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen discovered traces of man-made uranium in al-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA has received through a member state satellite images of commercial providers showing the moment that directly followed the attack. it seems that the latter are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, possibly Israel, acquired them exclusively.
This makes it impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always assured that it had never carried out a secret atomic program and had not built a reactor.
Damascus claims that the uranium found at the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA rejected this argument after the particle analysis, calling it implausible.
Since that time, damasus has refused any discussion about this, as well as about satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow controllers to conduct a second inspection at the al-Kibar site and refuses access to the wreckage of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel keeps a stubborn silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in office at the time of the attack, recently said: "We will never comment on this."
Thus, the investigation into this case has dragged on since June 2008 without a result and "becomes increasingly a serious problem of credibility of the Agency", as recognized by a high-ranking Western diplomat on duty at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, in the end it is a serious violation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.
The IAEA believes that in order to make progress, the existence of the other three facilities that must have "a functional relationship" with the alleged reactor must be clarified.
So far, the inspectors have not indicated what facilities are here, what their function is or what they are suspected to contain.
According to information published by the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung", they are known within the IAEA respectively as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariyah also by the names of the neighboring cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington has identified these locations and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that would most likely be one of the suspicious objects.
It is possible that it is located in a military base or directly next to it; this is exactly why Syria is denying the IAEA inspectors access to all three sites.
In Vienna, it is claimed that Syrians fear that the inspection group is actually spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on military facilities.
In fact, it was intelligence provided by U.S. secret agents that caught the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have shuttled between the three sites and the stone parallelepiped to transport substances.
A senior Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could be “used for fuel production.”
It would have "no indication of sensitive activities", such as uranium enrichment and reprocessing; processes that are essential for the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works thanks to unenriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there are plausible hypotheses regarding the following fundamental questions: where should uranium have come from and where plutonium needed to make the bomb would have been separated later.
It is not known whether the rubble, which could hide traces of great value, was stored at all three sites.
When the hundreds of trucks loaded with land are gone, no one will have information on where the rubble is stored.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria had the al-Tibni salt mine, located only a few kilometres from al-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, examined in 1998 to see if it could be suitable for the storage of radioactive waste.
Recently analyzing satellite photos taken on behalf of the famed Jane's Intelligence Review magazine, former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley established a link between them and the reactor in question.
Satellite photos show, however, that Syria undertook earthworks at the three suspect sites and moved huge containers when the IAEA began demanding access to those locations.
It is possible that this was a coincidence, but it did not help rule out the suspicions.
It is said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for the inspections to be carried out there. This plan was to allow Syria to preserve possible military secrets. Only the time invested shows how much interest the inspectors have in this case.
Meanwhile, Damascus also ignored this proposal.
A year ago, if Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the urgency would not be signaled for this case, says, for example, Glyn Davies, the US ambassador who has been referring for a few months to what is known as the special inspections, one of the most powerful means available to the Atomic Agency to implement its control.
The Director of the IAEA, Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has certainly already spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but he is still hesitant.
This means carries a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Governing Council and many of the 35 countries represented there have no desire to see the situation escalate.
On the other hand, like this diplomat who gives to reflect: "It would be useful for this, if in the end they find nothing"
Love in Time of War
It’s been a long time since Angelina Jolie made her directorial debut in the summer.
She wrote the script herself: it’s a love story between a Bosnian woman and a man of Serbian origin.
Nothing more is known about this story, but it is enough to cause discomfort.
A persistent rumor indicates that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian executioner during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women’s federations immediately protested, in response, some of the filming sequences planned in Sarajevo were moved at the last minute to Hungary.
In the meantime, the film is shot in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests continue in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the Women Victims of War organization sent a correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and she demanded to meet with the actress. Jolie herself is a goodwill ambassador of UNHCR.
She is not a diplomat; a few weeks ago, she proposed to these women to meet with them in Hungary, but they declined that offer.
"The meeting must be held in Bosnia," Hasecic said.
There have been no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie’s script says a lot about her attitude toward the victims.
The Guardian reports that Hasecic's organization subsequently recommended that the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights remove Angelina Jolie as a goodwill ambassador.
But, by the way, what kind of script did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which has received copies of its script, has, after some hesitation, granted a filming permit in Sarajevo, but it is not known why it did not come later despite this authorization.
The young author herself assures that she does not pursue political objectives with her film, that it is by making a lot of effort that she became aware of the Yugoslav conflict, she argues that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and give the opportunity to all stakeholders to express themselves.
However, it remains vague about the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net. It is quite different: The lovers knew each other well before the beginning of the war. They meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guard.
Which is still a big difference with the version "a rape victim falls in love with her executioner".
That Jolie's movie started long before the war, of course.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is “unfair and based on misinformation.”
From now on, only Hollywood fanatics can bring him peace: by illegally putting this scenario on the Net, like many others before.
Let's shoot!
Tonight, all is well with the Irish.
There is no trace of consternation.
This is why the local team overpowers visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
The fans are screaming with joy against a background of loud music, they tread on their feet.
Baileyu-Pub from Cork in southern Ireland vibrates because players throw and manage to drop table tennis balls at a distance of three meters into opposing team beer cups.
This bizarre show is called "beer pong". The winner pockets 500 Euros plus a plane ticket allowing him to attend in January in Las Vegas at the world championship of beer pong.
Cian Tanner is a calm individual; this subtle drinking game and the reserved computer scientist, these two behaviors really do not go well together.
And yet, despite this, the 26-year-old seeks to have fun, to turn away from the quivering question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not part of his plans, and in January he will lead job interviews in New Zealand.
“I have a strange feeling,” he says.
“My homeland is so far away and I don’t have a job.”
Finally: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland, "in less than two, she got her desired job as an event project manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man smiling.
Due to the bleak prospects in the country, two of Tanner's three sisters tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, lives in Sydney, and his brother Colin now works as a computer consultant in London.
The situation of most of the families living on the island is similar to that of the tanners.
Experts from the Institute for Economic and Social Research indicate that 100,000 Irish will soon leave their country.
They even predict a number of 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
This is a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million people.
If these forecasts come true, it will be a emigration trend comparable to that suffered by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom in which the Irish enjoyed great ease, grief now takes over.
The economic crisis, however, mainly affects well-trained young Irish people, who have so far experienced only moments of happiness.
The loss of jobs and social decline seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there's too much money.
But in the meantime, three out of every ten people under the age of 30 are unemployed.
The Irish Times publishes extensively the letters of readers written by young emigrants, who complain: "In Ireland, everything goes adrift."
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but whoever has the chances, goes away and so does our country for an entire generation.”
"The last one to leave turns off the light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a darker future because the government is just throwing dust in the eye and offering no future prospects for young people.
“They are cutting minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs,” says the 20-year-old.
She sees how her comrades cling from one unpaid practical internship to another.
She declares that are her biggest concern is to emigrate herself in four years.
"It's a sad and depressing thought."
However men like Stephen McLarnon try to approach this topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo" which offers comprehensive support on the theme "working abroad".
"But working abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for newcomers to take the first steps in the professional hierarchy," he said.
Its website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a mess, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For six months, Se<0xC3><0xA1>n O'Donovan has known what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was nothing left to do in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector and Germany.
A fashion house comes out of the ground in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other projects in Hanover and Berlin.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely visits his native country, as he participates in an additional job, so that he can finish repaying the credit contracted to build his home in his native country.
“The situation is already a little crazy,” he says as he crosses the threshold of his home for the first time in a long time.
“I make money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I hardly live anymore.”
He bursts out with embarrassed laughter as he passes through the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-kept front gardens, expensive cars of major brands are parked on the access roads.
Four years ago, O’Donovan bought the house jointly with his sister for an amount of 380,000 Euros, financed 100 percent by the credit.
“These were moments of madness, no doubt, money was easy,” he says.
Is he afraid of seeing everything fall apart because of credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, pours hot tea and says, "I don't have children to care for and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The building engineer does not like the lamentations that he often hears lately.
“No one should suffer from hunger, yet our situation is not as dramatic as what we once experienced here on the island,” he said.
“Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen, maybe that’s what makes us feel Irish first.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last great economic crisis.
“He was back after seven years and in Ireland life just went on.”
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leaving the future and discovering how life goes on elsewhere.
In his list, He already has a few years of work in London. That is why life should not be so easy in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend.
But there is still one thing that worries him very much in recent days: the party to be organized on the occasion of its 27th anniversary in Dublin.
He fears that it may turn into a farewell night.
“Only, not a lot of emotions,” he said while drinking a long sip of beer.
“Goodbye, but that sounds scary.”
"Let's call it a good-bye party, all relaxed, bringing a few friends together, with a few drinks and a few games."
The Democratic Routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as does support for private enterprise.
Crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latinobar<0xC3><0xB3>metro survey taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
As the survey has been conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it tracks changes in attitudes in the region.
Two related elements emerge from this year's survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the rather sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the South American Pacific (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6 per cent per year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a minimum of 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy recovered after suffering a sharp drop in output last year.
But only about half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, lowering the regional average (see Table 2).
Some 44% of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way their country's democracy worked in practice; this is the same number as last year but with a sharp increase from 25% in 2001 (Figure 3).
Some 34 per cent said they had confidence in their country's parliament and 45 per cent in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but up sharply from 2003 (respectively 17 per cent and 24 per cent).
Ten years ago, economic problems in Latin America shook support for democracy.
If this has held up during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in America have suffered only a brief recession and have benefited from a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty rose only slightly in 2009 and fell again this year to 32 percent.)
However, the mood varies considerably from country to country (see Figure 4).
Brazil’s good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz In<0xC3><0xA1>cio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared sense of progress.
This is more rare in Mexico and Central America where the recession has been more severe and violent crimes have worsened.
It is only the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole have cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see Table 5).
Approximately 31% say that they or one of their relatives have been the victim of a criminal act in the past year; however, this figure is down from 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
A stronger economic performance is reflected in increased support for private enterprise and the market economy: about 71% of respondents in the region say private enterprise is indispensable for development, compared with 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their developed country, up from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support the private company); even though their left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the largest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (up from 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% from last year)
But the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A dirty vote
No one expected a perfect general election in Haiti on November 28.
But it was much worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the country that was hit and in fear.
Ballot boxes and a new ballot were presented, ballots scattered in the gutters, polling stations ransacked and intimidated.
The polling stations opened late at night.
Many Haitians, including many who were displaced in the wake of the January earthquake, wandered in the neighborhood to find where to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged favorites, denounced the fraud and called for the election to be cancelled.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the senior official in Haiti at the United Nations, considers the event "a fairly good election in many ways".
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that they “did not believe that these irregularities, however serious, had necessarily invalidated the process.”
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are indebted to René Préval, outgoing unpopular president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, must announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The second round is scheduled for January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial call for the vote to be declared null and void.
But there may be problems if Mr. Célestin, who has little or no discernible support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second toura reaches the second round.
With a cholera epidemic raging, and more than 1 million earthquake survivors still living in tents, there was fear that participation would be.
In this case, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of the disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 identity cards, needed to vote, were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The stakes are important.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in Haiti’s reconstruction.
And so, it is clear, Haitians do it themselves.
The tip of the feet towards the center
In the weeks after she suddenly became a widow, Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, President of Argentina, enjoyed a wave of public sympathy that improved her approval rating by 20 points, to more than 50%; this is her highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Turning this into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year may depend on Ms Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez’s choice, visibly in mourning, that she would abandon or not abandon the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this regard, the signs remain confused.
Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, used to develop budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend the extra income at will.
Mrs. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez's government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has sunk into disarray following Kirchner's death from a heart attack on 27 October.
Some of the dissident members of the ruling Peronist movement rallied with Ms. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez.
But after chaotic sessions (where one MP slapped one of his peers in the face and others accused the government of corruption), Congress does not have to approve the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to argue,” the president said.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the president even more room to spend at will.
The economy is largely overheating: it is likely to grow by nearly 9% this year.
The official inflation rate now stands at 11.1% but many private estimates and wage demands from unions see this figure close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction a priority, rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to deal with the IMF, harassed the private sector and purged the INDEC, the statistical office, which falsified official inflation statistics.
Can Mrs Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez now moderate these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy was spurred by high world prices of Argentina's agricultural exports.
But inflation eroded the growth boost following a sharp devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Mrs Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez is showing signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial relations with the rest of the world.
This year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused a previous forced debt restructuring for which Argentina had not settled its maturities in 2001.
Now Ms Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez looks to be editing towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could not involve surveillance by the IMF, as is customary.
But last month, Economy Minister Amado Boudou announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index; which looks like a prelude to the remediation of the INDEC.
It is unclear whether Ms Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her term, now that her husband is no longer by her side.
If it does, it needs to gain support from the middle class, among whom Kirchnerism is highly advocated.
When the Argentinians return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have receded.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to quietly repudiate many of her husband’s policies.
A half-hour for China
Taiwanese voters have moved towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother on the other side of the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters ran on November 27, or 70% of eligible people, to elect mayors and municipal councillors in five urban districts, as part of what is considered a general assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a substitute for feelings towards the continent, having forged innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, in the largest reorganization of relations with China proper since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but just right.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party won three of the five mayoralties, it failed to win a majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which leaned toward full independence from Taiwan, won nearly 50% of all votes for the KMT by 45%.
If it had been a presidential election, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's voting share has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with the KMT in the municipal councils.
The event unveiled most of the main topics of the Taiwanese elections, including loud country trucks and mass rally flags with girls dancing in minimal attire.
An attempt at mandatory mysterious assassination was also perpetrated.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, conducted an election tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot the young Mr. Lien, purely through the face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
Strangely, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to harm Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder had an impact on the election by directing suspicion on the DPP and turning voters to the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner in the election was China.
It was striking how much the question of the mainland itself was absent.
Instead, candidates toyed with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China’s military threat.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid paralyzing its ties with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from stoking anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is the answer to a new realization that Chinese companies are indispensable to Taiwan’s economic survival.
Ma, for his part, demanded confirmation as to whether his China policy was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
It is to be expected that the Beijing government will continue to provide trade facilities, in line with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the fold.
China wasted no time sending a negotiator to Taipei to hold a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, it would also like to see political integration; but let’s start from the beginning.
It is better to wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has reinvented itself anyway.
Two years ago, his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on corruption charges.
President from 2000 to 2008, he was a provocateur in favor of explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has emerged under the leadership of Ms. Tsai and the PDP is working hard to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was hailed as a DPP presidential candidate, as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that he too can engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their talks can take place without preconditions.
Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party presents a "trustworthy alternative" to Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a statement released from his cell, he said the PDP candidates would have scored better if they had insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr Su, a pragmatist, not to run for the presidency.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will have a hard time choosing between its potential candidates.
The KMT must make an introspection of itself.
Mr. Ma's assessments were low; despite dizzying economic growth, the KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be largely due to unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A spokesman for the KMT said its cabinet and local offices would be revamped.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan’s support for the rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "the point of no return has already passed."
Grammy Award Nominations: Jazz Singer Esperanza Spalding is a Surprise Selected in the "Best New Artist" Category
Perform at the request of a president, and people are required to take notice of it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer handpicked by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, marked one of this year's Grammy Awards surprises with a major nomination in the category of "Best New Artist."
Considering Spalding is a well-known figure on the jazz scene since his 2008 album, "Esperanza", the nomination remains somewhat mysterious but it is consistent with the Grammy Award rules that an artist must not release more than three albums before recording; which "establishes the public identity of this artist."
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", certainly marked a step forward and, given his slightly engaging vocal style, his skillful hand of pop and funk and his Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one dotted line at Spalding compared to Norah Jones's glittering success in 2003, the closest equivalence to the Grammy Award-winning finalists.
Elsewhere, Grammy Award voters have rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity" in the "instrumental album" category, a ride on an invigorating thrill of a record that was one of last year's top favorites.
Among these Iyer, "Moody 4B" by veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley will be in competition.
Shorty's trumpet, a New Orleans favorite and frequent guest on HBO's "Treme", has been honored in the contemporary jazz category; which also leans strongly towards a certain fusion with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Wild Darcy James Argue's Secret Society, familiar with steampunk, has gained some well-deserved recognition in the big ensemble category; competing with the rich chamber-jazz of Billy Childs Ensemble and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose live byte's "Pathways" album was a fine example of this bassist's democratic hand as a bandleader.
Grammy Award Nomination: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey Lead in Classic Categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards feature a mix of landscapes of musicians and composers from around the world.
Leading the nominations are Michael Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an electric orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a work that was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto by Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also vying for an award.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories covering orchestral, opera, choral and solo recordings.
A category for the classic producer of the year features five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Nominations for the classic album are Bruckner's Symphony No. 3 and No. 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrifice" of the "Chorustratum" and "Deus Ex Machina".
In the opera category, the nominees are "Lulu" by Berg of the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Adolf Hasse of the Ars Lyrica Houston; "L'Amour de Far" by Kaija Saariaho of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Rodion Shchedrin and "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Rodion Maridrin of the Choir.
The composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for contemporary composition count Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of about 30 minutes is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for his solo instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer said he wrote the 15-minute work specifically for mandolin performer Avi Avital, who played the concerto with the Metropolis Ensemble, based in New York.
“I wrote it using sounds from the Middle East and a large number of scales and rhythms from North Africa,” Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the orchestral performance category for conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Instrumental soloists who received nominations include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only nominees vocalist-soloists; here they are: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonov<0xC3><0xA1>, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of classical mixes, soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for her recording "Roots: My Life, My Song"
The Temecula Mosque project won the approval of the planning commission.
A mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often passionate.
Critics attacked the project by claiming that it promoted both terrorism and traffic jams.
But the commissioners ruled Wednesday night that the new religious center complied with local laws and would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people have come to support it: Christians, Jews, Baha'is, you mention it," Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, said Thursday morning.
"I'm proud of that, as an American citizen."
"This shows that justice prevails."
“The opposition is really minimal,” he added.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The session began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people speaking out for or against the center, at roughly equal speaking time, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper’s website.
“There is no more America,” one speaker wrote.
"This is another planet of monkeys with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
Planned Islamic centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including at Ground Zero, the site of the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denounced the violence in the Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of the order of 135 families has co-existed without incident in Riverside County for years but she wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse she rented on a property shared with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque with Mediterranean-style architecture would consist of two minarets and rise to 43 feet high.
It would occupy a site of 4.32 hectares on the Nicolas road about two miles east of the Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal against this project to the city council.
An arsenic-tolerant microbe raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, widens the scope for finding new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This body has a double capacity."
"It can develop either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That's why it's very special, even if it's far from being a really 'foreign' life form," said Paul Davies C. W. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report in Thursday's online edition of the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But researchers have found that the bacterium, discovered in Mono Lake, California, is able to continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"We're wondering what's still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in the search for life beyond Earth because researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not divulge the details of the finding, has generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could divulge the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
That was not the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other planetary environments, organisms may be able to use other elements to actuate biochemistry and that the "standard" set of elements, which we deem absolutely necessary for life, may not be fixed," commented Charles Cockell, a professor at the Institute for Planetary and Spatial Scientific Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell wasn't on the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure," added Cockell.
It was not an accidental discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Institute of Astrology, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, she speculated that a microbe exposed to both substances might be able to substitute for each other.
“Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of phosphorus.”
"As a result, organisms have difficulty distinguishing these elements separately."
“But arsenic is different enough that it doesn’t work exactly like phosphorus; it gets inside and sort of gums the work of our biochemical machine,” Anbar explained.
The researchers collected the bacterium known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing concentrations of arsenic to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a form of life using arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new; but nothing ever showed that it could work.
Arsenic was more common in the early days of Earth's existence, she says; thus, researchers hypothesized that early life forms could have used it.
This suggests that there might be other ways to form life, not just the way life on Earth was formed at first,” said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon’s research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two stolen show dogs were found in Compton.
The other two show dogs out of four stolen from outside a motel in Bellflower have been found, Los Angeles County sheriffs announced Thursday.
The four show dogs — two Welsh akitas and two Pembroke corgis — disappeared Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express pickup truck in which they had spent the night outside a Bellflower 6 motel, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found late Wednesday evening, Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department spokesman Steve Whitmore said.
“The good news is that dogs are doing well,” Whitmore says.
“They are in good shape.”
"They have been returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore declined to say exactly where the dogs had been found, in which neighborhood, and what the circumstances of their discovery were.
"An investigation is underway."
“We don’t want to say it,” Whitmore said.
"We follow orders."
Dog owners Kristina Rickard and David Peek could not be reached for comment Thursday.
They were reunited Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey.
Sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were safe and sound, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis Rickard and Peek had planned to show at regional competitions this week on behalf of Japanese dog owners, were missing until their discovery Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of Long Beach's "AKC/Eukanuba" national championship, where they planned to host Trace.
The other dogs were expected to compete in other events planned in the days leading up to the "AKC/Eukanuba" exhibition, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the couple’s nearly a month-long dog show tour.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van outside, right next to their bedroom window.
They took three other dogs — a Boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier, and a Breton Spaniel — who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the corgis, with thicker fur, in the van where it would be cooler.
They opened the windows a little, so that the dogs could have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the theft of the van at 6 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, equipped with an implanted microchip to identify them.
It is unclear whether a prize was awarded on Thursday.
The lion is ready to blush again, the restructuring of MGM is waiting for the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start all over again.
A New York federal bankruptcy judge on Thursday officially praised the "pre-packed" plan by creditors that would wipe out about $5 billion of the debt; paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and distributing movies and television shows.
With Thursday’s decision that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, no legal obstacles remain before MGM to resurface under the tutelage of Entertainment Spyglass founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the CEOs of what will be a lightened studio.
Staff will be reduced to approximately 320 out of 400 initially.
MGM will not actually emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has concluded a $500 million credit facility to fund MGM’s new operations and productions.
It is currently distributed under license by the investment bank, which is itself worth $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The process of restructuring the studio began in May 2009 when investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to place its finances as it did not have the means to pay interest in the amount of $300 million per year.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and a recovery expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper’s attempts to solve MGM’s financial difficulties and satisfy the studio’s more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed, at the end of 2009, to put the company up for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders, none of whom were willing to pay the additional $2 billion that the creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, everything had to be done again as the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan that, after months of internal disagreements and debates, was finally approved by creditors in late October.
When MGM officially came out of bankruptcy in the following weeks, the Moelis and Cooper companies received multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already secured $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper’s companies, which raised $375,000 per month for their corporate management services, will receive a “success premium” of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to restart production on MGM, which released only one film this year, and put together an annual list of seven or eight films that would be released starting in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on “The Hobbit,” with Warner Bros.
The studio must enter into a separate loan between $265 million and $275 million to fund its share in these two films, which must be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who holds about 18% of MGM’s debt, has attempted to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Tech toys to keep your gift budget in balance
While the top candidate for this year’s most wonderful toy is the IPAD, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft’s video game system, Kinect, both can make a major breach in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes for $99 and that a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 classic beaded jump ropes, or about 48 boxes of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toy vendors – Wal-Mart, Toys “R” Us and BJ’s Wholesale Club – to see the electronic toys I could buy for under $80.
It is clear that Moore's Law has evolved, this year's tech toy is likely to have more strength; while costing the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
Also, while there are generally fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the best known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And button battery toys are on the rise, as well as rechargeable battery toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us unless otherwise noted.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and older) are stuffed toys the size of a guinea pig that sing a note when you squeeze them on the belly.
One pressure is equal to one note, and a second allows you to compose a song.
If you buy several, they will sing in harmony.
Attention: once you start pressing, you can no longer stop.
To combine singing with dancing, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and more) is the best choice.
Inspired by last year’s Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays turn-based games like Simon Says and can do the lunar dance thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheel lock.
The children who tested the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain about a lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It’s back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40 for 3 years and more), with a backpack filled with quiz playing cards designed to turn a car ride into a session with a self-correction and a valve filing cabinet.
If you are suspicious when your child holds your smartphone, here are three standalone alternatives.
The VTech Mobigo ($60, for 3 to 8 year olds) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games do not educate as effectively as the Explorer Leapster ($70, for 3 to 12 year olds), it is the first major revision of the Leapster range, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90, for ages 3-7) uses an iTunes-like system to offer games and e-books and has an SD card input that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for ages 8 and older) is a set of five blocks just larger than a matchbox, each with its own LED display.
The goal is to form words by placing the blocks in line before time runs out, this is ideal for an impromptu spelling contest.
Increasingly, toys have a kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online Penguin Club pet, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for ages 6 to 12) which includes a coin marked with a hidden code.
When you redeem the code online, your child receives enough Club Penguin store credits for two items of choice.
It can be roller skates or a pet toy Puffle.
Slightly larger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and more) is the latest button battery micro-robots.
The fake beast moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone pastes in random directions.
It’s fun to make a maze of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It is also solid.
Ours resisted a fall from the kitchen table and even a momentary passage in the mouth of our dog.
Bringing a softer side to law enforcement in China
Tang Shenbin roamed a town square like an urban sergeant in training by severely inspecting his nervous loads, quietly issuing orders with military authority.
He wanted the female members of chengguan - imposing officials of public order in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and their penchant for violence - to convey some impression to a set of spectators.
"Stand up straight!"
"Be piercing!"
Show them, he said, "what pretty girls look like!"
Four girls who had barely passed their teenage years in white gloves, dressed in identical olive-colored jackets and pants, were freezing at the guard.
Four pairs of black heeled shoes, aligned to the rule.
Four neat hats perfectly perched on top of hair tied by a blue and white striped knot.
"Personally, I think they have an average appearance," Tang said, disdainfully.
"The models are pretty."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China’s urban inspectors.
One city required all new recruits to have a higher education degree.
The Guangdong province has traded the gray-green of uniforms for a supposedly more engaging blue.
In 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had surrounded an uncontrollable snack cart by throwing black eyes, firmly for half an hour, until the peddler packed his belongings and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose to do a large image operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its urban street police of 13 women, specially selected for their appearance, girth and young age.
The idea is to give the undercover police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson may have a hard time catching the eye on China’s underground urban brigade
And for good reason, the critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce municipal ordinances by imposing fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media portray the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors in Hubei province beat an observer to death after he used his cell phone to film them dispersing a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors, stolen and posted online, described how to effectively defeat offenders without emitting blood.
This year in Shanghai, a watermelon peddler was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A video game steeped in violence, available for download online, shows Chinese inspectors trained in assaulting street vendors.
"Chengguan marked the government," China Daily, a national publication, lamented last year after yet another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper called for a "true thorough cleansing."
Skeptics say the approach is a long way off.
After the district made an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News questioned whether women had real jobs or were just tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district's announcement required female candidates, aged 18 to 22, to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five facial features in the right order."
They must be larger than average, 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 21<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches.
Retirement at age 26 is mandatory.
Officers said the work was physically too painful for women over the age of 25.
“It’s their image that’s important,” a certain district officer told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine if they are suitable; it is about the size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes temperament and “inner qualities.”
The women of Chengguan are like flower vases, he said, adding: "In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district management office of the city, does not adhere to this description.
But he noted that height requirements were the standard in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
This is the case of the requirement relating to the order of the facial features.
That it means beautiful is a topic of debate among the Chinese.
Certainly, disabled or disfigured people should not apply.
“We can’t let a beating person or a beetle come and serve here,” Zheng said.
"It wouldn't give a good image."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has apple-shaped cheeks with a finely curved mouth.
She does not consider the enhancement of her appearance to be sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked disillusionedly.
Xu Yang, his 21-year-old dimpled colleague, says, “Our job is to present the image of the city.”
They do not object to their mandate being limited, they said, because they have greater career ambitions than simply chasing salespeople into the alleys where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Every morning, the team confronts a dozen street vendors who move quickly on foot or by bike, trying to sell as many rolls or tofu bowls as possible before fleeing.
"Master Wang, you must go."
“We’ve told you many times already!” said Ms. Xu as a salesman ran away on foot, temporarily abandoning his noodle-cart bike.
Agents describe their functions as more monotonous than arduous.
“It’s pretty much the same thing every day,” said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies post-work marketing.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate property from sellers.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public displays of animosity against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, revolted after false rumors spread that chengguan agents had killed a salesman.
In one night, more than a dozen police and chengguan agents were injured, 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the placid Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered around the corner.
Officers confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as required by regulations.
The owner of the motorcycle was screaming at the scandal.
A 15-minute arm of iron followed before the policemen, with their sinister faces, elbowed their way to their vehicle and left at full speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the men’s team, stayed behind, his white badge turned over to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators - men aged 40 and over - play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a waxy image.
“Sometimes we fight verbally.”
“Sometimes we fight physically,” Li said in a neutral tone.
“Most of the time, it’s the audience that starts.”
Prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign
Attorneys for the Department of Justice have lifted criminal charges against Senator John Ensign, stemming from a case involving an assistant to a former campaign and his efforts to get a lobbying job for the woman's husband, the senator's lawyers said Wednesday.
The decision puts an end to the most serious legal threat faced by Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican candidate for the 2012 presidential election until the scandal surrounding his case made national headlines last year and hurt his career.
Ensign's office said he was "very happy" with the decision, the result of a year-long investigation.
The senator may still be exposed to disciplinary action by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers stated that the Department of Justice had "informed that Senator Ensign was no longer under investigation and that he did not intend to maintain any charges against him in this case."
The Department of Justice has refrained from commenting on this.
The announcement came as a sort of surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who said there was significant evidence that Mr. Ensign conspired to violate a federal criminal lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails and other documents, first reported in the New York Times in October 2009, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, get a lucrative lobbying job to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Ms. Hampton once served as treasurer in an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political donors to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; in accordance with the documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been an associate of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited by law from lobbying his former employer or the Senate as a whole for a year.
Ethics experts have argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, appears to be in contradiction with the so-called ban on the revolving door of lobbying.
According to the evidence that has been made public, “there appears to be prima facie evidence of a conspiracy to violate and substantial violation of the revolving door law,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending clients from a government investigation.
Although the department's judge declined to explain the reasoning that led to the decision in the Ensign case, Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department appeared to be wary of political prosecutions after a number of high-level setbacks received by its Public Integrity Section, including last year's decision to drop the charges against the former senator.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take up arms, said Melanie Sloan, the general manager of citizens for accountability and ethics in Washington, a advocacy group that received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign's senior lawyer, said in an interview that he received a phone call Monday from a prosecutor at the Department of Justice and a follow-up the next day, telling him that the department was not looking for charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign’s team of lawyers had cooperated with prosecutors to try to persuade them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed in a statement Wednesday, “acted in accordance with the law.”
Mr. Coggins declined to clarify the legal arguments he had made to the prosecution.
“I’m not comfortable getting into the details of my discussions with the Department of Justice, except to say that we think they made the right decision,” he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to drop an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, claiming that Mr. Ensign’s parents’ payment of $96,000 to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The election commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a major Nevada corporation that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign’s chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him that he was “hammering” the Home Office on a disputed issue.
Mr. Ensign also attended a luncheon with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and asked the Secretary of Transportation to schedule a meeting on behalf of the airline after engaging Mr. Hampton in lobbying.
When news of the case surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned from his position as fourth-place Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign said two weeks ago that he intends to run for a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped the ethics committee would quickly follow the lead of the Department of Justice and end its investigation.
Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she said.
Cheshire's call will point to Twitter
A half-dozen of them were tapping away in the rows of the courtroom.
They sent every minute horrific testimonial reports via Twitter.
In the end, the defense said there were more than 140,000 messages about the rape case trial and the children tied to their bed in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, is expected to lead to an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed evidence in court that outlines appeal arguments, likely to occupy the courts for years.
What is provocative is that the intense reporting on the trial – as well as the widespread and widespread use by Twitter journalists – have created a “circus atmosphere,” a saturation so widespread and instantaneous with incendiary details that the jury has been misinfluenced by the public’s passions.
The application could prompt appellate judges to debate whether new technologies require new rules in courtrooms.
“I experienced this in this trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in courtrooms is undermining the human rights to a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullmann, a lawyer for Mr. Hayes, Chief Lawyer.
Trial judge Jon C. Bleue of the Superior Court of State laconically rejected the claims in last week’s ruling, saying the media was “carefully controlled” and there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passion.
But this does not seem to be the last word on the issue.
The courts of appeal have recognized for decades that media coverage of notorious cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a 1966 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, arguing in its ruling that there was a “carnival atmosphere at trial” because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers have said that appeals courts seized to review Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later may be curious given the argument that new rules may be needed to manage courtroom communications, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason to be concerned about the impact of new media" in large-scale trials, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily enforced.
Professor Donohue says some appellate judges may be intrigued by the idea that limiting instant communication from courtrooms could allow for fairer trials.
The case of Twitter is just one of many others described by Mr. Hayes’ lawyers, likely to be discussed for years; delaying execution.
Defense lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes was harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them gruesome photos of criminal scenes when selecting the jury.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defense lawyers say they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge unfairly expelled one of the jurors, who had been critical of prosecutors, and that he improperly pressed for a verdict by making the unusual decision to get the jury to deliberate over a weekend.
The jurors were not kidnapped.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the biggest source of interest.
They noted in a challenge to the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and was being discussed during the election campaign by candidates for the governorship and the U.S. Senate.
They maintained that the computer media kept fanning the flames of the emotion of the case.
“The daily shuffling of tweets from the media, cameras and journalists outside the courthouse,” the lawyers wrote, “looked nothing like what had been seen before here in New Haven, and perhaps even nationwide.”
Their focus on the coverage of the Twitter system is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said the claim that instant news was more incendiary than slower releases was a luddist view that would impoverish the Court’s policy governing media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers said the courts of appeal were often drawn to arguments that social and technological change required adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers insist on this claim.
In their case, they make a reference to the 1966 Supreme Court decision that overturned Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the media coverage of the trial and they specified that they would invoke the need for new rules for the new media.
"This affair," they wrote, "represents that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can civility bring divisions closer together?
After a campaign marked by invective and negativity, a minimum of civility erupted in Washington this week.
Is it a harbinger of genuine bipartisan cooperation forward or an illusory moment before the rapid return to partisan struggle in the capital?
Tuesday’s meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders produced no breakthroughs on the big issues that need to be addressed during the “lame duck” session.
But obviously, there has at least been a polite discussion about the differences of the two sides as well as about acknowledging their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each side wanted to score points.
Wednesday’s public meeting of the president’s deficit committee was just as civilized, despite the political differences that remain between members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created mutual respect transcending the ideological divide; but that, however, still divides the members.
This is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
The two sides are now in a period of mutual trial and testing for signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to gauge the limits of public opinion and voters' patience for a renewed partisan war.
That is why Tuesday's meeting and subsequent comments from participants revealed a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and Republicans are too great and too deep to suggest a rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it’s taxation, spending, health care or rights, both sides remain miles away.
Yet the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
“There is no doubt that things have changed on the tone,” said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official, now at the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
“This is inevitable after the election.
The elections arouse partisan passions and then they fade away.
That's good."
On some issues, including those on the agenda of the "lame duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of that.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all of them, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise can be envisaged on the extension of unemployment benefits, if only because Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favour of tax cuts for the rich, while at the same time denying unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, more optimism looms over a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on the "lame duck", with the ratification of the "New START" pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the Lame Duck session will not necessarily lead to a better understanding between the two parties when the 112th Congress meets in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely, if not inevitable.
“Once the things that need to be done are done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations,” he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared skepticism that civility would lead to genuine cooperation.
“I consider most of what’s going on between now and 2012 to be a pre-show or a shadow-boxing compared to the main event of 2012,” he said.
The reasons for this are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters present at the tea that contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to live up to their promises to cut public spending and repeal the new health care law.
These partisan positions are already clear in the early reactions to the deficit committee's recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and raising certain taxes, raising the retirement age and cutting spending.
Co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have chosen one of the toughest tasks in Washington and have, in their own words, imposed the deficit issue on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member committee to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they struggled to reach that number.
The greatest resistance remains among the group's elected officials, suggesting that there are, at least today, few reasons or compromises on tax issues.
Galston foresees two phases in the fighting between the White House and Republicans in Congress.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan clashes, given that Republicans are challenging Obama on budget, taxes and health care; and then followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would be the cause of the change?
The public opinion.
There is ample evidence that, despite the partisan spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see both parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to an impasse, as in 1995, then both parties will closely observe the reaction of the public.
The one who will be judged at a loss will have to change course and find compromises.
But that would still be an optimistic view.
The partisan spirit and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and Congressional Republicans than there was then between President Bill Clinton and Republicans.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a more consequential election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civility exposed this week could be enjoyed by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
Disclosed US documents describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a "Kleptocracy" and passes some of the bribes and protection money it collects to the Kremlin, the U.S. embassy in Russia said in a note in February.
Police and the Federal Security Service are carrying out huge rackets that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy – what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the “vertical of power” – is taking its part as money moves up the ladder.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted Wednesday by Wikileaks on its website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been purged.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow; and he is largely held responsible for corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev but there has been little trace of cleanup since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a leading construction company, have always denied allegations of corruption over the years; and he has won several defamation trials on these charges.
In September, he told a Russian TV channel when asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: “It’s crazy, it’s throwing, it’s anything.”
The Russians believe, by an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt; according to polls.
But it is unusual to find the information stated in an embassy report; and it is unheard of to conceive that it would be to diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link between the Moscow city government and crime has led some people to call it “dysfunctional” and claim that the government functions more like a kleptocracy than a government,” according to the embassy note.
The criminal elements enjoy a “krysha” (a term used in the criminal/mafia world which literally means “roof” or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor’s office, as well as through the entire Moscow city government bureaucracy.
"Analysts identify a three-tiered structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, the MVD and the militias are on the second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
“This is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill a vacuum in some areas where the city does not provide certain services.”
The report states that the FSB is brewing money from the biggest companies and that the police are targeting the small ones.
One source, he said, "explained that business owners in Moscow understood that it was better to get protection from the MVD and the FSB (rather than organized crime groups) because, not only do they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups but they are also protected by law."
“That’s why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer so high.”
The note notes that, although the collection of money is extensive, the protection itself may be unequal; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their affairs closed under one pretext or another.
Medvedev has mentioned the fight against corruption several times but has admitted little progress.
The note from the embassy conveys reports of men bringing suitcases, probably filled with money, to the Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on bureaucrats," said in a recent interview Georgy Satarov, director of Moscow's Indem think tank.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
“It’s not part of a political class because it doesn’t exist in Russia.”
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to the Indem, the costs of corruption across Russia are estimated at more than $300 billion a year.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey of the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are ranked at least to the most corrupt).
The release of the U.S. Embassy note, which was only made yesterday late in the evening, Moscow time, certainly stirs up discontent within the Russian government; although Luzhkov may be blamed, to some extent, for Moscow’s failures, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed by CNN’s Larry King, Putin hypothesized that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fabrication and reacted angrily to the remarks that U.S. diplomats had divulged by calling him Batman and bringing Medvedev closer to Robin.
"The problem is that this is our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
“But to be honest with you, we didn’t suspect that it would be accomplished with such arrogance, such pressure, and, you know, in opposition to ethics.”
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to face the past
In a poorly lit classroom with decrepit concrete walls of poor quality, the headmaster of Anlong Veng High School evoked the man who built it, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves your mok."
“He was a good leader; and he cared about his people,” said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, when he was at the head of the Khmer Rouge, this commander remains popular in this isolated bastion of former Khmer Rouge in northwest Cambodia where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former Khmer Rouge soldiers still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, longstanding loyalty to Anlong Veng is finally being called into question.
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed victims to publicly confront the people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school textbook that, for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian court, jointly headed with the United Nations, handed down its first sentence against a former Khmer Rouge member, condemning, to 35 years in prison, the former head of the infamous torture center in Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as "Duch".
Faced with this development, anxiety has increased among Khmer Rouge veterans in Anlong Veng, complicating reconciliation efforts and their willingness to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
“There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent body that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"The situation generates divisions within families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, illness or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot government in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There, they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last of the movements surrendered in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrillas at their base in the mountains of western Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a sequel to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to defect to the government, culminating in the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had held his head, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without their benefactors, most Khmer Rouge veterans have sunk into the black misery common to rural Cambodia; and many remain nostalgic for the movement.
Although some elite Khmer Rouge officers have kept their positions as local leaders in exchange for laying down arms, they are unqualified, low-grade and file farmers.
"These people have benefited from very little follow-up after capitulation," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are soaked in the agrarian utopian ideology of the regime."
“They were raised in a setting where doing business is a foreign concept.”
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice farmer.
“Life under the Khmer Rouge was good,” he said.
"Your Mok feeds everyone."
But now life is difficult because we have to provide for our own needs.”
The current Khmer Rouge court has also caused concerns here.
The court is expected to begin trial of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, early next year.
The court's mandate is to try senior leaders and key perpetrators of crimes, but it has not said whether it will continue beyond these four cases.
It would take more to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculation has turned to 64-year-old Im Chaem, a former district chief in Banteay Meanchey province under Khmer Rouge rule in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project where thousands of forced laborers were reportedly killed.
Recently, on a hot evening, Im Chaem was returning from work at the field near his wooden house on stilts, on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past within the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she said, she would refuse to go.
“Cambodia is peaceful and stable,” she said.
“If there are more prosecutions, there will be war.”
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected to the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court prosecuted several suspects; although experts and historians dispute this.
“Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past,” he said.
But tackling the past is all Cambodia needs to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang, from the documentation center.
“Reconciliation in Khmer terms is to reconnect the broken pieces,” he said.
"We need to put these pieces together so we can understand."
The center produced the first government-approved manual on the Khmer Rouge, "A History of Democratic Kampuchea, Composed of 75 Pages."
He distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education's history textbooks, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, a 19-year-old student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new handbook helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he came home with the book to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court,” he says.
“They are suspicious because they don’t know exactly how many people the court will prosecute.”
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the manual and the court are starting to make an impact, he said.
Yet the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful appeal here.
In the heights of the Dangrek Mountains, a path, invaded by weeds and dotted with plastic bags, leads up to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty sheet metal roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a roadside cell phone saleswoman, said she didn’t know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a great spirit; and many of the inhabitants go there to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea’s birthday and later that day she planned to march to Pol Pot’s last resting place where she would leave a bouquet of ripe bananas in hopes of bringing luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its stockpile of military grade uranium
The Belarusian government said on Wednesday it would abandon its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a key component of nuclear weapons, as part of a surprise victory in President Obama’s campaign to secure nuclear material around the world.
The agreement was disclosed in a joint statement released after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
The U.S. government had tried for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and appeared to have cleared the horizon last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that some classified operations have been carried out with Belarus over the past two months to remove 187 pounds of military-grade uranium from a Belarusian research center.
This paved the way for an agreement on Wednesday to eliminate the remaining matter of about 500 pounds, according to an official who referred to the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit, organized at the initiative of Obama; where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was profitable to provide an invitation to the former Soviet Republic following the summit in 2012.
“I’m really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
“It proves to me that this process works,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a group promoting nuclear security.
Clinton called the deal "a very significant, important step" by Belarus.
Obama pledged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear material around the world in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said the nation would never give up its uranium.
“We have kept highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military grade uranium and low enriched uranium,” Lukashenko said.
“It’s our product ... We’re not going to make dirty bombs, and we’re not going to sell it to anyone.”
“We’re going to use it for research purposes, that’s all.”
Belarus moved closer to the United States a few months ago; however, by expressing interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to remove uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the equipment had been slightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a facility in Russia to be stored and disposed of, officials said.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by plane, officials said.
The U.S. government has spent $13 million on its efforts, largely to replace Belarus’s research facilities with low-enriched uranium; unsuitable for weapons.
"Thoughtful coordination and organization have been put in place to build trust," leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an energy department official specializing in global threat reduction.
According to estimates by the James Martin Nonproliferation Study Center, Belarus this year had at least 88 pounds of military grade uranium, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus seeks to eliminate its stockpiles by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to Lukashenko's harsh repression of human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggested a potential renewal.
“While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remain essential to improving bilateral relations; and indispensable to the progress of the country and its citizens,” she said.
The government has not objected to CIA flights.
The government has not objected to CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners to Guantanamo through Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the U.S. ambassador in Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the leaked documents (cables) by Wikileaks in the daily El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s, which add that the first vice-president of the Government at that time, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Teresa Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega, had asked that the Spanish Executive be informed in order "to be able to demonstrate that they exercised adequate vigilance on foreign planes crossing Spain".
In June 2006, following a Council of Europe report accusing a dozen countries of complicity in anti-human rights practices, including Spain, a meeting took place between former US Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega.
The vice-president acknowledged that the Council's report "surprised the government of Zapatero out of the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objection to intelligence theft over Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "taken by surprise", reports Aguirre in a cable.
Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos, the incumbent of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at that time, told the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this case the lowest possible profile, even if, as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity for influence".
In January 2007, prosecutor Vicente Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez told the Embassy that he was not going to block the judge’s initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense on CIA flights.
"These reports contain no incriminating elements, no sensitive information," the embassy said after speaking with the prosecutor.
The United States has nevertheless shown its concern for "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" rather than for the declassified information of CNI o of the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to maneuver the case discreetly between governments," Aguirre said.
In March 2007, during a luncheon between the U.S. ambassador and Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, Rubalcaba commented that "even though the Spanish judges are madly jealous of its independence and will do what they deem appropriate", he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid the comments of a rhetorical inflame".
The ambassador also expresses his concern for the PP's action in this case.
“Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take advantage of any indication that the Zapatero government has tolerated or deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the U.S. government,” she said.
The parricide who went to confession complained in a network of the "overwhelming" of being a mother
The girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror <0xC3><0xA0> la galicienne"
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Juanatey Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname she used as a child, she communicated with a cousin and at least one friend; the two originally from Noia, the village of A Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a from which she came.
The messages are from 2008.
To hear them, you need to know his love life, which ABC builds with the help of the testimonies of his parents.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had started a relationship in 1998 with Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n T<0xC3><0xBA><0xC3><0xB1>ez, an industrialist.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Shortly after they separated, we found out she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him have the DNA test.
We discovered another new boyfriend shortly after that.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to survey the labour market, the boy stayed with his partner, who even accompanied her for a week in Palma.
But according to the content of his communications, it is understood that their idyll has fractured, they have separated.
In March 2008 she is in Menorca, alone, and writes: "Alberto is very strange and annoyed by the fact that I came to work there."
“When I told him, it seemed like a good thing to him, but of course he now realizes what it means to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants.”
And then, she talks about a mobile message she just got: "I want you to come home this month or you give me an address to send the child to you."
Ella complains, "If he doesn't like it, let him leave the kid with my mother, and I'll take it when I get home," she alleges.
In May, she talks about the return to her village: "This week I leave, but I will only stay there until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to show up at a workstation so as not to lose it".
She explains that if all was well, she would have taken her elder with her.
“He will stay with the right person, that is, with me, and I will never leave him of my life with another person if that person is not my mother.”
In July, there is another post.
When she taps him, it is assumed that the child, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and was supposedly murdered on the 10th, died.
"Caesar is happy on one side, but he is not happy on the other."
“On the one hand he’s with me and he likes this place a little bit, but on the other hand he goes to school almost every day.”
She talks about a trip to Mallorca.
“He’s going to be there a few hours into the summer and so I’m saving a little money from the babysitter.”
On the 17th, greetings and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you will come."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos in the email, you see, when he wants it, he finds me, shit."
On the 30th, another: "The child is fine, he goes to summer hours to learn Catalan.
On V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor, his current partner, there is one: "He's giving me money."
On the Internet she has posts in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of her own in the MySpace universe, now stuck, where her name was "Muki the Prison Liberator."
"Terror <0xC3><0xA0> la galicienne (epigraphe)".
The last man who lived with her, a vigilante, declares his regret for feeling guilty.
He doesn’t want to think that everything had happened so that she hadn’t told him about the fact that she was a single mother.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica entered the Provincial Penitentiary of Palma yesterday, coming from the center of judicial detainees of Menorca.
The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that she does not remember how the facts happened, "and she did not intend to harm the minor either."
Before, she had confessed to drowning Caesar in the bathtub and depositing his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric trial.
People’s Party members would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and deputies recorded in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the generals because, even if there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this formation gets in these comedies normally doubles that it receives in the Catalans.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610,473 votes in the general elections of 2008, while in the autonomous elections of 2006, they had obtained 316,222.
Last Sunday, the CPP won 384,091 votes.
If we maintain this upward trend, desired by a diversion of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the PP's electorate, the analysts of this formation calculated the fact that, if there were general elections, the PPC could go from 8 to 12 MPs in Congress, while CiU would also win four (it now has 10 more MPs) and PSC would not win any more MPs.
These calculations would find that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, ERC would lose one member - it now has three - while ICV would keep one member or win one.
But if the electoral agenda is maintained, the next meeting would take place in May 2011 for municipal committees, where the popular can also be decisive at the end of socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relay at the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manipulates the highest budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both the nationalists and the popular agree that PSC could lose the mayors of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lleida and Gerona, where the socialists would not get the majority nor the possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the Republican debacle, it would not be fanciful that this formation loses its representation in the city hall of Barcelona - it is necessary to get 5% of the votes-.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lleida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they may be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lleida, the PP recorded only a difference of 500 votes compared to PSC, whose mayor, <0xC3><0x80>ngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met several times.
Popular people have also made progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Now the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
Catalan cell facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
Apart from the seven detainees in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian detained by agents of the General Information Commissariat of the Police of Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, led from Thailand, facilitated passports to different Al Qaeda groups, among which "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Land Tamil" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Letter) were the last to cause the bombing.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with "Operation Kampai" has "been weakened" the apparatus of falsification of Al Qaeda at the international level and "therefore, its operational capacity".
Investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, may have sent thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were falsified and then distributed to groups that were part of the criminal Al Qaeda galaxy so that its “combatants” could cross the borders of Europe and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network was operating in Europe, which is why in the investigations participated, apart from the Thai services, other European police units, which is why in the territory of the European Union there could be the following days similar blows to the one recorded last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the arrest of the Pakistanis Junajkan Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), another was held in Thailand, with the capture of the Pakistanis At Butthana and At Muhammad.
They were the ones who headed from Bangkok the cell located in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - some of which was hit in 2009 - mainly stole tourists' passports that met the conditions of the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents had to be in the name of young men between 25 and 45 years old, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
Investigators point out that so far no details have been found that connect the detainees in Catalonia to the Bombay bombing, even though the perpetrator of the attack, Laskar e Taiba, was one of the receiving groups of passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be recalled that a few days before this attack was committed, a few miles of dollars were sent through a transfer agency from Catalonia that were "invested" to buy mobile cards that were used later by the members of the "commando" that killed 106 people.
The police have taken possession of a wealth of documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
The leader of PPC, Alicia S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions to support his inauguration as president of the Generalitat, identical to those exposed during the campaign and which are reduced to giving priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-sovereignist adventures as is the economic complicity that the leader desires.
The president of the Catalan popular came to the meeting with Artur Mas with the security that gives the fact of having obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to be loved, because the CiU candidate requires that at least one of the formations that the opposition will exercise abstain in the vote of the nomination.
Of a possible agreement with the PP depend the future alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in the Congress during the general elections, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of the political leaders are in Catalan key.
And as for the president of the PP, to support an inauguration "it would be necessary to eliminate all sovereignist and independenceist discourses", and the economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader wants to submit even to the referendum.
The two leaders have in common their gamble to weaken the political apparatus of a very exaggerated autonomous administration and eliminate the tax applied to inheritances and donations.
Details of the negotiation on the inauguration of Mas will be dealt with by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who has promised a tough opposition - Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s (ERC), Albert Rivera (Citizens) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatrics claim that the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the center of Olot do not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
The heads of the geriatric La Caritat d'Olot (Girona) yesterday held a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people for whom he was responsible in the interval he worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, presented himself accompanied by the lawyer of the center, Joan Ca<0xC3><0xB1>ada and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to exercise the accusation against the responsible" for the dead but "legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials".
And apart from the social discredit that the entity may suffer for failing to detect the night nurse’s criminal activities in time, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of a large compensation that the legal representatives of the victims’ parents are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates from August 2009 and that from that day onwards he did not stop killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - whom he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality took place by phone.
Caritat, through its director, categorically denied yesterday this situation and mentioned that "the lack of measures may not have been at any time the cause of what happened".
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in this case there is only a hint of recklessness on the part of any other person than the accused".
The person already baptized as the “Angel of Death” confessed 11 murders yesterday and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case he caused her death by injecting her with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he committed with a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat mentioned the fact that it is complicated to control the access of the center's staff to medicine.
Insulin injections and the cocktail of sedatives had been the mechanism employed in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his desire to relieve the suffering of the inmates, used to kill them.
But laboratory analyses will clarify whether Vila does not lie by saying that he sought for his first victims a less cruel death or on the contrary he burned them inside by giving them laundry as he has already confessed that he did with the three women he killed between October 12-17.
Caritat does not believe the statements of the night nurse, nor the number of murders confessed, they do not eliminate the possibility that the number will be greater and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in changing the way to kill after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they declare that they will remain at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
The ECB threatens
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to Trichet’s threat yesterday that “markets should not underestimate our ability to react.”
Peripheral differentials have been forcibly closed and European banks’ shares have suffered more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we must not underestimate the ECB’s ability to be wrong, and the euro has barely seen an increase, which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that, in the same way that it collapses, recovers, but motivated by short and highly speculative position closures.
The institutional investor will be slow to lose fear.
A month ago, ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank demanded the finalization of the public debt purchase plan because of its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures in the future and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis, we hope to extend the current liquidity measures "at least until March" and maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We hope that the bond-buying program will continue and that the signal will even be intensified.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue blinded to withdraw the liquidity measures, God help us!
Just as during their May meeting in which they claimed they had not even considered buying bonds and they collapsed markets, history could repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka on Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse in the market.
Yesterday the one-year auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only $500 million at 5.28% compared to $750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the guys in Portugal dropped 30 basis points across the curve, and clearly reflecting a shift in market sentiment after Trichet’s words.
In Ireland, figures for the Allied and Bank of Ireland holes have been published.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million in the short term and 15,000 potentials and they have until February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumed in the Assistance Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
Nevertheless, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and it does not yet have sufficient support, therefore Ireland remains in a foci of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to ease tension ahead of the upcoming Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest of the hymn of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the president had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound to investors like the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish Stock Exchange suffered 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike in February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain was rapid and radical, and we benefited from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, therefore we hope that it resolves itself with high demand and helps dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to request a Plan of Assistance would be self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we don't need, the Treasury has more than $40,000 million in liquidity available, triple that of March, to very expensive types and they cut off access to markets sine die.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar’s wife, “apart from being, appearing to be.”
Courage, we can get out of it!
The president of Eulen will challenge the council of Vega Sicilia requested by his sons
The storm does not stop in the open conflict within the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, founder of the group, will challenge, as he considers it "null of law", the judicial council of El Enebro next 16, requested by five of his seven sons in which they will try to assert their majority and take over the management bodies of the firm holding Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his sons Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s David and Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a José grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for control on the part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding company of business services for companies does not appear to be willing to give in in his litigation to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
From its board of directors he was excluded by five of its seven sons who appointed themselves directors in the meeting of shareholders of January 18 this year whose dispute is registered in the Register of Commerce and Companies.
The judicial council of El Enebro for the next 16, convened by the Commercial Magistrate No. 2 of Madrid, has again opened the box of thunder within the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family.
The recourse to the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convocation of the assembly.
The latest move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquiriz is described by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as a "desperate recourse of the plaintiffs his five sons to try, through a procedural argument, by clearly defrauding the Law and abusing the right, to validate and correct the radically null assembly on January 18", according to his official spokespersons.
This argument will be the basis for, once the assembly takes place, to be challenged considering that it is "null and void of right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully that the magistrate convenes an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a heritage company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez’s sons control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the services group nevertheless requests the usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to familiar protocols.
This case is the substantive issue that the judge must decide after the hearing on the application for challenge for which there is not yet a reported date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with Siemens secret weapon
Software creates improvements on cars in real time.
As soon as Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select world of speed was marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into account the options of a new team that had just arrived, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the last phase of the championship they all bet on the triumph of Ferrari Fernando Alonso.
Without lowering the skill as a driver of the champion, the German Sebastien Vette, nor the ability of the Renault engine that powers his car, in the world of Formula 1 we talk about the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to transform it into a winning team.
In reality, it is a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with objectives far removed from the high car competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer instrument has been used to create assembly lines for manufacturing plants around the world, power stations, high-precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding defects and avoidable costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial division, explains that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 plant has allowed Red Bull to create and execute "in a few hours, almost in real time", the changes, changes and improvements detected during the races and tests.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 stables had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four vehicle improvements each season.
The Red Bull team now employs 180 highly qualified young professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all sorts of modifications on the cars.
The Siemens executive explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull's vehicles except the engine, which is the sole responsibility of Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can move from virtual reality simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limitation to this technological development madness is the $40 million each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech plant to create and produce its cars in a locality 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that happens there is considered top secret.
There are 580 people on duty, including two drivers, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
Red Bull’s Formula One hero, no doubt, is recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the energy drink brand has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and the notoriety is zero.
The plant’s chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it could be said that R&D advances in the case of race cars brought 50% of the wins and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology accounts for 85% of the success, while drivers bring 15% of the added value.
Nevey admits that the Vettels or Webbers will never be replaced by computers, because "they are unpredictable gladiators."
HP to set up clean stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) has opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
It will be the first of the network of 20 stores between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will account for this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP Spain Vice President Helena Herrero gave as an example the refurbished shop located on the Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which she has been working for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to establish 200 branded outlets in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first ones opened were those in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, the one in Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, although she admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HM Personal Systems assured that the philosophy for the establishment of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and takes care of the design of exclusive store furniture (with products that can be touched in an interactive way), which in Europe will hold an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of facility staff.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of shops claims to "improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in purchase, assistance, after-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a world-leading pilot program that solves possible problems with HP’s computer equipment as a guarantee.
An online service connects with a technical center located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
“So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days.”
"This system is designed specifically for MPEs and users, as large companies have already contracted technical support services," noted Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell to ‘steal’ 1 million customers from rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, Banco Sabadell CEO Jaime Guardiola thinks 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
Despite this, it foresees a collapse of interest margins, which will be tried to compensate partially with increases in commissions and the price of credit.
Sabadell expects to capture a million private customers in three years, its task to be accomplished.
Sabadell has found a way to operate over the next three years and survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch in 2011 a new master plan that will maintain a three-year stability.
The objective, apart from surviving without the need to resort to public subsidies from FROB, is to gain market share by attracting one million new private customers - 700,000 if we deduct those who can leave the bank -, its great task to be accomplished, because until now this bank had spoiled SMEs and companies more than the private client.
This year it has attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share for individuals is 3.5%, while for companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the bet on productivity, or what is the same thing, of austerity, with cost reduction as the objective, the provocations of which will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the year.
Few banks now dare to set targets and make them public, because the financial crisis has disrupted all the plans of the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalize this year its Optima master plan, established four years ago, although initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation determined its extension for one more fiscal year.
Customers who miss savings banks will be its main focus.
During a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental year".
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
Moreover, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental for the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And even if he thinks that the war of liabilities - which penalizes margins - is shrinking, the price of risk premiums that banks and credit unions pay for its issues to obtain liquidity is already shifting to the price of credit to compensate for the fall in margins.
“The liquidity and financing aspect is structural and will be a pressure factor on credit.”
“We haven’t tightened the tap, but the differentials are higher,” Guardiola said.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of differentials - see CincoD<0xC3><0xAD>as of 22 and 27 November.
He also admitted that the trend of the banking sector now "is to increase commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell's management plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "larger dimensions will be requested."
“Everything will move next year,” he said.
He says the capital needs are “growing enormously” and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And he mentions that the FROB can replace the market in fundraising in the case of new recapitalizations.
Having ensured that Sabadell can survive the temporary closing of markets, it has diminished the importance of the fact that some banks are already predicting it as a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that it cannot be issued, but contrary to what happened in June, short-term funding can be obtained through rest, which mitigates the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers between credit unions
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a new wave of savings bank mergers and reiterated the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When the process of concentrating Spanish savings banks began, there were several entities that assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would reserve themselves for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (ECSC), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of the production of this new wave of operations.
"I think that most of the mergers have been made, we cannot say that the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca C<0xC3><0xAD>vica group is a second phase, these are adjustments."
"Most of it has been fully realized; it is possible that instead of 17 we will go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes have already been carried out under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in this operation too," he said.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Arag<0xC3><0xB3>n (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the process of concentration takes place "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way it takes place within the timeframes that have been set in the past, not now, in the business plans with the Bank of Spain", he said.
“The move from 45 caisses with an average of 28,500 million assets volume to 17 with 75,500 million is a trial unparalleled in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to be compliant with Basel,” he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a series of rather unhappy opinions about the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of serosity and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain does is to remind that we must respect the deadline before the end of the year".
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world and attributed to people who question it a "lack of knowledge".
The leader mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can remain very calm" with the situation of financial entities and savings banks, a system that has started a process of concentration "very important" and "going at the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector did well in the stress tests that the ECB carried out in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin opted to stay in the euro, but it set the conditions for the whole Union.
Market tensions have provoked a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero announced new methods of adjustment, which vary from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private investment agencies or abolition of the 426 euros of aid to the unemployed without professional contribution to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, joins Chancellor Angela Merkel’s criticism of her responsibility to detach the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be mentioned that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction of the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which clashes with that of maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, in Germany we are beginning to speculate on the three possible exits from the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the Mark, although now it seems like science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, almost 50% of the population.
The third, a new conception of the euro, in line with German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, fiscal rigor, fines for countries that transgress them, possible suspensions of payments of one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has long been defined, so now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were boosting deficits, the German government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany thought needed to be done (fiscal rigor and fiscal stability plans) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second blow of the Central European country was when Merkel hardly prolonged the decision to save Greece.
From that moment it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public and published opinion were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel again expresses a clear position, calling for the reform of the EU treaties to make possible the rescue of a country and at the same time oblige private lenders to bear a share of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although somewhat softened, was approved and, in the following months, we should witness the process of reform of the Union that will make these measures possible from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not think it will cross.
And she tells us all that, even if now we have to take measures with which we may not agree too much, from that date onwards the old functioning of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which countries that break the rules will be severely punished, they may be forced to declare themselves in default and, in that case, the private sector will also bear a share of the costs.
Germany warns us that we must follow a severe path of growth with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge gaps in the balance of payments, like the one that presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
The bet is clear.
And it would be wrong not to hear it.
It is not just about reducing the government deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we're being asked to do is much harder.
And what he absolutely must not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will bring us greater tranquility.
And that we can seize the opportunity that we have been given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero also heard it this way and his double declaration (the reforms promised after the meeting last Saturday with big companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite Merkel's criticisms, the path has been paved for the thesis that it is necessary to put order at home.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they don't seem to move it.
And among the possibilities envisaged, it is not possible to exclude that of abandoning a monetary zone too full of insignificant countries.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that it had warned us.
Sport and fraud of the law
The tricks similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate ingenuity but not the will to escape a sanction.
The expulsion in principle by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the November 23 match against Ajax in the Champions League has caused a lot of ink on the anti-sports character of such behavior and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before finishing the game (which their team was already clearly winning), both players deliberately lost time when they made mistakes in determining the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and given that Real Madrid will eventually be the leader of its group, both players will complete the regulatory sanction during the next match of the barrage match against Auxerre and will be able to move without cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA discipline committee sanctioned the team's coach, José Mourinho, with two matches and different economic sums to the players involved.
Provoking a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, the unwritten but followed rules of this sport.
Part of the debate that emerged in the related case is due to the fact that this had as protagonist a team of the entity of Real Madrid (who in his anthem displays the nobility and honor and who on past occasions has condemned to a fine to his players for similar acts) and to the dramatization orchestrated, it seems, by Mourinho, who adds a more hila.
In any case, the debate asks whether this type of behaviour is not expressly prohibited by the regulation and contradicts the principles of sport, that is to say, whether these actions commit legal fraud, because they are actions that respect the sporting regulation, but seem to evade its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of harm they cause to the sporting spirit.
One of the assets that includes the sporting spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions has not been endangered, that is, there has been no violent play.
Another of these assets that is alluded to with the correct game is to prevent the team of offending players from unfairly profiting from the opposing team, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of Real Madrid players is that it does not accommodate what is normally characterized as cheating or fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules was not carried out in secret to try to avoid the sanction, but their action precisely tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the penalty of the referee.
They waited and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another issue is the type of benefit that offenders obtain from the intentional faults examined.
Here it seems necessary to observe that one does not put in a situation of disadvantage to the rival and one does not get an advantage in the same match either, because obviously the result of the action assumes the fact of leaving their own team with fewer players.
And it’s not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club couldn’t count on these players.
Obviously the advantage lies in the fact that the players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with some degree of indeterminacy, because the team could be eliminated suddenly and apart from that, with this action the players complete a penalty game and move on to the second round of cards, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cards occurs with one less than in the first round.
So, climbing the ladder, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions are not contrary to the sporting spirit, which nevertheless includes making strategic decisions that promote the maximum benefit of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not act to avoid the application of the sanction (it would indeed be a clear case of fraud of the law), otherwise they chose instead the moment in which they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without evading the penalty or running away from it.
Even though the line between genius and fraud of the law is widespread, on this occasion I think we had a clear case of genius.
The controversy, it seems to me, arises because of two factors: because there have been two self-expulsions and because of the way of transmitting the director to provoke them.
The evil caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not so much ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive offers to capture Christmas dinners for groups in BCN
The calendar dictatorship is concentrating this year an avalanche of reservations for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-funded celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the touron and the lottery, when December arrives also come back the dinners of groups before Christmas that continue to be the oxygen balloon for restaurants and entertainment in Barcelona, but that because of the crisis have resulted in an offensive price adjusted to be able to capture the majority customer: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, coincide of business and coincide with business.
To complete the complication of accounting, this year's calendar (as New Year's Eve falls Friday) concentrated requests in the week of December 13, resulting so far in an avalanche of dinner reservations for the peak days (the 17th and 17th) and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated group dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many employees organize them by paying out of their own pockets.
Whatever the situation, they are all asking for battle prizes, confirms the president of the Restoration Guild of Barcelona, Gaiet<0xC3><0xA0> Farr<0xC3><0xA0>s.
The employer's representative, now, does not dare to predict what the holidays will be like this month.
"People think a lot before booking."
“They want to go out but they pay a lot of attention to prices,” he says.
The deal will go well "for those who give quality at a good price and with good service", he adds, and recalls that customers tend to go down a step with the crisis, so that the slice around 25 euros has become the majority in demand.
In a survey of various establishments in the centre, there was a collapse of requests for the night of the 17th.
The Soteras group indicates that there is an authentic boom of requests for that Friday, with the claim of spending less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the situation, with complete formulas from 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has meant more early bookings, even from the beginning of November.
"We have done our best to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros," they detail.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 premises, remains optimistic after detecting a surge in billing since the second half and good, albeit concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group mention that the 18th will also be a hyper-active day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate the holidays in advance.
To their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year instead of demanding more details, such as Catalan wine made according to the Champagne method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies again inviting their employees and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased a little.
On the part of the patronage Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment of Barcelona), its vice-president, Enric Gom<0xC3><0xA0>, trusts in the possibility of starting to see the end of the tunnel and argues that overall reservations are "animated", even if customers "negotiate to the maximum".
This is true, the hope for the festivities has not declined, regardless of who pays, he says.
Pakistan’s nuclear program raises serious concerns in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at a “faster rate than any other country.”
The WikiLeaks leaks confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department filtered through the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns that the Pakistani nuclear program causes in Washington.
Aside from the enlightening and tasty details they offer about the content of the conversations and thoughts of US diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, instead of increasing, "decreases" and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country."
The peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program – the fact that weapons are not assembled, but are stored in components to make it difficult to destroy them in the event of an attack – is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
This is how the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists in a report before the visit of the former National Security Advisor, James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear facilities in the territory under attack by the Taliban, the dispersion of nuclear materials whose noise is short and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials".
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is envisaged, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to maintain guard.
“Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the drop in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs,” Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev said during a meeting with his U.S. counterparts.
The new documentation filtered through Julian Assange’s portal is the ever-decreasing cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and Pakistan’s high degree of nuclear weapons production.
An embassy dispatch in May, which described communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", supported the following: "Transparency is frequently non-existent; aid offers remain unanswered or are eliminated".
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a National Intelligence official for South Asia, noted that “despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world.”
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit by the head of the army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it "very clear" to the official that "the Pakistan Army must end the tacit support to terrorist groups".
On the hunt for the WikiLeaks leader
Obama will appoint a senior anti-terrorist official to prevent further infiltration.
Interpol issues a red alert to track movements and locate Assange.
All the aspects related to WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated maze where it is difficult to have a certainty about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "locate and track the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
In addition, this one is not new, otherwise it is dated November 20.
And this one has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter million U.S. diplomatic documents but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
WikiLeaks’ lawyer Mark Stephens said: “The police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.
The 20 international police force based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it did not make it public until yesterday, after receiving the authorization of the authorities of that country.
The 188 countries of Interpol have been instructed to identify or locate Assange “to obtain his provisional arrest and extradition.”
Even though Interpol cannot give the order to arrest an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization's explanations, consider the red notice appeal a clear path for arrest -- which the national police force must carry out -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England.
The movement outraged Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder's willingness to answer questions from Swedish authorities via videoconference.
They also recall that Assange sought and obtained the permit to leave Sweden from the prosecutor in his case, which is compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's head of security.
"This seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution," the letter said.
While the world is looking for him - and in Australia his mother defends her son's innocence - Assange continues to find himself in an unknown place, but he is not silent.
On Monday he gave an indeterminate interview to the editor of Time magazine via Skype, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If it can be shown that she was responsible for giving orders to American graduates who are spying on the UN in violation of international treaties that the United States has signed, she should resign,” he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request “ridiculous and absurd.”
“I’m not at all sure why the opinion of a guy with a web page should interest us,” he told CNN.
Obama himself has tasked a senior counterterrorism official, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama’s attempt to reduce Assange’s importance contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators are proclaiming these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will be chairing the National Security Committee in the Lower House in January, has asked the State Department to consider including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations “to confiscate its funds and prosecute anyone who provides them with contributions or assistance.”
Even further has gone Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who has had to come back on his statements after saying that Assange will have to “be murdered.”
“Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something similar.”
One person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and a potential presidential candidate.
“The one in the government who leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything that is not an execution would be too kind a punishment,” he told Fox.
Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seeks peace in ERC with nods to Carod's followers
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposed a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seems to have found the recipe for resolving yet another internal revolt inside ERC, with no north due to the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The party president is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for the followers of former leader Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as its liar and that it can absolutely not give him headaches that he had with other extinct currents.
That is why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new critics with winks that allow him to armor himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s announced yesterday that more than 200 ERC national advisers will be able to vote on its continuity in secret.
By ballots, not by raising your hand.
If the carodists want to convey a certain vote of penalization to the president, they will be able to do so without any fear of reprisals.
In fact, the leader of the ranks wants to avoid the image of division and submission to his person.
In several interviews he stated that he would not consider himself ratified with half plus one of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a "Bulgarian" result would not be good either.
People close to Carod demand from the president a little more than making his position available to the militancy, a gesture that is not worthwhile when Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s controls the maximum organ between congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a roadmap until May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that management will submit to the vote of the National Council on the 18th.
His intention is to support Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s in exchange for the promise of the latter to schedule the congress for the fall of 2011, which the leaders consider a sure fact.
The ERC leader confessed that "polyphony" affects stability and that his goal is to make the organization once and for all able to wash its laundry room with the family.
In this line, the article that the current advisor Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologue of Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s, the holder of Innovaci<0xC3><0xB3> thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" is as if it had been done.
And he listed five of them, of which he points out two.
The first, "recompose" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the militancy, that is, include new figures that come from the sector adept of Carod.
The second can be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquid once and for all the assembly as an operating mechanism.
Thus, he defends a reform of the statutes that allows the realization of congresses through delegates elected by suffrage.
Finishing with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession of the Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s team, which has already struggled in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the convulsive conclave of 2008 commissioned the leadership to revise the assembly model at a specific statute reform congress.
This meeting remains unfinished, as the internal tide of recent years did not recommend addressing this issue.
Now, without critical sectors on the lookout, the time might be right to take it back and close it forever.
23 executed in November; 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO of the State of Mexico, there was a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were executed in the state of Mexico, four fewer than in the previous month according to the Mexican state of Milenio.
Among the murders are those of three women and the discovery of two bodies cut in Valle de México.
During the penultimate month of the year there were 390 deaths in theory related to organized crime.
Among the cases we mention that of a corpse found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitl<0xC3><0xA1>n, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three shots fired and the blow of grace to the head, apart from the feet and hands tied with a cable.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the trunk of an abandoned vehicle on Mixtecas Street in Colonia Santa Cruz Acatl<0xC3><0xA1>n, Naucalpan.
Very early Thursday morning, the four, the owners of jointly exploited land found a body with signs of torture and at least three fatal shots in the chest, on the highway near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the area that crosses the municipality Villa Guerrero.
Near the body was found a message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later in Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yotl, a 50-year-old man was murdered with eight gunshots as he left his house to start garbage collection work.
On November 7, two 30-year-olds were killed by a headshot each in the settlement of San Pedro Xaloxtoc, municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the bonfire in the forehead, the body of a man was found on a lonely road from Colonia El Naranjo and under the body was found a 25-caliber gun-shot bullet.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water channel of the Plaza Golondrina colony.
The emergency corps conducted a thorough search of the rest of the body members, but they were not found.
Residents of Tepotzotl<0xC3><0xA1>n were alerted to the discovery of a corpse in Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Colorada, with the hands tied behind and the eyes blindfolded.
The man had a gunshot wound to his neck.
In the middle of the month, the execution of two men who had been wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the municipality of Atizap<0xC3><0xA1>n de Zaragoza was reported, two death warning messages were discovered at the same time with the victims.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes settlement in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony, the rest of the body was wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by The Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found in the hamlet of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the next morning the body of a man in Huixquilucan was located that had been wrapped in a yellow and blue blanket, being in principle identified with the name Mario R<0xC3><0xAD>os, according to a message that his executors had left beside him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots in the neck, the lifeless body of a woman was found in the hamlet of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the skin of the woman were detected tattoos of Santa Muerte and necklaces with his image.
Towards the end of the month, the body of a man was found on the edge of a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three bullets and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with their heads twisted and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said: "This is what happens with those who do not align".
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and tied hands and feet, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the San Agust<0xC3><0xAD>n Colony Justice Center.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yotl.
The first of them had been beheaded in the Cuchilla Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n settlement and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with a cinnamon ribbon and a message next to it; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez.
Near him, officers found a bristol with a message.
China maintains targets to reduce greenhouse gases
The representative of that country at COP16 assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and detailed that it maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions between 40 and 45 percent until 2020.
China is maintaining its offer to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, China’s representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and convert its industry.
In fact, he said, his country has invested $245 million over the past four years in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Nonetheless, he made it clear that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community in this area.
He mentioned that China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity-building; institution-building; and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all of these areas, including last year's approval of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the objectives addressed in terms of reducing greenhouse gases, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have worked in a coordinated manner with governments and local authorities to achieve energy savings, efficient energy use and emission reduction targets.
In addition, he said, there are various multi-year plans underway or completed, both funded by the Chinese government and by the governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned, the Energy Efficient Utilization Program, which has been implemented over the past five years and which has received investments from the United Nations (UN), the government and the private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for the change of incandescent lamps by low-cost lamps and another for mitigation and adaptation, he detailed.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the government’s scientific advisor on climate change, assured that China’s efforts have been greater than one thinks.
For example, he explained, the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is three tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution in contamination.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% in the last five years and plans to make another similar by 2020, he said.
Legal expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of PAN has detailed that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what of right.
The national leader of PAN, César Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was legal and that the former Panic leader has the right to address the Commission of National Order to claim that right.
In the interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo's protest as governor of the state, he said that in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision adopted at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Commission of Order."
"Mr. Espino has the right to address, if necessary, by making a complaint to the Commission of Order of the National Council, so that this is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he enlightened that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance on the negotiating table for the presidential candidacy.
Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez said he was convinced that Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional would be stronger after the internal elections on 4 and 5 December, in which a successor should be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the time being, it was an approach to local elections that was successful and achieved its goal," he said.
The Panist leader mentioned that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, "we savor it and make us stronger," he said.
He said that probably the council will know how to elect the best leader that Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional needs for the next three years, so he would give the reliever "to the person determined by the council."
“I’m completely quiet and open, I’d be proud to leave the office of party president to any of the five.”
He predicted that the revival recorded by the party in the elections last July 4 will be reflected on the next dispute, even if "it is not yet the time to think about 2012."
"At the moment it is a question of accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emanate from the alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so we have made "many hopes as far as they are concerned, and I am sure that Gabino will live up to expectations".
When asked about PRI’s criticism of President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n because of his speech during his four years in office, César Nava asked PRIists to reflect on the six years of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas were better than those of Fox y Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n; let them start defending them; let them come out of 'the closet,'" he said.
He said that the holder of the Federal Executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because in the country there is no gag, let alone censorship.
Obama promotes law on Twitter for undocumented students
“If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation,” Trump tweeted.
President Barack Obama met today at the national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal Twitter account.
“If you agree with the passage of the Dream Act, call the senators and ask them to approve the legislation,” Obama tweeted.
His short message keeps open a cybernetic link to a larger document that asks the public to contact senators immediately, as the vote on legislation is imminent.
“With a vote we hope for soon, now is the time to listen to your voice,” he said.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation if the extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding continue.
Such a block, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other bills such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other bills, Presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he is confident that once the tax issue is resolved we will be able to set an agenda for the rest of the bills.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
“We all agree that this tax issue needs to be resolved before the end of the year.”
“I think we can get an agreement at some point in that direction and then we can plan the sequence of the rest,” he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would ask for a "debate closing vote" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on in the Senate starting next Thursday, even if the most likely would be next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize 800,000 young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, remained in that country for the last five years and were accepted by an institution of higher education or by the Army.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the bill, which is why they require the help of a large number of Republicans, at times when the pro-project organizations are heavily lobbying to ensure approval of the bill.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
Nevertheless, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only one Republican expressed support for the bill, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why supporters of the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the term on Senator Mel Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch, of Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, of Texas, but they said they would not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his posture so far.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the biggest obstacles to the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With literature we put our finger on the wound
The second stage of the Pleasures of Language was a walk in which the participants showcased the narration
"Sex in the language, I understand it, but... the finger on the wound? what do you expect from me?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the Pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and this time used the subtitle of her question (during another fair the round table was dedicated to Sex in Spanish).
The finger on the wound "... puts us in embarrassment", gently launched the Argentine writer to the public, most of the young people, who had gathered at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and in which Valenzuela, Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez, Mayra Montero and Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz later defined as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who seeks to know what the "wound" is, she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectiologist she comes out convinced: "Patience is not my strength, it may be my wound".
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who took his breath away in the middle of the hallway, but who explains to him that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is what is open in reality, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded: "On the wound I have only been able to know that it is open in reality and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must be very connected with each other.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez also presented a delightful narration which he called Praise for Invention, where the finger on the wound is not named but at some point is discovered.
With touches of magical realism, he speaks of a famous sorceress who touched clouds, turned back people who had gone far or repaired virtues that a young lady had lost, a narrative that turns to speak later America, the great news that had from the beginning his own chroniclers and quotes Bernal D<0xC3><0xAD>az del Castillo who criticized the excesses of the narratives capita.
Cervantes who invented us all made fun of the false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but in some way we would never have told the history of America with an imagination that even lacked modesty.
Nevertheless, he stressed, "the fools and the liars have the best imagination" and here the reality converges with the lie, we no longer know which part of the narrative belongs to one band or another, where fiction literature reaches its peak.
This is known as the ‘tradition of Cervantes’.
“It’s because of his legacy that you’re what you’re telling.”
In turn, writer Mayra Montyero annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations provoked by the ILF's invitation with its Le due sur la plage round table.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican has put her hand on the great wound of social violence that her country is going through - and Latin America shares - produces disputes over the trafficking and sale of drugs.
"I think that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that is of course not premeditated," she said, after quoting that the reality of literature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between the author and the readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Montero who also stressed "it must on the wound of the committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives at a high speed also with regard to intellectual habits and the control of consciences that turns to the advantage of dogmatisms, "behind every affirmation there is a little no and behind every denial there is a little yes".
“To be masters of our own feelings and masters of reality, we have to nuance: and nuance means many times putting a finger on the wound and disturbing people who feel very comfortable thinking in caricature, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuance and disturbing also the powers that prefer a world in black and white,” he said.
Romano on the hunt for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has had three losses in finals he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has managed to reach three times the decisive series.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are also two different styles that confront each other, marked by their technicians, who find a contrast between them marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has had three losses in finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has managed to reach three times the decisive series, even if so far he has not put in the mile and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentinian ended up comforting himself with the runner-up medal, he stayed one step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The Santanista strategist reached his first final as a coach in the 2002 Opening Tournament, when he held the reins of Morelia with which he lost with an overall result of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the 2003 Closing he also reached the decisive duel and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and that was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered a setback again, as his team made an equal match 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty shootout he got a 3-1 lead with two chances to get the title and finally three of his players missed by 11 meters and he hit the 4th.
Rubén has lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his rival in the tournament, therefore he does not want to have the same fate, he tries to detach himself from the evil to be able to celebrate for the first time a title, even if he claims that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, not for a passion I have and therefore I will get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," the helmsman commented when asked what his weaknesses would be in the finals.
He remembers a lot of the last final, of which he assures that he has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can remember is that until the referee whistles the final, we can not celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because the last time, with two penalties to shoot we were already ready to finish it, and I believe it's a
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not worry him, because he trusts in his players: "We never try to get to the series of penalties, we try to finish in the regular time frame, but sometimes we have only to prepare, the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately the fate made us a bad turn, sometimes it's the emotions or the anguish in our hands to hold the title.
Romano now has the opportunity to stop being a sub-champion technician and taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining a visa
Individuals must go to the Visa Applicant Service Centres prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost of waiting time will be reduced.
From 10 January 2011 the visa processing procedure at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
Under the new procedure, the majority of applicants will be required to report to the Visa Applicant Service Centres (ASCs) prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
CSA staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including the following:
The total cost to process the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make one payment to get an appointment, another payment for visa processing and another for the mail service to deliver the document.
The applicant will make a one-time payment that will cover all three services.
The current tariff will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for visas for traders and investors.
Individuals wishing to renew their visas will not be required to appear for an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only appear at the nearest CSA where they will present the documents and their fingerprints will be taken.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be taken into the CSA, applicants who wish to have a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will stay there less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants at the Consulates of Ciudad Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the $26 extra service fee.

NASA to announce discovery of extraterrestrial life
The U.S. space agency has quoted the press as presenting a discovery tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will communicate tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a news conference tomorrow at 1:00 p.m. at NASA Headquarters in Washington for experts in astrobiology, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When it quoted the press, NASA assured that it would present who would have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life,” which sparked speculation from experts in other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if their living conditions are improved.
It seems that we are talking about a microbe discovered at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, that lives in an environment that was thought to be too poisonous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any case, the creature uses arsenic as a way of life and this ability makes us think that similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our voluntary atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know."
The space agency will communicate the true scope of the findings at tomorrow's press conference on Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiology Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn's largest satellite), from the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Germe PRD, PT, Convergencia et Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n 'bloc' opposing
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, the arrival of 'bipartism' is made possible, it is denounced.
The 60th had just settled when in Congress appeared an opposing bloc led by the deputies of PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Manuel Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo, who declared himself independent and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartism' in the Chambers.
Before initiating the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo, 'tonnét' against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them,
With this reform, they reiterated, we are initiating 'bipartisanship' because now there are two people, from the same number of parties, who control the Congress.
These four MPs, alongside Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones to vote against the Board chaired by PANist Salvador L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Brito and Luis Antonio C<0xC3><0xA1>rdenas Fonseca, as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that with these reforms in an institutional way we constitute the political marginality on the part of PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that in the following days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme starting from a political will and if they do not have it, they will again be enslaved by both parties and in this way the opposing coalition will end.
"So far it has arrived (the opposing coalition), that's what I'm looking at, because we are excluded from any decision, they don't even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, of Convergencia mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress, having been monopolistic, should now be "duopolistic".
“It is not the spirit of law reform that there is eternal bipartisanship in Congress.”
To begin with, this group starts with 5 legislators and they are now talking to other colleagues to make them more numerous, the Convergent abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT, explained that now the Congress has turned into a 'bout' between two, alluding to PAN and PRI.
“Before there was only one party, now they divide it in two.”
Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo asked to respect the personality of the deputy, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"That they do not leave by cupular agreements out to five who will probably be nine MPs, now to the five we see, separated into different fractions, we have decided to unite to seek a place in the negotiating table, that is the problem, that in the reform that they have made, that they have decided, we are out and we do not agree with this reform."
$200 million more for "the supplier"
The City of Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n pays another check to the questioned owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another check of about 200 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Hall.
With this, the amount that was paid this second semester to the owner of the electrical equipment company amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, this last check number 9258447 was issued last November 16 for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, in the concept of "liquidation of account suppliers".
Treasurer Luis Miguel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Moreno had said that the Commune would pay further amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the State Superior Audit to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, therefore, how many cheques will still be issued to Camacho Palazuelos.
"We didn't buy anything, we just pay him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last cheques "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29 and the latter on November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official State Gazette, according to the provisions of the Act when a company is questioned by ASE, to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer has assured that they have not used its services again.
All this, after 25 July Northwest had published a review of the checks that the City Council issues to its suppliers, revealing that in the interval March 2008 - July 2010, in the triennate of Mayor Jorge Abel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, the Municipality paid Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos, through 42 checks.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, cashing checks of more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites must be taken care of
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist because of the poor conditions of the roundabout S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada in Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a hollow of the roundabout S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada, the tourism sector of Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n has asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in poor conditions and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Golden Zone Merchants Association, recalled that they have repeatedly called for the image of the destination to be taken care of and new activities must replace others that tourists find bad.
He said the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks has affected as tourists come to walk there and they see the mess and avoid nearby shops.
“Politicians don’t know what it means to close a business one day and they don’t know the fortune you lose, elsewhere they didn’t do the work for so long and without proper planning.”
The hotelier José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance on the part of the City Hall.
"The municipality will have to take responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do it, so through a preventive interview and only make the correction," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be maintained, but as inhabitants who deserve a clean place to live there and the City Council must change its strategy to maintain the city well."
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it only depends on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"They have not been given the attention they need and this kind of fact underscores something that is notorious for everyone, maintenance is necessary."
Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Llera Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez, under Secretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the recovery of the tourist sites of Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n is urgent, because they are not used properly and project a bad image.
He talked about a series of places that must get in line together with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up-to-date, clean, orderly and attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
“Fortunately Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n offers a lot of historical and cultural sites and places that we should order first, clean up and put online to make them attractive so we can add them to the inventory we have to promote this destination.”
IP Calls for Results in Congress
Eduardo D<0xC3><0xA1>valos, President of CCE, proposed that MEPs should assume the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations they face.
The business sector in Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n is calling for a dignified and agreement-free working legislature between the parties and the government executive, as Sinaloa is convulsed and faces major problems.
Yesterday we installed the 60th legislature formed by seven political forces, 19 deputies of PRI, 13 of PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and one of PVEM, in total 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations that the new members of the Government Congress is a clean and committed management with society and the different sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same models of party spirit or paternalism do not repeat.
Eduardo D<0xC3><0xA1>valos, President of CCE, proposed that MEPs should assume the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations they face.
"We hope that the MPs will actually exercise their right, free from agreements between the parties because the custom is that they make pacts to safeguard their own interests and they turn into a carnival masquerade of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary factions."
That is why I ask them to certify the commitment to build the necessary bridges that the current Governor is advancing.
“We will ensure that they do a dignified and above all committed work with society and sectors because the people of Sinaloa gave them their vote of confidence in the past elections.
José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotels Association, considered that one of the great provocations of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces in seeking the economic growth of the State, because now the economic situation is very complicated.
“The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure and that in a way will stimulate the generation of jobs.”
With regard to tourism, he asked that the new legislators give it the importance it has in the government budget to consolidate the Governmental Tourism Secretariat.
"I understand that this is the second State Secretariat with a smaller budget and it is incongruous as an important economic activity that generates currency and investment and that competes directly with agro-industry."
Aside from the fact that resources must be classified to detonating tourism projects that help to give security to the state and update the Alcohol Act that previous legislatures have not been able to resolve.
We are looking for King Mage
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Magi will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, because their home is formed by no more and no less than 12 people and a kid.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s, José Alfredo, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, Isa<0xC3><0xAD>as, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will bring them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live day to day because their father does not have a stable job.
“Sometimes it’s very difficult for us, because my husband doesn’t have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... and in the afternoon I go out with the ‘plebes’ for sale on the street,” says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaida, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bicycle, and her sister Isabel, 3 years old, wants a Barbie doll.
In turn, 10-year-old José Alfredo has long aspired to have a 'monster truck' and for his little brother Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s, 8 months, Cayetana suggests size clothes for a year.
“He said to me (José Alfredo), ‘I wish I had this monster,’ but I said ‘we’ll see, my son,’ because he was very expensive,” Cayetana recalls sadly.
For older children, who was in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, 11, is wearing size 12, Isa<0xC3><0xAD>as, 10, is wearing size 10, while Miguel, 8, is wearing size 8.
14-year-old Jose Juan needs a pair of sports shoes, so a size five-and-a-half or six pair would help him a lot.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true you can participate in the campaign On Search King Mage, giving a toy or money at the reception of Noroeste.
14 suspected drug traffickers arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in Estrie on Wednesday as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The raids took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in locations that would have been used for drug production.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment used for production were seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the S<0xC3><0xBB>reté du Québec.
In all, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged heads of this network, two men from Sherbrooke.
Those arrested had to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face accusations of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
The search came as a result of a long-running investigation, which lasted nearly a year.
"It was information received from the public that allowed us to proceed with these arrests," Ruel said.
Some 70 police officers from the regional investigative module of the Estrie de la S<0xC3><0xBB>reté du Québec, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Régie de police Memphrémagog, took part in this police operation.
Illegal migration can continue without problems
The Conservatives' bill, which the government says should solve the problem of boats carrying illegal migrants, is clearly going to be defeated as the three opposition parties said on Wednesday they could not support it.
"I strongly support the Charter."
“I stand with a party that created the granite under your feet,” Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff said as he was surrounded by MPs after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals argue that the proposed bill, which would allow for up to a year's detention of anyone from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Bloc Québécois, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill, because he is targeting the wrong target.
"We are against it and it seems that all the opposition parties are against it, so we will see what the government will do," Duceppe said.
The NDP’s immigration critique, Olivia Chow, shrugged off criticism that her party was not strong enough about illegal immigrants.
“The New Democrats agree that we should take action against illegal smugglers and that’s what we’re doing through another bill, C-35,” Chow said.
“We don’t support the Conservative bill because it targets refugees and imprisons children for at least a year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
“Canadians are massively telling MPs that they don’t tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country like a doormat.”
"They expect Canada to take firm action," said Minister Kenney.
The government did not announce a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led the country to elections in the event of its rejection.
A Conservative, however, told the QMI Agency that the government would ask for a vote so that every member who opposes it would then explain themselves to their constituents.
The new unity is not unanimous.
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to fight corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public inquiry commission on the subject.
Public Safety Minister Robert Dutil argues that this idea is not dated yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Investigation of New York on this issue as early as last January.
The metropolis has had a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
Tuesday’s announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Conseil permanent sur les services policiers du Québec on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It didn’t take much more for the critic of public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, to call this announcement a “rabbit out of a hat” and a “do-it-yourself solution on the corner of a table”.
Minister Dutil responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence over possible future unity.
“You’ll see the result when we announce it, he just says.”
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public investigation.
“The more Mr. Charest persists in not wanting to set up this commission of inquiry, the more people like you and me think he has something to hide,” he said.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the <0xC3><0x89>cole nationale d'administration publique.
To get out of this impasse, he suggests Quebec give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Auditor General," he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the cartons of the Charest government.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code in order to be better adapted to this type of crime.
This request would come from the prosecutor of Operation Hammer, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence is not explicit in such investigations.
Federal Minister of Public Safety Vic Toews has confirmed that his Justice colleague Rob Nicholson is currently considering certain amendments related to the matter.
In Operation Spring 2001, which targeted motorcycle groups, even though the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently passed the Gangster Act.
Rivers under high surveillance
Several streams remain under high surveillance due to heavy rainfall that has hit several parts of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening, another slip occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
A road has collapsed.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall fell in several regions, 40 to 70 millimeters of rain.
An additional 20 to 40 millimeters of rain were expected by Thursday night, depending on the region.
Sectors north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimeters of rain in total.
As these precipitations must be added to the melting of snow already accumulated in some areas, there are fears of the overflow of several streams.
Flood warnings were issued Wednesday evening by the Quebec Civil Security for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers, in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
The rivers of the North, at Saint-Jér<0xC3><0xB4>me, in the Laurentians, and of the Oak, in Lotbini<0xC3><0xA8>re, were subject to flood watch and remained under surveillance.
In the region of Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re, heavy rainfall led to the overflow of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was swept away due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the overflow of some lakes has led to the closure of several roads, notably in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Civilian Security remains on high alert and monitors the situation closely, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Quebec Flood Forecasting Centre on Wednesday issued warnings of heavy flooding for several rivers, including Maskinongé, L'Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Le Loup.
Dupont partially blamed
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CCNR) for controversial remarks about social assistance and Haitians as well as his coarse language on the air.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinions, but that some of the comments contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, unduly negative representations of Haitians and rude language that is not suitable for broadcasts during the day".
The Commission also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the release of the names of two persons who had committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CBSC had received several complaints about comments made during broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the Front Commun des personnes assistancees sociales du Québec.
The Panel complained that the amounts quoted in the issue were inaccurate.
The facilitators must present solid information rather than misleading information.
Regarding suicide, the facilitator Stéphane Dupont had considered that suicide is a cowardly gesture.
The majority of Committee members concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to the problems of life.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes questioned of "After noon" have addressed a sensitive topic in a fair and appropriate manner."
No blame has been laid on him.
The last litigation concerned statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had then given themselves to a face-to-face media that had aroused a lot of reactions.
The host of CHOI said that he had made no donations to help Haitians because we could not know with certainty that people in need would really receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already purged my three-day suspension on this."
"My file has been blank for a year and a half," the host said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the spread of coarse language.
In each case, the broadcaster CHOI-FM collaborated "beyond its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station, which will, among other things, have to announce these decisions once during the peak hours within three days.
A kung-fu king in Montreal
The Montrealer of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special career.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing climbs the tatami and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
“I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria,” said Zemmal, who has been living in the city since 2008.
"In my case, I'm looking for fights everywhere, since for those who don't like ground play in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the security officer and UPS clerk delivered bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) Amateur World Championships, October 23-30, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing categories," he said.
"Currently, I am preparing to go to China for the San Shou World Cup."
"The fighters who finished in the top four at the last World Championship in each category were invited."
"I won bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, while I came third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"What's interesting is that I've made progress in every competition."
"At this rate, I'll be first this time or next year!"
San shou or sanda is a discipline originating in China where punches and kicks, as well as ground projections, are allowed.
Duels originally take place on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most renowned boxer from this form of combat is the Vietnamese-American Cung Le, well-known in the martial arts world.
If Nacer Zemmal has to remember only one event in his career, he will certainly respond to his presence at the super tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China," said the friendly guy.
"It's a bit like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the biggest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first fight, in the semi-final of his class (80 kg), before losing in the final.
“The one who defeated me was a real pro,” he said.
"There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals are competing in the final of their category."
“Then the winners of each category face off to crown a single champion, the king of kung fu.”
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has awarded $450 million in voluntary contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, a consortium of companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor obtained the most important, that of the project management, for a sum of 295 million dollars without invitation to tender.
This consortium called <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance was formed in 2004 in conjunction with Hydro-Québec's decision to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance won the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, the use of business consortia poses a serious ethical problem that risks eliminating competition and causing higher prices.
“This is the new way to collude and bring down competition.”
“In other words, people, instead of doing it secretly, are now doing it openly,” Sylvain Simard, a member of parliament for Beijing, told a news conference yesterday.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he said he could hardly see how the public interest could be served in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, vigorously denying that there was collusion for this contract.
“I’m starting to have my journey,” she said, claiming that the PQ had been “dishonest” and had “lacked rigor.”
She said that "it would be the slightest thing" that the PQ apologized.
Consortium formula is a common practice around the world.
This is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project is highly complex given the scale of the work.
The project is underway and is scheduled to run until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition; there was negotiation.
Also, the consortia formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the formula for consortia in the consulting engineering sector is being investigated by the government.
A quick survey of the Québec business register allows to count more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
Thus, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and others Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads back to one and the same legal entity, Dessau.
With regard to the Energy Management Consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the James Bay territory responds to particular labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has been responding in a particular way since the 1970s".
The Eastmain project's chief executive, Réal Laporte of the James Bay Energy Corporation (JBSC), gave an explanation that made it clear that the project's management contract was awarded on a voluntary basis.
"If you go to tender and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: either you take the people who are in that market and you say: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"But the idea is that it is not the price that is important, it is the competence of the people," said Mr. Laporte.
This contract awarded to the Consortium <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 consulting engineering contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has won 22 contracts, Génivar has won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not counting its participation in <0xC3><0x89>nergie génération.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the contract to Energy Management of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four firms that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau dropped that the PQ is also linked to those firms that "finance" it, before specifying that it was rather its leaders.
Responsible Consumption Barometer - The "green" label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in sustainable development actors, but also in fair trade brands and green certifications to guide their choices.
Worse, even if he bathes in a media universe where messages in favor of a more responsible consumption are plentiful, he deplores a lack of credible information, a lack that he even describes as a brake on his commitment, indicates the Barometer of Responsible Consumption, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Although they increased the consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say they do not believe in the environmental commitment of companies as well as the green advertising of companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of Responsible Consumption of Sherbrooke University.
Another observation: half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications on so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that are shown to be eco-responsible, says the Barometer.
In the same vein, politicians’ discourse on this topic is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
Information on responsible consumption, however, seems essential to stimulate this part of consumption currently animated by almost a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the emptiness and dubious nature of the information would calm the ardor of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers say they are equally suspicious of the alleged performance of green products or services that are being put into their hands.
On another note, almost half of consumers in 2010 changed their habits and especially changed the brand of one or more products to meet their conviction.
By 61%, they have also favoured shopping with local retailers and the purchase of food products grown in their area, the Barometer says.
Greener and more responsible - the Responsible Consumption Index has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 this year - Quebec's Homo consumus likes to present itself as the king of recycling that seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by caring for the protection of animals.
But his social and ecological awareness seems to remain outside his car, says the Barometer: in 2010, barely 28% of Quebecers indicated that they had used public transport or advocated carpooling to defend their green interests.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this extensive behavioral survey, which just took its first snapshot.
A state loan for the purchase of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to commit financially to the acquisition of the eXcentris film complex by Société Angus and Parallele, agrees to cooperate, but with only one loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallele, who had hoped for a donation of $7 million from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris film complex on Saint-Laurent Boulevard by restoring it to its full cinematic vocation, did not get what they demanded.
The government agrees to get involved in the matter, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan whose amount would indeed be lower than the initial expectations, which could constitute a viable solution at advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of sources from the State offices.
A first action plan and a $12.8 million application had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but requests have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and an action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Macerola, who is leading the eXcentris dossier.
He sent her a final report about ten days ago.
But the cabinet’s counter-proposal reached SODEC on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until December 31 to respond.
It seems, however, that the assumption of the gift of the State really needs to be dismissed.
Recall that the Association des proprietaires de cinéparcs du Québec was opposed to a direct investment by the State to support the acquisition of eXcentris, arguing that the Minist<0xC3><0xA8>re de la Culture did not have to finance real estate projects, which it did not do for other cinemas.
On the contrary, many stakeholders were asking for substantial economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the master of céans, for ten years carried the author's cinema in his premises of the complex after having financed its construction himself, which could justify a waiver by the Treasury Board.
The lack of rooms for independent films is crying in Montreal, and eXcentris had been able to retain its clientele.
The Angus Company and the Parallel, with Christian Yaccarini at their head, are running a private financing campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to push the acquisition wheel.
Since spring 2009, only one of the three screens, Le Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le, continues to broadcast films at eXcentris.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen the three theaters on February 27th by screening the very beautiful film of Xavier Beauvois Des hommes et des deux.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall Le Devoir and we do not know what he and his group think of the downward proposals that are made to them.
The veil lifted over a complex Canada...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks lift the veil on what the U.S. considers the complex of inferiority of Canadians to Americans, but they also betray their sense of superiority to Canada.
Thus, American diplomats are surprised that every Canadian voter does not have Canadian-American relations in mind by going to vote and believe that President Obama’s visit helped the Conservative government pass its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, spread out in the public square yesterday, offer more crisp details than substantial content to put under the tooth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, in the middle of the federal election campaign, tells how much the United States is not part of the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the astonishment of the U.S. Ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations for this situation.
“An almost inherent Canadian inferiority complex may condition Canadian political leaders to talk about domestic issues of everyday life rather than bringing this election to the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign),” he writes.
The United States is therefore, he concludes, "the proverbial elephant of this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to talk about."
The ambassador understands all the less this "deafening silence" as the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
“Logically, the ability of a candidate, a party, and even more than one party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind when going to vote.”
The other expression of this sense of importance is in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, a businessman in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Your trip will help ensure the government’s survival in the February vote of confidence on the federal budget, where Canada will post its first deficit in more than a decade because of a $30-$40 billion stimulus plan,” Breese wrote.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to prorogue Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that the opposition parties made its survival conditional on the quality of the proposed stimulus plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that the dramas broadcast on CBC refer to the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the shows Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there are subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or the abductions for muscular interrogations of the CIA.
Another cable reports that, during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome some Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo prisoners.
Mr Kouchner answered yes, but on a case-by-case basis.
At the end of the meeting, it is written, "he handed a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The secretary has agreed to review the file."
Finally, let's note that the spirits are heating up about the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC's airwaves that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "murdered".
He echoed Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A global plan to renovate lighting
The United Nations proposed in Canc<0xC3><0xBA>n yesterday a plan to renovate domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gases (GHG) that corresponds to almost one-third of the additional reduction that must be achieved to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in line with the major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to adopt in Canc<0xC3><0xBA>n to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments by industrialized countries.
According to the plan filed yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs that still monopolize 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by compact fluorescent bulbs or, better, by light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs, the bulk of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet to illuminate humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the global car fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitting countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that are expected to increase global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to subtract from this balance sheet another 5 Gt to achieve stabilization by 2020 the increase of the climate to 2 degrees centigrade in order to avoid that it becomes out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy dissipates as heat and the rest, 5%, produces light.
With compact fluorescent bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, this energy requirement is reduced by two more times.
Compact fluorescent bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by Philips this week - this company has also participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which gives an idea of the possible economy with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These brand new bulbs can also work with rheostats in addition to emitting very little heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about compact fluorescent light bulbs because they contain mercury and must be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers put in place guidelines.
But, says the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact fluorescent light bulb, but rather coal-fired thermal power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce electricity wasted in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the gains each country would make from this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save one billion dollars a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost 2.5 billion.
C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire waits nervously for election results to be announced
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for the results of the presidential election in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire to be published "without delay" after the deadlines expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results without further delay," a spokesman for the UN chief said.
"It calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to show responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the election commission missed Wednesday’s midnight deadline without publishing the results, three days after Sunday’s election.
Approximately 40 minutes before the deadline, the CIS president said on television that the commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
The calls have multiplied Wednesday in the world for the CIS to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp counts on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of "fraudulent" votes in the north, held by the ex-rebellion of the Forces Nouvelles (FN) since the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign manager of the Ivorian president, said that the intimidation of voters by the FN in the north of the country had deterred supporters of the outgoing president from going to vote.
The entire election could be cancelled if Gbagbo's complaints are upheld by the Constitutional Council.
Gbagbo’s opponents believe the country’s highest court is not neutral because it is headed by Paul Yao N’Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the North who denies any connection to the ex-rebels, called the delay in announcing the results "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go so far as to claim victory.
His allies say Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has lost and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council, after preventing the electoral commission from disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election on Sunday was supposed to crown the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that remained divided in two for years.
The United Nations warned the Ivorian political class on Wednesday that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished first in the first round on 31 October, with 38% of the vote against 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate remained stable in France in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France in the sense of the International Labour Office (ILO) remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% when counting the overseas departments), show the provisional seasonally adjusted data (SVC) published Thursday by the INSEE.
The number of unemployed is 2,631 million in the metropolis.
The data for the second quarter were confirmed to 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% with the DOM.
Over one year, the unemployment rate is up 0.1 points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France were not working in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available within two weeks to work and whether or not they were looking for a job.
The situation of young people in the labour market has deteriorated further, with a further increase in the unemployment rate, rising to 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 points over three months, + 0.5 points over one year) and 25% including the DOMs.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed under the ILO.
Seniors, for their part, experienced a slight increase in unemployment, to 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 points over three months as well as over one year), i.e. 482,000 people aged 50 and over, and 6.6% with the DOMs.
Only the 25-49 year-olds benefited from stable unemployment in the third quarter, at 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 point over three months, +0.1 point over one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
The INSEE has not published a monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after a controversy over its calculation method.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistics agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini arrested and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53, leader of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS president of the General Council of Les Bouches-du-Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne, was indicted and nutted at the Luynes arrest house near Aix-en-Provence as part of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guérini has been charged with abuse of social property, misappropriation of funds and public property, secrecy, active corruption, influence trafficking and possession of ammunition, his lawyer says.
"Alexander Guerini is combative and wants to explain himself on all the questions that the magistrate will ask him, not fantasies."
"It's easy to sue him for a multitude of reprehensible chiefs, it's another thing to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before her client's hearing.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the strongman of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, wanted, through his lawyers, to pass to the judge before his hearing a memo to explain.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also indicted Wednesday night and nutted.
According to his lawyer, Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything other than run the dumps he had to manage.
As for the award of contracts or the destination of funds related to their operation, he was never aware of it, said Mr Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the agglomeration of Aubagne, was examined Wednesday for embezzlement of public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial control with prohibition of meeting the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to provide explanations for the facts that are accused of him."
"The investigating magistrate took this into account by not depriving him of his liberty," said his lawyer, Mr Yann Arnoux.
Four other people were arrested and released on Wednesday night, with two of them placed under judicial supervision, Deputy Attorney General Michel Raffin said.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy general manager of cleanliness of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for "trafficking in influence and passive corruption".
Two officials of the Aubagne agglomeration, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are being investigated, one for "abduction and misappropriation of public property by a person charged with a public service mission", the other for "complicity in misappropriation of public funds".
Finally, Alexandre Guérini’s partner, Jeannie Peretti, was charged with “abuse of social property”.
Among those confronted by Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently caught in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement in Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies of having been used to launder money from big banditry.
The investigation is being carried out in the context of several court reports opened against X in April 2009 following anonymous mails, for alleged fraud in public procurement, in particular in the waste sector.
From a source close to the investigation, the investigations focus in particular on the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill of La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne as well as some cities of the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: the Elysee exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "espionage", has held opinion in breath in France, put diplomacy on high alert, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of U.S. diplomats.
American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some of the background to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysee explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice on dealing with their own “hostage” crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials sought to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman did not have as its counterpart the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by the US justice for trafficking materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they cast a harsh light on how the French presidency sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In reality, it was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to handle hostage cases".
The Elysee’s strategic affairs adviser, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d’Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, meet with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the same to repatriate their own forcibly detained nationals to Iran.
"Make noise", they say, "hammer constantly" in the media the words "fundamental human rights", "innocence", "immediate liberation".
It is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
“Do it all the more because the Iranians are asking you not to do it.”
Because, after the attempts of discussions through discreet channels, "silence will not settle anything", the Iranians are "masters in delaying maneuvers".
Richier added that the arrest of foreigners is “a familiar Iranian tactic: the taking of hostages for political blackmail.”
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which will take place on August 16, the day she takes refuge in the French embassy) "will require the payment to the Iranians of a large sum of money" (230,000 euros of bail).
And he said that the Elysee is anticipating other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will worsen".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
August 28, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison for 12 days but remains stranded in Iran.
An information is released: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose US demands the extradition for illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released in Paris, at the decision of a judge.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, is questioning this troubling coincidence.
For Washington, which hunts down Iran’s clandestine nuclear hardware acquisition networks, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Did France accept a bargain?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French?
During a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysee, he said, not only “was completely taken by surprise by the judge’s decision,” but sought to oppose it.
"There have been lively exchanges between the French presidency and the guard of the seals" (at the time, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie), but "the French government can not return to the judicial decision", he observes.
Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under "close" surveillance by French intelligence services.
The Elysee’s adviser dials a phone number, hangs up, and then informs the US diplomat that the Iranian “is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy.”
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysee does not spare its efforts, through communiqués and organized "leaks" in the media, to make it appear that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influenced" role as a "mediator".
Americans observe this activity not without irony, and find that the manipulation bears fruit since several press articles reverberate the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 evokes "the media 'blitz' of French officials".
On what is based so much "gratitude" expressed to Mr. Assad, asks the embassy in Paris.
“Despite their praiseworthy statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done.”
The document then looks at the reasons that prompted the Elysee to pour into this fiction.
The intense communication effort "aims to validate Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he said.
A policy launched in 2008, which "had then been perceived, by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and undeserved".
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris seeks to "demonstrate to Syria what praise it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to “sow seeds of discord between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier told him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians did anything."
“But we thanked them anyway.”
"This should at least cause confusion among Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy received it at the Elysee.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their “active role in favor of the liberation of our compatriot.”
No online games for young Koreans past midnight
The South Korean government will pass a so-called “Cinderella” law that will ban teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight, young people under the age of 16, said representatives of the ministries of culture and family.
“A lot of kids play these games all night and then have a hard time studying at school and having a normal life during the day.”
"We believe that this law is necessary to guarantee their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin, the minister in charge of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, he said.
The government is also considering asking companies to limit daily access to these games for young people whose parents request it, the official added.
It will also make available to people who demand it free software that allows to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to heavy Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, compared to 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints organising countries
In the midst of turmoil over suspected corruption, the FIFA Executive Committee on Thursday designated the countries hosting the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, an eminently political choice where influence struggles and lobbying risk taking precedence over technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the FIFA Queen Competition will take place in Europe, the traditional bastion of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The one of 2022 will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its establishment in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities in the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives a measure of the economic and political stakes of a World Cup.
Behind-the-scenes negotiations are therefore likely to last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not weigh very heavily on the 22 members of the executive committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, at the origin of the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), may have ruined the chances of his country, the cradle of football that hosted the World Cup only once, in 1966.
The BBC put a layer on it Monday, broadcasting a documentary that pins three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What displease FIFA and embarrass the British officials, who have embarked on intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron in the front line.
The head of the government hopes to reissue the successful coup by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had obtained in 2005 for London the organization of the Olympics-2012.
Will this intense activity suffice to restore England's coat of arms to the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the duo Spain-Portugal does not lack in assets with its stadiums already ready, its expertise (Mondial-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the two countries’ bleak economic and financial prospects could dampen their ambitions.
The possible retaliation against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the rating of Russia, which has become a major outsider despite the shortcomings of its file (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to make the trip to Zurich and denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a barely veiled allusion to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
“We cover them with mud, we try to compromise them,” Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, backed by the 1994 experience, appears to be the logical favorite.
As the world's leading economic power, home to FIFA's main sponsors, the country seems to be one step ahead of Japan and South Korea, which have built a very beautiful project separately.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries that co-hosted the event in 2002.
Another threat: the granting of the World Cup 2026 to China, ardently desired by FIFA, which would de facto make the Asian chances for 2022 obsolete.
With Qatar, which launched the big game with futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion to new countries, but these two countries pose more risk than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of TV fees paid (due to the time lag) by European countries, the nerve of war for FIFA.
Second term: the obvious
De Gaulle was hesitant.
Mitterrand had made him think he was hesitating.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
One warrant at the Elysee calls another.
So the current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But the evidence does not go well with the part of mystery attached to the presidential function.
Then we have to act as if the doubt still exists.
In one sense as in the other.
In 2006, even without believing it, Jacques Chirac’s friends claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On November 15, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would make his decision "somewhere in the autumn of 2011".
As he mentions in front of UMP parliamentarians, Tuesday evening at the Elysee, the prospect of "two mandates" has therefore sowed a little feverishness.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were far from it.
The president merely recalled that the 2008 constitutional revision limited the number of five-year terms to two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he has mentioned the presidential election, in a humorous tone, during such meetings.
"At worst, or at best, you still have seven and a half years with me," he told them in July 2009.
Rebellion in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next step."
His remarks of the day before make him no more a candidate than the day before; they make him no less.
If there are any comments, it is for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy to the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not Ségol<0xC3><0xA8>ne Royal’s entry into the competition that pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, because his candidacy in 2012 is obvious, many in the PS are calling for a battle order earlier than expected.
The bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time right-wing voters would prefer the candidacy of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP on this," the prime minister's entourage immediately and cautiously responded.
"If he believes defeat is possible, he will not be a candidate," said Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the obvious.
Euro: ECB forced to keep buying government bonds
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year was to be an opportunity to clarify how to get out of the crisis or, at least, to announce the cessation of many of the unconventional monetary policy operations that are due to be completed at the end of the year.
As the European sovereign debt crisis forces, the Frankfurt Institute of Issuance will probably not be able to afford to be so peremptory or worsen a more than tense situation on the European bond markets today.
The political cost would be even higher.
At a press conference yesterday, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde praised the ECB's active role in resolving the debt crisis in Europe.
It did not want to say whether it felt the central bank needed to do more, for example by increasing its program of buying sovereign bonds.
"I reserve my thoughts to my European partners (...)".
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not show more dissent about his intentions, merely indicating that the program of buying government bonds on the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we decide" at the meeting on Thursday.
Only certainty: the ECB will keep its main policy rate unchanged at 1%, its all-time low since May 2009.
In fact, the ECB’s purchases of treasury bonds doubled last week to nearly 1.35 billion euros.
And, according to the indiscretions of market operators, it made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem have bought for 67 billion euros since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt about the expectation of continued purchases (see page 29).
Economists also do not expect any notable change of course.
While the ECB's more than three-month lending operations have already disappeared from its arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited allocations of liquidity on generous terms and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists now expect this arrangement to be extended by a few months.
"I can't imagine that she's significantly changing her schedule."
“Otherwise it would risk further tensions in the short term,” said Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
"A gradual exit announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," said Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its interventions in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a purchasing volume of these bonds to animate a sluggish market," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its market presence.
"It must at all costs replace the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a run-up of the returns paid by the most fragile states," a senior bond manager testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates soar, states will be all the more embarrassed to reduce their debt, if not stabilize it.
The safeguarding of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government turns its back round
After a worrying start to the week for Italy, the situation eased a bit yesterday with the reflux of 10-year bond rates.
A return to precarious calm.
After a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents said they heard Giulio Tremonti call the situation "indecipherable" and expect an "unpredictable" weekend, which the interested party then denied.
In any case, on Tuesday, the gap with the German long rates had reached the record of 210 basis points and the price of hedging contracts against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) had soared to 263 points, leading to some unrest in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi pointed out that in Spain the gap with the German rates was over 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was "strongly concerned" about "market turbulence" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the eurozone’s third-largest economy, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” says Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In a nutshell, its problem is the lack of growth and the sluggishness of tax revenues that goes with it, putting the state at risk of no longer being able to cover its financing needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels have been a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected at 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget under consideration in the Senate is estimated at 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the public deficit will still represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% forecast by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor of a new budget collective that could be set up after the holidays, for an amount of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, further austerity measures will have to be taken," said Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy is receiving the support of international institutions.
"The fundamentals of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we have been repeating it for a long time," said Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, neither short-term nor long-term, because despite its large debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDR), the stabilization efforts demanded from Italy are less than those demanded from other countries," notes Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
There remains the question of political instability.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, after which early elections could be held at the end of March.
This would open up a period not conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde hammered it again yesterday in the context of a press conference in Paris: "Europeans, I believe that it has been demonstrated again Sunday in the day and in the night, are obviously solidary, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone."
Although all relative, yesterday's easing of European government bond rates has brought water to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But we cannot yet speak of a beginning of normalization.
Rating agency Standard & Poor's has announced that it could degrade Portugal's debt rating, the target most targeted by speculation today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which weighs on banking systems in particular," say the economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially since "political time is much slower than market time".
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it holds, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their G20 peers are going well.
And this is also in view of the meetings of the Eurogroup and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the menu, the fate of unconventional measures to support euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, began a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground.
The first issuances of EFSF securities are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, a US official told Reuters that the United States would support a possible increase in funds mobilized by an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The front-line countries, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular in terms of labour market organisation.
Reforms in addition to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path from those of Greece and Ireland.
Both sides are keen to avoid seeking international assistance before implementing their own budgetary corrections and deciding on the structural reforms necessary to restore lasting confidence.
Finally, European donors are discussing the options available to speed up the process of standardising sovereign bond markets.
While in Paris, on November 24, Axel Weber had first put forward the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to hand over the portfolio.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, believe that an extension of around 100 billion euros would suffice, "preferably" in the form of direct injection of liquidity.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism with, to date, €60 billion.
A council that has every chance of being carefully examined in European capitals.
Especially if market conditions worsen.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange vigilance
Snow events still cause traffic difficulties, especially on the secondary network in Brittany, and risk disrupting some economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange alert due to the risk of snow and ice.
The Eure, the Eure-et-Loir, the Deux-S<0xC3><0xA8>vres and the Vienne, joined the 20 departments already in orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, sustained snow showers affect the north of the Gironde and the Charentes and it snows weakly on the Ile-de-France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, punctually from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of Charente, Charente-Maritime, C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin regions.
Snow episodes are notable enough to cause traffic difficulties and disrupt some economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, several departments were prohibited to heavy trucks of more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
Traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to the gendarmes who recommend that you take your vehicle only in case of need and the circulation of some TER buses has been suspended for the day.
School transportation was banned for Thursday in Picardy.
No specific measures were envisaged on Wednesday evening to restrict the movement of heavy goods vehicles.
The prefecture "invites all motorists to exercise the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving accordingly".
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights at the Paris airport of Roissy and 10% in Orly due to the upcoming snowfall.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate around the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France is in full swing, billions are raining.
In the discussion at least.
In particular, 23 billion are mentioned for the metro Grand Paris that the Société du Grand Paris is to build.
To start this SGP, the State has announced a capital endowment of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, it is this sum that will then allow the GSP to borrow a share of the financing of its double loop on the markets.
Today, we finally get to the first additions.
The amending Finance Act 2010, considered in the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the arrangements planned to find the beginning of this money.
There are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, it reads in the text of the bill, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is quantified: "The proceeds of this tax is 117 million euros per year".
The second is a reorganization of a tax on offices that already exists "in order to modernize it, to increase the product and to allocate this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that make?
Mysterious.
This is not ciphered in the text.
We are far from 4 billion.
"It is specified that these tax resources are in addition to the 4 billion euros of the capital endowment that will be mobilized by the State and brought to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses," the statement said.
At the SGP, we do not find this system shocking.
"From the moment we create revenues, we can cover the studies over three years and then tap into the 4 billion after," they explain.
"It will be entered in the budget and drawn as it goes."
The GSP estimates that the $4 billion will begin to be entered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the promised $4 billion is still to absent subscribers, risks provoking a somewhat hectic parliamentary discussion.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Vengeful hackers and spies in diligence
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it turns out to be an apparent scandal, a scandal that appears as a scandal only in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it heralds profound changes at the international level, and predicts a future dominated by regression.
But let's proceed in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that every file made up of a secret service (of any nation) is composed exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits only report what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those of which Berlusconi owns), and Gaddafi's sinisterly caricatured profile was long ago for cabaret artists sketch material.
The rule that secret files should only be composed of new ones that are already known is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a bookstore devoted to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau, the Templars or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in the previous works.
And this not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do unpublished research (nor does he know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism only believe what they already know, and who reconfirms what they had already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
Same goes for secret files.
The whistleblower is lazy, and lazy (or limited-minded) the head of the secret service (otherwise he could be, what I know, an editor at Liberation), who holds as true only what he acknowledges.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the US embassy in Rome sent to the State Department was the same as Newsweek published the week before.
So why did the revelations about these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what any cultivated person already knows, namely that embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the heads of state can call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small representation exercises, have turned into spy centers.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is only by hypocrisy that we pretend to ignore it.
However, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to misplace American diplomacy.
Second, the idea that any hacker can capture the most secretive secrets of the world’s most powerful country is a significant blow to the State Department’s prestige.
Therefore, the scandal does not put the victims in crisis as much as the “stupid ones”.
But let’s come to the deep nature of what happened.
In Orwell’s time, one could conceive of all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had been completely true since, being able to control every movement through the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway taken and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when we demonstrate, as it happens now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker – elected as the citizen’s avenger – can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said, that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true, that everything to know about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed an empty secret of secrecy, because it belongs in the public domain; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton’s secrets were empty secrets means to take away all power from her.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but has done too much harm to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound inflicted on a very powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future, states will no longer be able to post any confidential information online - that would be like publishing it on a poster pasted around the corner.
But it is equally obvious that with current technologies, it is hopeless to be able to maintain confidential reports over the phone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a head of state flew a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How will private and confidential relationships be maintained in the future?
I know well that, for the moment, my prediction is science fiction and is therefore novelistic, but I am obliged to imagine government agents who move discreetly in diligences with uncontrollable routes, carrying only messages learned by heart or, at most, hiding the few information written in the heel of a chase.
The information will be kept as a single copy in locked drawers: at bottom, the Watergate spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now advancing in crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet restored a telegraph on wires (telephones).
Video cassettes (analog) had allowed film researchers to explore a film step by step, going back and forth and discovering all the secrets of editing, while now CDs (digital) only allow to jump from chapter to chapter, that is, in macroportions.
With high-speed trains, you can get from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, and the trips it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the politics and techniques of communication return to horse cars.
One last observation.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was being plotted in the secrecy of embassies.
Now, it is the embassies that are requesting confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France cheats on its financing promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to review the fulfilment of the promises of fast-start or early-start financing made by developed countries.
And the big French quagmires are revealed.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged €7.2 billion over three years and France has pledged €1.26 billion (or €420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU put out the big game to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start financing: report detailing the action of its member states, press conference, grand side event, distribution of brochures...
Transparency is appreciated and valued: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU announced that it had cleared €2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on track to meet its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look at the details, things are more complicated.
This money must, according to the Copenhagen agreement, be "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without being at the expense of ODA.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission has considered 2009 as a reference year: international financing is maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years for fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks in terms of the year or in terms of the level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers that the financing of "all the new projects" of the year 2010 are "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to expenditure in previous years or to the overall level of official development assistance.
Concretely, the total amount of support from France to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to respect its commitment to "new and additional" financing...
Another crucial element is the distribution between donations and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everyone chooses their own method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that 1€ lent is equivalent to 1€ given.
Of course, this is hardly justifiable: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for some investments that are profitable (often projects related to mitigation of emissions that rely on more efficient technologies), it is misleading to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is given... At most, should be counted under its commitments only the cost of the loan to the lending country (i.e. a rate equivalent).
But France has nothing to do with such a reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to check for yourself.
It is the only EU country to use the loan so massively.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (otherwise) meet their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union puts 1 euro to meet its commitment, France only puts 10 cents and considers the effort comparable.
Nice tour of passe-passe!
In short, in its fast start financing, France operates a double scam: on the one hand on the evolution of the action over time and on the other hand on the reality of the financial effort.
By spending only 36.1 million euros, it manages to make believe that it spends 420 million "new and additional" in line with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other member states continue to give if it is enough to lend?) and in the negotiations since the developing countries are not completely fooled...
The chapter on early funding is only a small, relatively short-term issue compared to all the climate discussions.
But it could be one more grain of sand in the huge machine that is the UNFCCC.
Hopefully this will not be the case.
In any case, the lessons learned from this first year of early funding are essential.
First, France could announce a change in its method of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and fairness with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could advance discussions on the issues of long-term financing (another crucial chapter currently discussed): we will not escape the question of "additionality" or how to account for loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
The hope therefore rests on the new Minister of the Environment, Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France's fast start and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would increase the level of international confidence needed to move forward in the discussions.
Alert to pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemicals in one day, according to a study published Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (formerly Movement for the Rights and Respect of Future Generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no significant statistical value in relation to the small number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem treated", bought between July and September the foods usually consumed in four meals and a snack in one day by a child of about ten years old, in supermarkets of Oise and Paris.
These standard meals, including official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day - as well as treats, were examined by laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The assessment of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals of which 42 are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five substances classified as certain carcinogens as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (EP), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Although, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, it is clear from our survey that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE contaminants is of concern," the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three proven as certain carcinogens as well as nearly twenty residues that can disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, predicted as a snack by the study, has traces of six chemicals, one of which is a fungicide banned in France.
The same goes for Kenyan green beans, included in lunch, on which the study detected traces of a potent insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, minced steak, canned tuna, and even breadstick and chewing gum were loaded with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap water the analysis revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, the salmon steak was the "richest" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the examination of the plastic plate used to heat the meal in the microwave was not exempt from it.
The final consumer risk of this "cocktail contaminant" "is probably underestimated," according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, proposed "faced with the urgency of the situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop "the increase in diseases of civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
