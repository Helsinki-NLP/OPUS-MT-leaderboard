Rapidly progressive cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases shows similar trends in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that while it is at a different stage depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is advancing rapidly in all countries.
Based on Italy’s experience, countries, hospitals and ICUs should prepare more for an outbreak of COVID-19 patients who will need care and especially intensive treatment.
On December 31, 2019, a portion of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, China’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the causative agent as a new coronavirus, now referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection is called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that 80% of people with COVID-19 develop a mild form of the disease, that is, a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 progresses to a more severe disease, requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases progress to a critical disease, requiring intensive treatment.
The mortality of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we evaluated trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and in the United Kingdom and compared them with those in Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK with that of Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 spread geographically, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world currently follows that of that country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The March 5 edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe, according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had already been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom, and between 31 December 2019 and the date mentioned above, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths had been reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Obtaining cumulative numbers and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in each country in the world, obtained only from official sources such as the country’s Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities and WHO, is updated every day at 8 a.m.
These data were used to assess trends in COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK, and to compare them with those in Italy.
As an approximation of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative 14-day truncated incidence of COVID-19 cases, taking into account, therefore, the natural evolution of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and in the United Kingdom, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases reported from each country by March 15, 2020 at 8 a.m., and compared it with Italy for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
Trends in COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
Trends in the cumulative 14-day truncated incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK in general followed those in Hubei Province, China (Figure 1).
In general, for the EU/EEA and the UK, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and then increased significantly around 28 February 2020 (complementary material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed similar increasing trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (complementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
As of March 15 at 8 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy 3 weeks or less ago.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trends observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a similar rate in all countries.
This occurs despite countries being in different stages, variations in the actions of national public health systems and possibly different case definitions in countries and different protocols for the selection of patients who should be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, including testing for update.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive treatment, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in those regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on hospitalization for cases of COVID-19 in a hospital and/or ICU are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not shown).
They should, however, be collected in a systematic way to complement current surveillance data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted between 2010 and 2011 showed a huge variation in the availability of ICU beds and semi-intensive units in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal for every 100,000 people.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 ICU beds and semi-intensive treatment for a population of 100,000 between 2010 and 2011).
Modeled scenarios related to health system capacity saturation, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the UK of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalisation cases associated with a 90% higher risk of intensive care bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
Since cases have so far been concentrated in certain regions of the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive care units generally serve a defined population of regional scope, information on cases and beds of intensive care should preferably be made available in the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistical Purposes 2 (NUTS-2).
The example of Italy and trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and ICUs should therefore prepare for a scenario of sustained community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and for an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 who will need medical assistance, especially intensive treatment, such as that occurring in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted in the ECDC’s rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from the containment approach to a mitigation approach, as the predicted rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide sufficient time for decision-makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their actions appropriately, if not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the epidemic.
There is a small window of opportunity during which countries have the possibility of stepping up their control initiatives to decrease the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and lower the pressure on the health system.
If these initiatives fail, healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to have an outbreak of patients who will need intensive treatment in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease epidemic (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and the rest of the world, resulting in a catastrophe for the population.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS, but is much more transmissive, and affects older people more than young people, and men more than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on the new disease, this paper seeks to provide a current and comprehensive assessment of the rapidly developing research object.
We will deal with the basic principles of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
While many questions still need answers, we hope this study will help in understanding and eradicating this hostile disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become a unique and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who were forced to be confined for the entire holiday and for several weeks thereafter due to the epidemic of a new viral disease.
The virus bears great resemblance to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the respective disease was named CoV-19 disease (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly across the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
By March 2, 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients recovered and more than 3,000 patients killed.
The WHO warns that COVID-19 is the “number one public enemy,” and is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 articles were published on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on January 7, 2020, which determined the sequencing of the virus isolated from several patients.
This article seeks to summarize the progress of research in this new area of rapid development.
Where relevant, we will compare COVID-19 to SARS and the other disease caused by CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, a 2012 epidemic).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as other urgent issues.
CoVs are traditionally considered non-lethal pathogens to humans, primarily causing about 15% of common colds.
However, in this century, we find twice highly pathogenic human CoVs, which are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causing an epidemic that originated in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and that soon spread to several other countries with frightening morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third epidemic of CoV in the documented history of the human being.
As shown in Fig.1,1, a portion of pneumonia cases with unknown origins were initially reported in Wuhan on December 31, 2019, to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the CoV sequencing was published.
On January 15, 2020, Wuhan's first fatal case was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic has spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, the contagion of health professionals was reported, suggesting that transmission between people was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was confined, with all public transport interrupted.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that of 41 patients with confirmed cases only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was considered the site of onset of contagion by an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the epidemic a global health emergency.
To date, the disease has spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Fig. 2).
As the situation rapidly worsens, the final size and severity of the epidemic will still need to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multicenter study with 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients confirmed with COVID-19, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic, as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, mostly in the 30-65 age group.
Nearly half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years old, some were under 20 years old, and only 14 infected were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has spread in groups, mainly in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 received an average of 5 (2 to 9) days for diagnosis based on the onset of symptoms.
The mean incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days.
The mean time to death based on symptom onset was 9.5 (4.8 to 13) days.
The baseline number of reproduction (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51 to 4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23 to 4.82.
The number of people infected grew exponentially before January 23, 2020, corresponding to the massive transportation time before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10% to 1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02% to 4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (over 60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large, encapsulated viruses that contain a single strand of RNA with a certain sense.
They can be divided into four genera, namely: alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha-coronaviruses and beta-coronaviruses are known to infect humans.
The spike glycoprotein (S) of the envelope binds to its angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ECA2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) cellular receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and, in sequence, membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, genomic RNA accompanied by encapsulated glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins forms vesicles containing virions, which bind to the plasma membrane and release the virus.
The first sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of beta-coronavirus with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequenced samples collected from the same original outbreak site, the Huanan Sea Fruit Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through the transmission electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were discovered in ultrafine sections of the epithelium of human airways.
Human ECA2 has been found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 protein S binds to human ECA2 protein weaker than SARS-CoV protein, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFN<0xCE><0xB2> expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known domain or functional motif.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., reported the cryo-MS structure of full-length human ECA2 at a resolution of 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> in a complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
It was found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was grouped as a dimer, and the ECA2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, which provides evidence for recognition and infection by CoV.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The host of origin and the intermediary
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans through civets and camels, respectively.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were considered the native hosts of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like Bat CoVs called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that helped the virus cross species barriers and infect humans remains unknown, and the route of transmission has yet to be discovered.
Ji, et al., suggests that snakes carry the virus from bats to humans, which involved a homologous recombination in protein S.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, have suggested that pangolins, elongated-mouthed mammals that feed on ants and are frequently used in traditional Chinese medicine, are the potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2, based on the 99% genetic homology between a CoV discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a difference of 1% in two genomes is a big difference; therefore, conclusive results for concrete evidence are being expected (Fig. 33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days below 20 <0xC2><0xB0>C with 40% to 50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat of 56 <0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, disinfectant with chlorine, peracetic acid, chloroform and other organic solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are efficient in deactivating the virus.
Overall, the entire human population has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed studies have been reported regarding the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only consult previous studies on other CoVs, mainly on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4).4).
In general, after a virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the host’s innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectin receptors, Toll-type receptors (TLRs), NOD-type receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-type receptors (RLRs).
Through different routes, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs), which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of macrophages of viral antigens.
However, the SARS-CoV protein N may help the virus escape immune responses.
In a short time, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce antibodies specific to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly kill cells infected by the virus.
Collaborative T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to aid in cell defense.
However, CoV can inhibit T cell functions by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, including supplements such as C3a and C5a antibodies, is also essential for fighting viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exacerbated immune system reaction generates a large number of local free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, at worst, multiple organ failure, and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by the appearance of symptoms in a group of people, affects older people with comorbidities and pregnant women more.
It is common for people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune system is compromised to have a higher chance of becoming infected than other people.
The average estimated incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days and, most often, 3 to 7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases shows that the incubation period was 3 days, on average, and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days, based on the demographics of 8,866 cases.
It is essential that health authorities adjust the actual quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period, thus preventing infected people who do not have symptoms from transmitting the virus to others.
As a common practice, individuals exposed to or infected with the virus usually need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended by 24 days?
Fever is usually the initial and main symptom of COVID-19, which can come on its own or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, runny nose, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of symptoms of the disease.
In severe cases, patients rapidly progressed to acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without abnormalities in lung imaging diagnosis, should undergo screening for the virus in order to receive an early diagnosis.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilatory support.
Similar results were reported in two recent studies of a family grouping and a grouping with transmission of an asymptomatic individual.
In comparison, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%) as the main symptoms.
However, 80% of patients required ventilatory support, much more than COVID-19 patients, which is the higher mortality of MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In patients with SARS, fever (99% to 100%), dry cough (29% to 75%), dyspnea (40% to 42%), diarrhea (20% to 25%) and sore throat (13% to 25%) were shown to be the main symptoms, and ventilatory support was required for approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
Until February 14, COVID-19 mortality was 2%, when confirmed cases in the world reached 66,576.
Comparatively, SARS mortality by November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a June 2012 demographic study, mortality was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
A more recent study reported that the baseline number of reproduction R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was up to 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI), 5.71 to 7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV ranged from 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV regarding their symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The figures above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater propagation capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than the latter two.
Therefore, it is a much greater challenge to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The appearance of symptoms in a group of people usually happens in the same family or in the same agglomeration or vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas, or contact with infected individuals or patients in the two weeks prior to the onset of symptoms.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus for more than two weeks without showing symptoms, and cured patients who have been discharged from hospitals can contract the virus again, which generates an alarm so that the quarantine time is prolonged.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (mainly lymphocytes) in the early stage.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell counts below 4 x 109/L including lymphocyte counts below 1 x 109/L, and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were detected in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
Enzyme and myoglobin levels in the muscles and liver were increased in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of D-dimer, a product of the degradation of fibrin present in the blood, was elevated, and the lymphocyte count showed a progressive reduction.
Abnormalities in the chest x-ray are present in most patients with COVID-19, and present bilateral irregular shadows or matte glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients generally developed atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis severely compromise the exchange of gases.
The dysfunction of type-I and type-II pneumocytes decreases the level of surfactant and increases surface tension, thereby reducing the ability of the lungs to expand, and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the most severe chest X-ray results usually correspond to the most severe form of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the desquamation of pneumotics, the formation of the hyaline membrane, the infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes and syncytial cells into the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS, and similar to the pathology of patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through the polymerase-reverse transcriptase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which became not only derived from RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological results is essential and indispensable to arrive at an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at 20 x 10-18 mol/L at 200 x 10-18 mol/L (10 to 100 copies per microliter input) using a complex measuring rod at less than one hour.
We hope that the new technique can drastically increase sensitivity and convenience, if verified in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new CoV, doctors can provide palliative treatment to COVID-19 patients at the best of their ability, while attempting a variety of therapies that have been used or previously proposed for the treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from cured patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even plasma from recovering patients was suggested as treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing against time to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs in the beginning and probably also attacks, to a lesser degree, other organs with ACE2 expression, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and organ failure are the main threats to patients and the main causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygenation therapy, high-flow oxygenation, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need to receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary alternative technique used for the treatment of severe cardiac or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and the protection of vital organ functions are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
The cytokine cascade is known to result from an exacerbated immune system reaction in patients with SARS and MERS.
The cytokine cascade is a form of systemic inflammatory response, characterized by the release of a number of cytokines, including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce the cells of the immune system to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine cascades, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, are being used to treat the cytokine cascade.
Other immunosuppression treatments for the cytokine cascade include modulation of the T-cell-targeted immune response; blocking of IFN-y, IL-1 and TNF; inhibition of JAK, blinatumomab; cytokine signaling suppressor 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
They can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, drastically affecting the prognosis.
However, short periods of corticosteroid treatment at low to moderate doses have been recommended for cautious use in severely ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time this article is written, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration with remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was found to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, initially intended for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other single-stranded RNA viruses, including the MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead has supplied the compound to China to conduct some tests on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are long overdue.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin were suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be closely monitored.
Plasma of cured patients and generation of antibodies
The collection of blood from patients who have cured themselves of a contagious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease, or to protect healthy individuals from contracting the disease has a long history.
In fact, cured patients usually have a relatively high level of antibodies in the blood against the pathogen.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (lg) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies, and they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who were cured of COVID-19, and was injected into 10 patients in severe condition.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, with reduced inflammation and viral loads, and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and elucidation are necessary in order to propose the use of the method on a large scale before the development of specific therapies.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-associated drawbacks should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially fatal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is great for treating patients in severe condition.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to combat a world-wide epidemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from cured patients and identify the genetic codes encoding effective antibodies or to screen for effective antibodies against essential proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can rapidly increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional Chinese Medicine, TCM, has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend heavily on a combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on TCM theories.
Most effective components remain unknown, or vague, as it is difficult to extract and verify these components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific and effective therapies for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the primary alternative treatments for patients with mild or moderate symptoms, or for patients who have recovered from severe stages of the disease.
For example, it has been found that capsules of Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen are effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The best cure rates for COVID-19 patients were seen in several provinces in China that used TCM in 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, which used TCM in only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, achieved the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is a difficult comparison, since many impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and co-workers published a comparative study between the exclusive treatment with Western medicine and the combined treatment of Western medicine with TCM.
It was found that the times needed for recovery of body temperature, for the disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization were considerably shorter in the group treated by Western medicine and TCM than only in the group treated by Western medicine.
The rate of worsening of symptoms (mild to severe) was considerably lower for the group treated by Western medicine and TCM than for the group treated only by Western medicine (7.4% versus 46.2%), and mortality was lower in the group treated by Western medicine and TCM than in the group treated only by Western medicine (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of TCM are still awaiting more properly controlled tests at larger scales and at more centers.
It would also be useful to characterize the mechanisms of action and explain the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations, if possible.
Patients confirmed with COVID-19 or suspected of the disease generally feel great fear of the highly contagious and potentially fatal disease, and people in quarantine also feel bored, lonely and irritated.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can increase anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early phase of the SARS epidemic, several psychiatric morbidities including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, psychosis symptoms, delirium and even suicidal tendencies have been reported.
Mandatory contact tracking and quarantine, as part of the public health system’s actions against the COVID-19 epidemic, can make people more anxious, and they may feel guilty about the effects of contagion, quarantine, and stigma imposed on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, to people suspected of the disease and to people who have had contact with them, as well as to the general population in need.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid direct contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential to disrupt the chain of transmission from animal reservoirs and infected people to susceptible hosts, and are generally complementary to antiviral treatment in controlling epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Initiatives have been taken to develop S-protein-based vaccines to generate potent and long-lasting neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines were evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these vaccine candidates in older individuals and the models of lethal challenge and their protection against zoonotic virus infection have yet to be determined before the start of a clinical trial.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS disappeared 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
On the other hand, sporadic cases and outbreaks of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and essential task for the control of the current epidemic.
However, it is a challenge to overcome the difficulty, due to the long period (18 months, on average) necessary for the development of a vaccine and the variations in the dynamics of CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to manifest its full clinical evolution, reaching thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients gradually recover without sequelae.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, building a prognostic model for the disease is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in resource-poor areas.
Based on clinical studies reported to date, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which also applies to COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects people between 30 and 65 years of age, with 47.7% of patients over 50 years of age, in a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients who required intensive treatment were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older than patients who did not require intensive treatment (mean age 66 years versus 51 years), suggesting that age is a prognostic factor for the health outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 men and 0.27/100,000 women), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive treatment are more likely to suffer an acute cardiac injury or arrhythmia.
Cardiac episodes were the leading cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also bind to ECA2-positive cholangiocytes, which may lead to liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to note that age and underlying diseases have strong correlations and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed as a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
The correlation of the level of CRP with the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 was also proposed.
In addition, elevated lactate hydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also help in predicting the outcome.
These enzymes are expressively present in various organs, mainly in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional markers for heart or liver dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: chest x-ray and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other issues for the prediction of COVID-19 outcomes/complications.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as adjunct therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Given that a high dosage of corticosteroids was widely used in patients with severe SARS, many survivors suffered from avascular osteonecrosis, with permanent disability and low quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at a low dosage and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Psychological stress: as described above, during the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from high stress, as they go through long periods of quarantine and uncertainties, and witness the death of loved ones and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychological counseling and long-lasting support to help these patients recover from stress and resume a normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics from the characteristics of SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and does not cause symptoms in the early stage of infection (or causes only mild symptoms), similar to other CoVs that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients infected in the early stage or incubation period can produce a large amount of the virus during their daily activities, causing great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, it was considered that transmission of SARS-CoV occurs when patients are seriously ill, with most transmissions not occurring in the initial phase.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious and difficult to control than the SARS epidemic.
Great efforts are currently being made in China, including the confinement of Wuhan and neighboring cities, and the continued quarantine of almost the entire population, in hopes of disrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions have drastically affected the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the remission of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the epidemic will end by March, and the phase of deceleration will last between 3 and 4 months.
However, other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be substantially more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., established a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 can infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the throat and middle cornet smears of patients who recovered and were discharged from the hospital in the previous 2 weeks, indicating that the newly identified virus may become a cyclic flu-like episode.
However, promising indications have occurred in China based on the decline in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies may be working.
Ebola was originally predicted to cause up to a million cases, with half a million deaths.
However, with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was finally kept under control.
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2, in the same way as SARS-CoV, may become weaker in terms of its infectivity and, at some point, become a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with that of SARS and MERS can be found below (Fig. (Fig.55)).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible by coughing and sneezing and possibly by direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.
The virus has also been found in feces, which generates a new possibility: that of oral-fecal transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were possibly caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with underlying diseases and 40 health professionals.
Therefore, greater caution should be taken to protect people, especially health professionals, social workers, family members, co-workers, and people in direct contact with infected patients or individuals.
The first line of defense that can be used to decrease the risk of infection is the use of face masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 breathing masks (series #1860s) helps control the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent fluid droplets from a potentially infected individual from being carried in the air or sticking to the surfaces of objects, where they can infect other people.
However, only the N95 masks (series #1860s) protect against inhalation of virions from 10 nm to 80 nm in size, with only 5% of the virions being able to fully penetrate it; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV, and the two are approximately 85 nm in size.
Since the particles can penetrate up to five surgical masks together, healthcare professionals in direct contact with patients should wear N95 masks (series # 1860s), but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health professionals should wear insulating bathrobes to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses also infect an individual through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2, although he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus could have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare professionals should also wear transparent facial protectors or protective glasses when caring for patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than normal, try to stay at home in isolation, and limit contact with potentially infected people.
One meter is considered a proper distance to keep away from a patient.
These actions are effective methods to decrease the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a new virus for humans, its high homology to SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should have caused a major alert for China, based on its recent history with the SARS epidemic in 2003.
However, only on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control reassured citizens, saying that the new virus has a low contagion rate and limited reproductive capacity among humans, and that it was not difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message made people more relaxed, especially when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical period for containing the disease in Wuhan on a minimal scale was lost.
Disease control agencies in China can take advantage of this hard lesson and make crucial improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should: (1) be more cautious in making public pronouncements, since everything they say is periodically absorbed by citizens and can influence their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from hospitals, rather than waiting for formal communications from doctors and authorities; (3) be more restrictive in order to contain a potential epidemic in its early stages and to simulate the public’s and the public’s comfort.
The COVID-19 epidemic caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread across China and nearly 50 other countries around the world at the time of writing.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV, and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 epidemic has generated a sense of return from SARS.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for the containment of the epidemic and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people, and men more than women, and the severity and mortality rate are also higher in older people than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus when they have no symptoms, while patients with SARS usually transmit it when they are seriously ill, which leads to greater difficulty in containing the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains, in part, why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and affects more regions than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, cured patients may receive a positive test for the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of spreading the virus.
Given the rapid progress in COVID-19 research, several crucial issues still need to be resolved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homolog has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like Bat CoVs, we cannot yet conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originates from bats.
What animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, the bat, say, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to questions 1 and 2, we will not be able to cut off the transmission efficiently, and the epidemic may recur at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical assays have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ECA2, how exactly does the virus enter respiratory cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells with ECA2 expression in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How is the virus evolving genetically during transmission between humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, disappear like SARS, or will it have seasonal recurrence like the flu?
It is essential, but it may take some time to search for answers to the above questions and to so many others.
However, regardless of the efforts required, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have driven the coevolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause a mild illness, such as a common cold.
The epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed what was thought about CoVs and revealed how lethal and devastating an HCoV infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 brought CoVS to the fore again and surprised everyone with its high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to its brother SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is zoonotic, and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs is of enormous utility.
Most HCoVs originated from bats, in which they are non-pathogenic.
The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of diseases in humans.
Investigation of CoV host interactions in animals may also provide important information on the pathogenesis of CoV in humans.
In this study, we present an overview of the existing information on the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission.
An important analysis is that of comparing and contrasting different HCoVs from a perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination.
The current epidemic of CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for effective transition between hosts and the implications of virus evolution on disease severity are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the Coronaviridae family, which comprises a group of encapsulated viruses of positive polarity and single-stranded RNA.
These viruses that have the largest genome, between 26 and 32 kilobases, among RNA viruses have been called "CoVs" due to their crown morphology when observed under electron microscope.
As for structure, CoVs have unsegmented genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two overlapping open reading structures (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab replicate polyproteins.
The polyproteins are transformed again and generate 16 non-structural proteins, designated nsp1 to nsp16.
The remaining portion of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
Some accessory proteins of specific lineage are also encoded by different CoV lineages.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alphaCoV, betaCoV, gammaCoV, and deltaCoV), among which the betaCoV genus contains the majority of HCoVs and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents serve as a genetic source for most alphaCoVs and betaCoVs, while birds are the main reservoir of gammaCoVs and deltaCoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have constantly crossed species barriers, and some have become relevant human pathogens.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alphaCoVs.
The other five betaCoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
The HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 viruses often cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in a relatively larger number of patients, with a high chance of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the coryza of patients with the common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through comprehensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, the concept that HCoV infection is generally harmless was widely accepted until the SARS epidemic.
The SARS epidemic that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating today and has infected more than 8,000 people, with a confirmed case-related gross mortality rate of approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic has resulted in a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new 2019 HCoV (2019-nCoV), which was later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the current 2019 coronavirus disease epidemic (COVID-19), which took more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people by March 3, 2020.
The alarm is sounding, and the world needs to prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origin in bats, mice or domestic animals.
Multiple lines of evidence corroborate the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats, where viruses are well adapted and not pathogenic, but demonstrate great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic presents enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for China and the rest of the world.
Tracking the zoonotic origins of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving force, and restrictive factors of the virus’ migration to other species.
This can also guide and facilitate the search for SARS-CoV-2 reservoir, intermediate and amplifier hosts, with important implications in the future prevention of viral migration between species.
In this article, we present an overview of zoonotic origins, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common theme that parental HCoV viruses are generally non-pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts, but become pathogenic after interspecies transmission to a new host.
We also reviewed the evolution trend of HCoV, in which increased transmissibility is usually accompanied by decreased pathogenicity.
The outcome of the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the first isolation of HCoV-229E strain B814 from the coryza of patients who contracted the common cold, different CoVs had been isolated in several infected animals, including turkey, mouse, cow, pig, cat, and dog.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of HCoV in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and was subsequently adapted for growth in WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had common cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, malaise and sore throat, with fever and cough present in 10% to 20% of cases.
Subsequently, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage in the brains of lactating mice.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection appear similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which are symptomatically indistinguishable from infection by other respiratory tract pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed globally, and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than a week, accompanied by the disease for approximately 2 weeks.
According to a study of human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E developed a common mild cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients exhibited severe lower respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", was the first documented pandemic caused by HCoV in human history, and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV discovered.
The first case of SARS dates back to 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, spreading across several countries and continents.
With the exception of "superscatterers", it was estimated that each infected person can contaminate approximately two others, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days, and with the appearance of the peak of viral load on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially present with myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by subsequent symptoms of dyspnea, cough and respiratory discomfort.
Lymphopenia, liver dysfunction, and elevated creatine kinase are common SARS abnormalities in laboratory tests.
Diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and increased macrophage count are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20% to 30% of patients require, at some point, intensive treatment and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidneys, can also be affected in these severe cases, usually with the occurrence of a cytokine cascade, which can be lethal, especially in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated in a lung biopsy from a relative of patient zero traveling from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to research on HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found that the virus was prevalent in young children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The symptoms of choryza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis are common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal specimen of an 8-month-old baby suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is dispersed throughout the world.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its peak incidence occurs in winter, spring and early summer.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, it was reported that HCoV-HKU1 was associated with exacerbation of acute asthma.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
All four of these community-acquired HCoVs have adapted well to humans and are generally less likely to mutate and cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported as causing severe lower respiratory tract infection in China.
In general, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to be transmitted efficiently and to sustain themselves continuously in humans, they also become less virulent and less pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most laboratory-confirmed cases originate in the Middle East, imported cases with occasional secondary spread to close contacts have been reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also develop acute renal failure, which is therefore quite peculiar for MERS, among diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported with a high confirmed case-related mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses of human knowledge.
From half to the end of December 2019, groups of patients with pneumonia, which were known retrospectively to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing epidemic of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a Public Health Emergency of International Importance and has also named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a confirmed case-related gross mortality rate of 3.4%.
It is noted that the lethality related to confirmed cases in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while the lethality outside that city is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, as do SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with the presence of fever, cough, and dyspnea.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high homology of 82% in the nucleotide sequence, they cluster into different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but is more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, and they may contribute to the rapid spread of the virus worldwide.
Comparison and contrast of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs reveal similarities and differences of great relevance.
First, the incubation period and the duration of the evolution of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this sense, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between the severity of SARS-CoV and the severity of the four community-acquired HCoVs (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection presents characteristics that are most observed during infection with community-acquired HCoVs, including the presence of non-specific, mild symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be observed, as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns in both community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, it must be confirmed whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passing to humans, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in faecal samples.
It still needs to be clarified in future studies whether oro-fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances.
It is also of great interest to find out if SARS-CoV-2 can exhibit seasonality, as in the cases of community-acquired HCoVs.
In any case, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable propagation after its passage to humans, will influence the outcome of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
All community-acquired HCoVs that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, the two could be survivors of ancient HCoV pandemics.
HCoVs that cause serious illness in humans and people who develop serious illnesses of HCoVs have been eliminated.
For this to happen, HCoVs need to replicate in humans to a sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that neutralize restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic lasts, the more people will be infected, and the greater the chance that the virus will adapt to humans.
If the adaptation is adequate, its transmission to humans would be difficult to control with quarantine or other infection control measures.
For several years, the four community-acquired CoVs have been circulating in human populations, causing common colds in immunocompetent individuals.
These viruses don't need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV did not adapt well to humans, and their transmission between humans cannot be sustained.
They need to maintain and propagate in their zoonotic reservoirs and seize the chance to migrate to susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.
It is highly transmissible, just like community-acquired HCoVs, at least so far.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
It has yet to be discovered whether it will fully adapt to human beings and circulate among us without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it would be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary hosts, natural hosts, reservoirs, intermediates and amplifiers of HCoVs.
An animal serves as the evolutionary host of an HCoV if it harbors a direct relationship ancestor, sharing high homology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and not pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, a reservoir host houses the HCoV continuously and lastingly.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of HCoV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCoV is newly introduced to an intermediate host shortly before or near its introduction to humans, it does not suitably adapt to the new host, and is generally pathogenic.
This intermediate host can serve as the zoonotic source of human infection and play the role of an amplifier host, allowing the virus to transiently replicate and then transmit it to humans and increase the scale of human infection.
An HCoV may have the infection stopped if it cannot sustain its transmission in the intermediate host.
In contrast, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data revealed that patient zero of SARS had a history of contact with game animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence investigations indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to the general population.
Masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and a guachinim dog in live animal markets were initially identified as carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses.
The identification was indirectly corroborated by the fact that no other SARS was reported after the slaughter of all the civets in the markets.
However, it has been reported that wild masquerade palm civets or farms without exposure to live animal markets were highly negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that masquerade palm civets could only be the amplifying intermediate host, but not the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It is noted that 80% of the different animals in the markets in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies; the possibility that several species of small mammals can serve as SARS-CoV amplifier intermediate hosts cannot be excluded.
All of these animals appear to be terminal hosts of SARS-CoV.
The subsequent search for the SARS-CoV natural animal host revealed a closely related bat CoV, named SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in the Chinese horseshoe bat.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genomic sequence.
These and other bat CoVs share 88% to 92% homology with SARS-CoV in the nucleotide sequence.
These studies formed the basis for the new concept that bats are the host of emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in bats, but no CoV, with the exception of the so-called WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
The angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) in humans is known to be the SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 derived from fecal samples of bats has been shown to use ECA2 from bats, civets and humans as a receptor for entry into cells.
It is intriguing that serum from convalescent SARS patients was able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the ancestor with the closest relationship to SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parent virus of SARS-CoV, and that bats are not the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis groups MERS-CoV into the same group as Bat CoV-HKU4 and Bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
RNA polymerase sequences dependent on MERS-CoV RNA are phylogenetically closer to the homologs in betaCoVs of bats identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative, Bat CoV-HKU25, share only 87% homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, bats may not be the immediate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that camels are seropositive for MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, in the same way as camels from the Middle East in several African countries.
The live MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, was isolated from dromedary nasal swabs, increasing evidence that camels serve as the legitimate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that the symptoms usually mild, but with massive transmission of the virus, were observed in camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV.
It is remarkable that infected camels transmit the viruses not only by the respiratory route, but also by the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of virus transmission in bats.
However, answers are still lacking, since many confirmed cases of MERS do not have a history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, which can be plausibly attributed to transmission between people or to transmission routes involving unidentified animal species that harbor MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with a bat CoV RaTG13 isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the divergence in sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too great to attribute a parental relationship.
That is, bats may not be the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV-2, unless near-identical bat CoVs are discovered in the future.
It is assumed that SARS-CoV-2 intermediate animal hosts should be configured among wild species sold and slaughtered at the Huanan Sea Fruit Wholesale Market, to which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 have been associated, indicating a probable event of transmission from animals to humans.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of small endangered mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) could also harbor ancestral SARS-CoV-2-related betaCoVs.
These new pangolin CoV genomes share 85% to 92% homology in the nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are also directly related to RaTG13, with about 90% identity at the nucleotide sequence level.
They cluster in SARS-CoV-2-like virus underlines in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor-binding domain (DLR) with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% identity in the amino acid sequence.
In enormous contrast, the DLRs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, although they exhibit a high degree of sequential homology throughout the genome.
A recent study of sick pangolins also reported the detection of viral consensus sequences of lung samples, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of configuration and manual curation to generate a partial genomic sequence, corresponding to about 86.3% of the viral genome in total size.
We cannot exclude the possibility that the pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, at present, there is no evidence to confirm the direct origin of pangolin SARS-CoV-2 due to divergence in the sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related betaCoVs.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even smaller than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-2-related betaCoVs of pangolins.
The evolutionary route of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals has yet to be clarified.
While the highest sequential homology was found in the DLRs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, the SARS-CoV-2-related betaCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest broad genomic sequential homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the DLRs of pangolin betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 stems from convergent evolution mediated by selectivity.
A counterargument is in favor of recombination between the betaCoV of SARS-CoV-2-related pangolins and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is quite present in betaCoVs.
The immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains under investigation.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses has also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat CoVs, while parental HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses were discovered in rodents.
It was reported that a bat CoV called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in the North American tricolor bat had a direct relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, and there is also a suspicion that camelids are their intermediate hosts.
For clarity, current knowledge about the animal origins of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for interspecies transmission events of HCoVs throughout history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species and infected humans from domestic animals around 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The interspecies transmission history of HCoV-229E is less clear.
AlphaCoVs of bats closely related to HCoV-229E have been discovered.
Among them, there is an alphaCoV of alpacas.
Several lines of evidence corroborate the direct transmission of the bat virus to humans.
First, humans, but not alpacas, may have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
In contrast, humans have direct contact with the alpacas.
Second, the HCoV-229E-related bat alphaCoVs are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while the alpacas alphaCoV caused an epidemic of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alphaCoV from alpacas was not found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility cannot be ruled out that alpacas obtain HCoV-229E-related alphaCoV from humans.
In fact, bats are the direct source of pathogenic viruses for humans, including the rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, while alphaCoVs serve as the genetic pool of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries can serve as intermediate hosts that transmit the viruses to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to dromedaries and from dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known in its initial identification and has been corroborated by subsequent results.
It is obvious that bats provide a rich pool of viral species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, high-density colonies, close social interaction, and high flight capacity are all favorable conditions for bats to be the ideal “viral propagator.”
On the other hand, the introduction of MERS-CoV in dromedaries dates back decades.
It is well adapted to these camels, and migrated from an intermediate host to a natural and stable reservoir host.
MERS-CoV causes a mild disease and sustains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is an accident, and humans remain terminal hosts of MERS-CoV, since its transmission cannot be sustained.
In contrast to the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
Specifically, pangolin betaCoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be a terminal host for SARS-CoV-2-related betaCoVs, similar to civets, in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for the interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans need to be confirmed or ruled out in future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share the ecological niche with bats through slaughter or coal mines.
Second, pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifier hosts, in which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus through slaughter and consumption of game meat.
It is possible that many mammals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Research on antibodies produced from domestic and wild animals is needed.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is still active.
In addition to the different types of animal hosts, three main factors in the virus are important in facilitating CoVs to cross species barriers.
First, its relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of CoVs can be considered "moderate" to "high" with an average replacement rate of approximately 10-4 substitutions per year, per site, depending on the stage of adaptation of CoV to new hosts.
CoVs have revision mechanism exoribonuclease, the exclusion of which results in excessively high mutability and attenuation, or even unfeasibility.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analog remdesivir suppresses CoV replication by inhibiting this exorribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rates of CoVs are almost a million times higher than those of their hosts.
Moreover, the mutation rate is usually high when the CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is low, apparently, which suggests its higher level of adaptation to humans.
Presumably, he has already adapted to another host that maintains contact with humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedaries.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that a genetic change would quickly render vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Secondly, the large genome of RNA in CoVs exerts an extra plasticity in genome modification for mutations and recombinations, thus increasing the probability of interspecies coevolution, which is advantageous for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions become appropriate.
This is corroborated by the abundance of unique reading frames and encoded protein functions relative to the last three inches of the genome end.
Third, CoVs exchange models randomly and frequently during RNA replication through a unique "copy choice" mechanism.
In a host that serves as a mixing container, ribbon exchange often occurs during transcription of CoV RNA.
Highly homologous and subgenomic long RNAs can recombine to generate new CoVs.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs, such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor influencing interspecies transmission.
Here, SARS-CoV recombination is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Based on the comparative analysis between SARS-CoV isolates from humans and civets, it is believed that SARS-CoV undergoes a rapid adaptation in different hosts, mainly with mutations in the DLR of the S protein.
In general, the DLR in the S protein of a CoV interacts with the cellular receptor and is intensely selected by the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, DLR is at amino acids 318<0xC2><0xB0> to 510<0xC2><0xB0> in the S1 fragment, which binds to human ECA2 as well as its co-receptors for viral entry.
The SARS-CoV DLR is capable of recognizing the ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bats, civets, mice and guaxin dogs, enabling interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, it was observed that only six amino acid residues were different from human and civet viral isolates in the DLR, and four of them are located in the receptor binding motif for interaction with the ECA2 receptor.
The SARS-CoV of the civets has K479N and S487T mutations in their DLR, which could increase the affinity of the spike protein interaction with the human ECA2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be critical for viral adaptation in humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein implies that the binding affinity of its S protein to human ECA2 could have been altered.
In fact, a study with electronic cryomicroscopy indicates an affinity 10 to 20 times greater than between human ECA2 and SARS-CoV protein S.
It will also be useful to determine whether any other co-receptors may be needed for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
It is intriguing that HCoV-NL63 also binds to ECA2, but with a different part of protein S.
There are several other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and sialic acid 9-O-acetylated for HCoV-OC43.
They could also account for the effective adaptation of these CoVs in humans after interspecies transmission from their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of interspecies transmission of HCoVs is also governed by other factors of restriction and dependence on the host.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and natural reservoir hosts of HCoVs such as bats, dromedaries and rodents could constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoVs need to usurp host-dependent factors and subvert host-restriction factors for effective interspecies transmission.
In this sense, the molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction still need to be identified and characterized.
A non-tendentious screening with genome-wide range of host dependence and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using modern CRISPR technology can yield good results.
Emergence of new HCoVs: back to zero
The diversity of bat CoVs provides ample possibilities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs serve as a genetic pool of HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of novel protein coding genes has the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Among the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is believed to be important in its adaptation to humans, since SARS-CoV-related bat viruses have been isolated, but they have been found to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
A nucleotide 29 exclusion characteristic of SARS-CoVs was discovered in isolated strains early in the human epidemic.
The exclusion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host alternation.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with alphaCoVs and gammaCoVs, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombination sites were also identified in nsp9, mostly in nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it was shown that the epidemic MERS-CoV went through recombination events between different strains, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events were also observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs recombine with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection may contribute to undesired changes in viral genomes, likely resulting from relief of selection pressure exerted on viruses, such as pressure from the host immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a long ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain due to the exclusion of two nucleotides.
While intact ORF4 can be observed in HCoV-229E-related bat and camel viruses, alphaCoV from alpacas exhibits a simple insertion of nucleotides, resulting in a change in frames.
Last but not least, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by selection pressure on their reservoir hosts.
Absence of symptoms or only mild symptoms were detected in bats when infected with CoVs, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
Bats are likely to be well adapted to CoVs anatomically and physiologically.
For example, defects in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural exterminator cells in bats is suppressed due to the adaptation of the natural exterminator cell inhibitor receptor NKG2/CD94, and the low degree of expression of class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex.
Moreover, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the high metabolic activity of bats can both suppress the replication of CoV and affect the review by exorribonuclease, thus providing the selective pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic strains of CoV could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of proteins or novel protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic, or cause at most mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as bats and camels.
They replicate immensely without triggering a high immune response from the host.
This document explains the discovery of asymptomatic carriers and the cause of severe cases in human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to overactivation of the immune response and cytokine cascade, in which the greater the immune response, the more severe the damage to the lungs.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was disconnected from CoV replication.
The same strategy of shutting down the immune response could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is specifically strong in bats.
Therefore, administration of interferon type I at the initial stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in bats is deficient.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same principles by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While bat betaCoV shares 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is a bat CoV that shares 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been found that civets and other animals in the markets harbor viruses identical to SARS-CoV, intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Pangolin betaCoVs, with high homology to SARS-CoV-2, have been discovered, indicating that pangolins may serve as one of the intermediate hosts, or pangolin betaCoVs may contribute genetic fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although the questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is accidentally or intentionally produced by man.
CoVs have returned to worldwide attention due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals drastically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of HCoVs in human-to-human transmission.
Widespread evidence shows that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate from the bat and are transmitted to people through intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infection originated from contact between humans and civets in markets, the closure of wet markets and the slaughter of civets in those markets could have put an end to the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, in the face of the discovery of multiple lines of betaCoVs from pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, it should still be clarified in future studies whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals, and how it is transmitted.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in dromedaries for a long time.
These camels serve as an important means of transportation, and are an essential source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local community.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels for MERS control, as was done in the wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To halt recurrent MERS epidemics, a comprehensive approach must be taken to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may emerge and cause epidemics.
A variety of zoonotic CoVs circulate in the wild.
Specifically, the CoVs of bats with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There are several possibilities for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and recombine, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the SARS, MERS and COVID-19 crisis, a better response and preparedness plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They stay in their natural reservoirs until there is a chance of migration to another species.
Although bats have many characteristics that favor the spread of the virus, the chance that people are in contact with bats and other wild species can be minimized if people are taught to stay away from them.
Continuous surveillance in mammals is necessary for a better understanding of the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is for people to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces of the SARS-CoV-2 zoonotic origin puzzle are still missing.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it is important to find out under what circumstances bats and pangolins might share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in transmission to humans, it should be determined how people come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal plays the role of the true intermediate host, it needs to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Finally, since several mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be performed.
If it is a bat, pangolin, or other mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or its near-identical parental viruses are expected to be identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Continued research in this area will elucidate the evolutionary route of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria of "suspect case" and "confirmed case" of COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team published a Quick Guide to Diagnosis and Treatment of the 2019 New Coronavirus Infection (2019-nCoV). This guide conveys our experience and constitutes a good reference for combating this global pandemic.
However, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is new. Our understanding and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the constant discoveries of research and experiences in clinical practice; as a result, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we respond to a commentary on our guide and provide the latest diagnostic criteria of "suspected case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guides (seventh version) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is now officially referred to as the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and the virus is referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick guideline published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It has attracted excellent attention since publication.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease. Our understanding and knowledge gradually increase based on the constant discoveries of research and experiences in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, the COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guides published by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020 have a total of seven editions with substantial changes in context in some.
Our guide has now received a comment from Zhou et al., who presented a simple score proposal based on their clinical experience.
This work has added new evidence to our guide and also makes valuable references to this worldwide pandemic.
We endorse your significant work and express our gratitude.
However, their work also needs updating according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guides (seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the suspected case, it is necessary to combine an item of the elements of epidemiological history with two items of clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or it is necessary to comply with three items of clinical manifestations, if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residency in the city of Wuhan and in nearby areas, etc. cases where cases of COVID-19 were reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from the city of Wuhan or nearby areas.
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with diagnostic imaging capabilities of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count exhibiting normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte count at the initial stage of symptom onset.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on a suspected case with any of the following serological or pathogenic phase-equals: (1) PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) complete viral genome sequencing exhibiting high homogeneity with respect to the new known coronaviruses; (3) positive for the IgM and IgG antibodies specific for SARS-CoV-2 or higher for SARS-positive antibody.
We can note that real-time PCR examination for nucleic acid in blood or respiratory tract samples was added to the second and third editions (on January 18 and 22, 2020, respectively).
Pathogenic blood sample detection was added to the fourth and fifth editions (January 27, 2020 and February 8, 2020, respectively), and serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These modifications are based on the continuous work of researchers in the search for an ideal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis and respiratory tract samples, including blood sampling, which increased the availability of different specimens and helped to bring the positive result of specific antibodies to the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is more and more evidence that reminds us to pay attention to atypical symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the flowchart of Zhou et al. should be updated, as it classifies the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system also needs to be verified in more studies and clinical practices.
In conclusion, we expect more direct evidence to emerge and ask readers to provide their feedback.
For the diagnosis of “suspect case” and “confirmed case”, we suggest that you check and obey the latest guidelines of your home countries.
Our team will also timely update our guide to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, higher daily number
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 on the day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a day due to the virus.
The Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of confirmed cases recorded included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases remaining at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online newscast, IEDCR director Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora said the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years old, two were between 51 and 60 years old and one was between 41 and 50 years old.
She also said two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a COVID-19 pandemic on March 11.
A hospital officer told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video statement, the Bengali minister of road transport and bridges Obaidul Quader said that public transport would be paralyzed for longer than originally planned, until next Saturday.
This public transport shutdown began on March 26 and was planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of essential products (medical products, fuel and food) was still allowed.
The first incidents of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded on March 8 in two people who returned from Italy and also in the wife of one of them.
By March 19, the three had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 exceeds one million infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections worldwide exceeded one million, data from Johns Hopkins University said.
At least 52,000 deaths were linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
This milestone came on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infections and Zambia had its first virus-related death.
North Korea said as of Thursday it was one of the few remaining countries free of coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization has reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the 24 hours before 10 a.m. on Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been recorded, linked to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S. caused by coronavirus infections on Wednesday.
Around the world, countries have announced more stringent measures to inhibit the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the total blockade of the city until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin declared that Russians would continue to be remunerated without attending work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the national state of emergency by 15 days. The vote was approved by 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended the duration of the curfew to the entire day in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Previously, this duration was only from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to implement curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended the order to stay home until May 1.
Stores in Australia reduce toilet paper limits per transaction
On Saturday and Sunday evening, Australian retail chains Woolworths and Coles reduced restrictions on buying toilet paper, respectively, to two packages and one package per transaction at all stores in the country.
On Monday, ALDI also implemented a one-pack limit.
These limitations were communicated by messages in the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the networks.
Out of fear of COVID-19, buyers were allegedly stockpiling in case there was a need to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited purchases of toilet paper with home delivery to one package per order.
These changes came after the previous restriction of four packets per transaction implemented by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in its March 8 press release, said that even with the four-package restriction, “many stores are still running out of stock in less than an hour after delivery” and called the demand “unprecedented,” while ALDI called it “unexpected” in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
Sales had a “sharp increase” last week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
The Costco store in Canberra also limited the amount allowed to two packages last week.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered extra stock, while ALDI made stocks available in advance of a promotion planned for Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retail Association, said retailers are trying to increase inventories, but that local board restrictions on the frequency of truck deliveries make this difficult.
It expects high production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early release of the stock, some stores will not be able to hold Wednesday’s promotion.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail specialist at Queensland University of Technology, said stores replenish inventory every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a bulky item with low numbers in stock in terms of quantity, and that, when exhausted, leaves many empty spaces on the shelves, increasing the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths are of the opinion that if there was an abundant amount on the shelves, if products like toilet rolls and antiseptics could be [purchased] and were there in quantities, you would probably reduce the panic, Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper maker Who Gives a Crap said on Wednesday they would run out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which produces Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which produces Sorbent, emphasized that they were working 24/7 to maintain supply, according to News.com.au.
Real estate website domain.com reported that some real estate sellers were offering free toilet paper to early bidders in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were being held with buyers going on holiday over the extended Labor Day weekend.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a Darwin daily printout, included an eight-page insert intended to be trimmed and used as toilet paper.
Initially, stores were reluctant to impose restrictions, according to an ABC Australia report on March 3 in which they said they had no plans to implement restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, such as masks, antiseptics, dry products, hand soaps and flour.
As in Australia, on Sunday night, the British online supermarket Ocado limited purchases of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization declares COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the current outbreak of COVID-19 — the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus — to be a pandemic.
While the word “pandemic” indicates only the degree of spread of a disease, not how dangerous the specific cases are, the WHO emphasized the need to push governments to take action:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries are able to detect, test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize the population for a response, said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
We are very concerned about alarming levels of spread and severity and alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is an “unprecedented” pandemic.
In comments published by CNN in February, he stated that “outside influenza, no other respiratory viruses have been monitored from the onset to continued global spread.”
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar position, stating that "we had never seen a pandemic initiated by a coronavirus."
“We’ve never seen a pandemic that could be controlled at the same time.”
The new pandemic status follows the WHO decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said the outbreak would “in short, get worse.”
On Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is a continuing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, was declared an international public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020, and recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases had been reported in 210 countries and territories, with approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The mortality rate is estimated to be 4% in China, while globally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is approximately five days, but can vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended prevention measures include washing hands, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping distance from people, and monitoring and isolating people suspected of infection.
Authorities around the world responded with the implementation of travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk controls and the closure of establishments.
The pandemic has caused a severe global socioeconomic disruption, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages of supplies exacerbated by panic-triggered purchases.
Schools and universities have closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world’s student population.
Disinformation about the virus has spread online and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, people with descent and appearance from East and Southeast Asia and other people from areas with significant cases of the virus.
Due to reduced travel and heavy industry closures, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported a group of cases of pneumonia from unknown cause on December 31, 2019, and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
In large part, the cases were linked to the Huanan seafood wholesale market and therefore the virus is believed to have zoonotic origin.
The virus causing the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a recently discovered virus that is closely linked to bat, pangolin and SARS-CoV coronaviruses. The first person with known symptoms became ill on December 1, 2019 and had no visible connections to the later group of the seafood market.
Of the initial group of cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be market-related.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that one case pointed to November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old individual from Hubei province, who may have been the first. On February 26, 2020, the WHO reported that, as the new cases declared first decreased in China, but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases out of China had exceeded the number of new cases from China.
There may be significant underreporting of cases, especially among people with milder symptoms.
By February 26, relatively few cases had been reported among young people aged 19 or younger, accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. The UK’s top scientific advisor, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the British population would need to be infected until effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose tests have been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population and several countries adopted official policies not to test people with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, by January 23, it was estimated that 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected and that these undocumented infections were the source of infection in 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of people infected in Italy was considerably higher than the reported cases.
Initial estimates of the basic number of reproduction (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it may be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the time from the onset of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, with 14 days being the most common.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, approximately 80% of deaths occurred in people over the age of 60 and 75% had pre-existing medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The official COVID-19 pandemic death count typically refers to people who died and tested positive for COVID, according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 can be much higher, since it may not include people who died without having taken the test, for example, who died at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy showed that the additional number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death count by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that “we know [the official death toll] is underestimated,” a statement corroborated by episodic reports of underreporting in the U.S. This underestimate often occurs in pandemics such as the H1N1 swine flu epidemic in 2009. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside China occurred on February 1, in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
On February 28, outside China, more than a dozen deaths had already been recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of March 13, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica. Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age, sex and general health. The fatality coefficient represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given range.
Based on statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the overall fatality coefficient is 6.0% (97.039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies according to the region.
In China, estimates of the fatality coefficient fell from 17.3% (in people with onset of symptoms between January 1–10, 2020) to 0.7% (for people with onset of symptoms after February 1, 2020). Other measures include the rate of lethality (CFR), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed who die due to a disease, and the rate of lethality of the infection (IF), which represents
These statistics are not static over time and follow an infection-specific population through case resolution.
Some scholars have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates that the infection-fatality rate for the pandemic overall is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper estimate of this range is compatible with the results of the first randomized test for COVID-19 in Germany and with a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on the CFR estimates.
The WHO says the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and maximum duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may change depending on the location.
Maciej Boni, of Pennsylvania State University, said: “Without proper control, infectious epidemics usually reach their peak and then go into decline when there are no more hosts available for the disease.
But it’s almost impossible to make any proper projection at the time about when this will happen.”
The Chinese government’s senior medical adviser, Zhong Nanshan, said it “may end by June” if all countries mobilize to follow WHO’s recommendations regarding measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "probably will remain in circulation for a year or two."
According to the Imperial College study, led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be needed “until a vaccine is available (potentially in 18 months or more).”
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus will disappear completely, as it is highly transmissible" and "that it could become a seasonal disease, reappearing every year."
The virulence of reappearance will depend on group immunity and the extent of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively nonspecific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretion (catarrh), loss of olfactory sensation, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea or cyanosis. The WHO states that approximately one in six people becomes seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists that emergency symptoms are difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty walking and face or lips with blue coloration. It is advised to seek medical help if these symptoms are present. The progression of the disease can cause severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic respiratory distress, if severe.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms, but with test results confirming the infection, so researchers recommend that those who have been in close contact with a person with confirmed infection be closely monitored and examined to rule out infection.
Chinese estimates of the ratio of asymptomatics range from some to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between the onset of infection and symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days, but is usually five days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimated fraction of people with COVID-19 who lost olfactory sensation was initially 30% and subsequently dropped to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still being determined.
It is believed that this disease is spread mainly by close contact and by small droplets produced during the act of coughing, sneezing or speaking, being the close contact considered 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that coughing without covering the mouth can cause droplets to reach 4.5 meters (15 feet) up to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some people have proposed that the virus can also be transmitted by droplets that remain for longer periods in the air, which may have been generated during a conversation. Breathing droplets can also be produced during exhalation, including when speaking, although the virus is not normally in suspension.
The droplets may land in the mouths and noses of nearby people or possibly be inhaled by the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause the nebulization of respiratory secretions, resulting in airborne spread.
Spread can also occur when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches their own eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there is concern that it may spread through the stool, the risk of this happening is believed to be low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of oro-fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although transmission may be possible before symptoms appear and at later stages of the disease.
There were positive tests for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms, suggesting that transmission is possible even before the development of significant symptoms.
There are only a few laboratory-confirmed reports of asymptomatic cases, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified in some countries during contact tracking investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person usually infects two to three other people. The virus survives from hours to days on surfaces.
Specifically, it was found that the virus is detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, for one day in cardboard and for up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have already tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can pass the virus to humans, however, British authorities advise washing hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to a set of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All of the features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus resemble those of related coronaviruses in their nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies by homemade soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely associated with the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to have zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically associated with the genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus (line B). Two strains of this same lineage are derived from bats.
It has 96% similarity, at the whole genome level, to other samples of coronavirus from bats (BatCoV RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid difference in certain parts of genome sequences between the pangolin virus and that of humans.
Comparing the entire genome so far has found, at most, 92% sharing of genetic material between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that pangolins are the intermediate host.
The virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed based on the symptoms, but the definitive confirmation is by reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or by computed tomography (CT).
A study done in Wuhan comparing rRT-PCR to CT suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive, although less specific, with many of its imaging characteristics coinciding with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that “CT is not used for screening or as a frontline test for the diagnosis of COVID-19.”
The WHO published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.
The test uses reverse transcription followed by reaction and polymerase chain (rRT-PCR) in real time.
The test can be done on respiratory or blood samples.
The results are usually available from a few hours to days.
Generally, this test is performed in nasopharyngeal smear, although throat smear is also used. Several laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, capable of detecting antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these had proven sufficiently accurate to be approved for widespread use.
A serological test developed by Cellex in the United States has been approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
The particularities of X-ray and computed tomography (CT) images of symptomatic people include asymmetric peripheral matt glass opacities and absence of pleural effusions.
The Italian Radiological Society is gathering an international online database of imaging results in confirmed cases.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, images without PCR confirmation are of limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the results of thoracic CT with those of PCR and showed that although the image is less specific to the infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a research tool in epidemic areas.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed for the detection of characteristics of images of the virus with X-rays and CT.
Strategies to prevent transmission of the disease include maintaining good personal hygiene in general, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands, coughing or sneezing on a tissue, and placing this tissue directly in a waste container.
Anyone who has ever been infected is advised to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distance measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Many governments have restricted or advised against non-essential travel to or from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
The virus, however, has reached the stage of community spread in vast regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities and that some community members do not know where or how they have been infected. Health professionals caring for individuals who may be infected are recommended to use standard precautions, contact precautions and eye protection. Contact tracking is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.
Governments’ use of location data from mobile phones for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement calling for limits on this type of surveillance.
Several mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Some misconceptions about how to prevent infection have circulated, such as rinsing the nose and gargling with mouthwashes, which has already proved ineffective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19. However, several organizations are working towards the development of one.
Washing your hands is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty. They should also wash their hands before eating and after blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by homemade soap, which breaks its protective cover.
The CDC also recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with a minimum volume of 60% alcohol when soap and water are not readily available.
The WHO recommends avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated with various solutions (within up to one minute of disinfectant exposure for a stainless steel surface), including 62–71% ethanol, 50–100% isopropyl alcohol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5% iodinepovidone.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that in case of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in a location, such as an office or daycare, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATMs used by sick people should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend covering your mouth and nose with a folded elbow or a tissue when coughing or sneezing, as well as discarding any tissues immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance of displacement of expiratory droplets when speaking, sneezing or coughing.
The WHO has published instructions on when and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “The use of masks can reduce people’s propensity to touch their faces, which is one of the biggest sources of infection without proper hand hygiene.”
The WHO has recommended the use of masks by healthy people only when they are at high risk, such as caregivers of people with COVID-19, although they also recognize that wearing masks can help people not touch their own face.
In several countries, the use of face masks by the general public has begun to be encouraged.
In the US, the CDC recommends the use of non-medical face mask made from cloth. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy people in general, especially when coming in close contact with another person (stay 1 meter or less away).
In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear a surgical mask when using public transport or when staying in crowded places.
Thailand’s health authorities are encouraging people to make cloth face masks at home and wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, it is forbidden to go out in public without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear a face mask when going out in public areas in order to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has demanded that anyone entering supermarkets should wear a face mask.
In Israel, all residents were asked to wear face masks in public.
Taiwan, which has produced 10 million masks a day since mid-March, has required passengers on trains and intercity buses to wear face masks as of April 1.
In Panama, it is mandatory to wear a face mask when going out on the street. At the same time, it was recommended to produce masks at home for those who can not buy.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves infection control actions aimed at slowing the transmission of the disease, by reducing close contact between individuals.
Methods include quarantines, travel restrictions, and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping malls.
Social distancing methods can be applied by everyone when staying at home, limiting their travels, avoiding crowded areas, using non-contact greetings and keeping distance from others.
At the moment, many governments are forcing or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the epidemic.
The maximum number of people gathered recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (if there is no knowledge of COVID-19 transmission in a region) to 50 people and then to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and compromised immune systems face increased risk of serious illnesses and physical complications, being advised by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in areas of community epidemic. At the end of March 2020, the WHO and other health agencies "replaced" the term
The use of the term "social distance" led to implications that social isolation was needed altogether rather than encouraging contact by other alternative means. Some authorities published sexual health guidelines during the pandemic.
These recommendations include having sex only with someone you live with who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home was recommended for those who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and for those who suspected that they were infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Many governments have required or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The most incisive self-quarantine instructions were issued for those in high-risk groups.
Individuals who may have been exposed to others with COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region with large-scale transmission were advised to do 14 days of self-quarantine from the time of the last possible exposure.
Strategies for controlling an outbreak are containment or suppression and reduction.
The containment is carried out in the preliminary stages of an outbreak and aims to track and isolate the infected, as well as present other infection control measures and vaccines that prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are made to reduce it: the measures taken now serve to slow the spread and reduce its adverse effects on the health system, as well as on the population.
Containment and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time, in combination.
Suppression demands more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic at a basic reproduction rate of less than 1. The management of an infectious disease outbreak, in part, has to do with trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic. We call this "flattening of the epidemic curve".
Thus, the risk of health services overload is reduced, giving more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Interventions that are not of a pharmaceutical nature and that can manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, the use of face masks and self-quarantine; community measures that aim at physical distance, such as the closure of schools and the cancellation of events that lead to agglomerations; community involvement, in order to stimulate acceptance and participation in this.
Other countries have taken various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea, for example, presented mass screening and localized quarantines. In addition, the government issued warnings about the movement of infected people.
In Singapore, the infected received financial support when they performed the self-quarantine and, for those who did not, severe fines were imposed.
In Taiwan, there has been an increase in the production of face masks and those stockpiling medical supplies have been punished. Simulations carried out in the United Kingdom and the United States show that the reduction (the slowing of the rate of contagion, without stopping the spread of the epidemic) and the suppression (i.e. the reversal of the growth of the epidemic) present great challenges.
Ideal reduction policies can reduce the peak demand for health services by 2/3 and deaths by half. Still, this would result in hundreds of thousands of deaths while overburdening health systems.
Suppression may be the best alternative, but it needs to be maintained as long as there is circulation of the virus by the human population or until there is the availability of a vaccine, if this occurs earlier. Otherwise, transmission occurs again as soon as the relaxation of the measures occurs.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic brings with it social and economic costs.
There is no approved antiviral drug that is specific to COVID-19. There are, however, efforts towards the development of drugs, which include the testing of existing drugs.
Using cold medications that don’t require a prescription, drinking plenty of fluids, and resting can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the case, the use of oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid insertion or respiratory aid may be necessary.
The use of steroids can worsen the condition.
Several compounds previously approved to treat other viral diseases are under investigation for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization has also stated that some "homemade and traditional" drugs can relieve the symptoms caused by the SARS-CoV-19 virus.
WHO describes increasing capacity and adapting health care to the needs brought by COVID-19 as key measures to combat the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, and the WHO office in Europe issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to shift, at various levels, their resources, including the concentration of available laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, the cancellation of non-mandatory procedures, and the separation and isolation of patients with positive COVID-19 testing.
There are several theories about the emergence of the first case (the so-called patient zero).
The first known case of the new coronavirus dates from December 1, 2019, in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in the region gradually increased.
These cases were largely linked to the wholesale market of Huanan seafood. The market also sold live animals, which led to the theory that the virus came from one of these animals. In other words, it was believed that it had a zoonotic origin. On December 26, a group of patients was observed and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian, at the Wuhan Provincial Hospital of Hubei. Dohan's Medical Center and the following day
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a “SARS-like coronavirus.”
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were scolded by police for spreading fake news, and another doctor, Ai Fen, was scolded by his superiors for raising the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, on December 31, made a statement to the population and informed the WHO.
Sufficient cases of pneumonia of unknown origin had already been reported to Wuhan health authorities to generate an investigation in early January. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days, approximately.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces in China, facilitated by the Chinese New Year migration and Wuhan being a transportation hub as well as a major rail connection point.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzen.
Later official data show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by January 20, 2020. On March 26, the United States surpassed China and Italy, with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. On April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died, and more than 364,000 recovered.
Approximately 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
As a result of the pandemic in Europe, many Schengen countries have restricted free movement and established border controls.
The reactions of the countries have included containment measures, such as quarantines (also known as home confinement orders 1, home containment orders or lockdown) and curfews. On April 2, about 300 million people (nearly 90% of the population) are confined in some way in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, and around 59 million people are confined in the Philippines.
As of March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were already in some form of lockdown, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later, about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was recorded in Wuhan on December 1, 2019. An unconfirmed report suggests an earlier case of November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of patients with pneumonia from unknown causes on December 26. Her hospital reported the Wuhan Jianghan Center for Disease Prevention and Control on December 27.
Initial genetic tests on December 27, 2019, in samples taken from patients indicated the presence of a coronavirus of the SARS type.
A communiqué to the population was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31.
The WHO was informed on the same day.
When these notifications occurred, Wuhan doctors were warned by police for “spreading rumors” about the outbreak.
China’s National Health Commission initially claimed there was no “clear evidence” of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, as a “people’s war,” to curb the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as "the largest quarantine in human history", a cordon sanitaire was announced on Jan. 23 to interrupt round trips to Wuhan, which was extended by 15 Hubei cities, reaching about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles was banned in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations on January 25 were canceled in several localities.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital, Leishenshan, was later built to serve more patients.
Along with newly built hospitals, China has converted 14 other Wuhan establishments into temporary hospitals, such as convention centers and stadiums. On January 26, the government launched more measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health statements for travelers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools across the country have also been closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macau have taken a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
Measures for remote work have been taken in many regions of the country.
Restrictions on travel were carried out in Hubei and outside of it.
Public transport was modified, and museums across China were temporarily closed.
Control of the movement of the public has been applied in several cities, and it has been estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) have gone through some sort of exit restriction. After the outbreak entered its global phase in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the "import" of the virus from other countries.
Beijing, for example, imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international travelers arriving in the city. On March 23, mainland China had only one case of domestic transmission in five days, in this case, through a traveler who returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of domestic transmission cases had basically been blocked and that the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were reduced in Hubei, except in Wuhan, two months after the lockdown was imposed. China’s Foreign Minister announced on March 26, 2020, that the entry of individuals with a visa or residence permit would be suspended from March 28, with no specific details on when this policy will be terminated.
Anyone wishing to enter China will need to apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged companies and factories to reopen on March 30, giving financial stimulus packages to companies. The Council of State declared a day of mourning, starting with a three-minute moment of silence throughout the country, on April 4 at 10 a.m., coinciding with the Qingming Festival. The central government, however, asked the families to pay their new tributes online, observing a distance from
On 20 January 2020, the spread of COVID-19 from China to South Korea was confirmed.
The country’s national health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on Feb. 20, largely attributed to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement, known as the Church of Jesus of Shincheonji.
It is suspected that Shincheonji devotees who visited Daegu from Wuhan were the origin of the outbreak.
On February 22, among the 9,336 followers of the church, 1,261, or about 13% of them, reported having symptoms. South Korea declared maximum alert level on February 23, 2020.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported, reaching 3,150 on February 29.
All military bases in South Korea were quarantined after tests confirmed three soldiers were positive for the virus.
The schedule of the airlines was also affected and modified. South Korea presented what was considered the largest and best organized program in the world in terms of screening the population for the virus. The country also isolated the infected people and tracked and quarantined those who came into contact with them.
The screening methods included mandatory individual symptom reporting for those arriving from international travel via a mobile app, testing the virus by drive-thru, with results available the next day, as well as increased testing capacity, which allowed up to 20,000 people per day to be tested.
South Korea’s program is considered a success in controlling the outbreak, although it did not put entire cities in quarantine. South Korean society was initially divided over the response to the crisis given by President Moon Jae-in.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon’s impeachment on the grounds of government mismanagement of the outbreak, or praising his response.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest total number of cases in four weeks.
On 29 March it was announced that from 1 April all new arrivals from abroad should be quarantined for two weeks.
Through media reports on April 1, South Korea received requests for help with testing the virus from 121 different countries.
Iran confirmed its first cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection on Feb. 19 in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died that day.
Early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events, and religious events on Fridays, the closure of universities, higher education institutions, and schools.
Iran has five trillion Rials to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on February 26, 2020 that he had no plans for the quarantined areas affected by the outbreak, and only individuals would be placed in quarantine.
Plans to limit travel between cities were announced in March, although heavy traffic between cities before the Persian New Year Nowruz continued.
Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. Iran became the center of the spread of the virus after China during February.
Amid allegations of cover-up of the spread of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries tracked their Iran-related cases on Feb. 28 indicating that the spread of the outbreak could be more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government to that date.
The Iranian parliament was closed, with 23 of its 290 members tested positive for the virus on March 3.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch vehemently called on the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders imprisoned for peaceful dissent, and also to temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
The agency said there was a greater risk of spreading the virus in institutions closed as detention centers, which also suffer from a lack of medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, the highest number since the outbreak began in the country.
At least 12 incumbent or retired politicians and government officials died as of March 17.
As of March 23, Iran had 50 new cases per hour and one new death every ten minutes due to the coronavirus.
According to a WHO representative, there should be five times more cases in Iran than are being reported.
It is suggested that U.S. sanctions imposed on Iran may be affecting the country’s financial ability to respond to the viral pandemic.
The High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for economic sanctions to be eased for nations most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy on January 31, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to escalate sharply, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
A group not associated with the COVID-19 cases was subsequently detected, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a decree-law to contain the outbreak, including the quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "In the areas of outbreak, the entry and exit of people are prohibited.
The suspension of work activities and sporting events had already been determined in these areas. "On March 4, the Italian government requested the total closure of all schools and universities in the country when Italy reached 100 deaths.
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, have to be held behind closed doors until April, but on March 9, all sporting events were completely suspended for at least a month.
On March 11, Prime Minister Conte requested the closure of almost all commercial activities except supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations regarding screening protocols that could be employed.
On March 19, Italy passed China as the country with the most coronavirus-related deaths in the world after reporting 3,405 pandemic-related deaths.
On March 22, it was reported that Russia sent nine military aircraft with medical supplies to Italy.
As of April 5, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recovered in Italy, with most of these cases occurring in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of an elderly population in Italy and the inability to test everyone who had the virus up to that time may have contributed to a high mortality rate.
The UK’s response to the virus first emerged as one of the mildest of the affected countries, and by March 18, 2020, the UK government had not imposed any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a consequence, the government received criticism for the recognized lack of diligence and intensity of its response to the problems faced by the population. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement in which he advised the interruption of all non-essential travel and social contact, suggesting that people work at home as much as possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theaters.
On March 20, the government announced that all leisure establishments such as pubs and academies should be closed as soon as possible, and pledged to pay 80% of workers' wages up to a limit of <0xC2><0xA3>2,500 per month to avoid unemployment during the crisis. On March 23, the Prime Minister announced heavier social distancing measures, preventing crowds with more than two people and restricting travel and activities to the open air.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were reinforced by the police through the issuance of fines and the dispersal of agglomerations.
Most businesses have been ordered to close, with exceptions for businesses deemed “essential,” including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations and auto shops.

Despite having done so, the United States had a slow start to testing, which concealed the true extent of the outbreak at the time.
The testing was marked by defective test kits produced by the federal government in February, a lack of federal government approval for non-government test kits (from academies, businesses and hospitals) by the end of February, and restrictive criteria for people who would be tested by early March (a medical request was subsequently required).
As of February 27, the Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
As of March 13, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted.

Belgium collected 100,000 unusable masks, supposedly from China, but actually from Colombia.
On the other hand, China’s aid was well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On April 2, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities to manage and contain the epidemic.
The WHO noted the contrast between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, where Chinese authorities were accused of omitting data that hampered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, where the central government “provided regular updates to avoid near-panic of the Lunar New Year festivities.”
On January 23, in reaction to the decision of the main authorities to implement a ban on transport in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that "that certainly was not a recommendation of the WHO" and was also "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the area where it was most concentrated".
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said the PHEIC was invoked due to the “risk of global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that “there is no reason for measures to interfere unnecessarily with international travel and trade” and that “WHO does not recommend limiting trade and displacement.”
On February 5, the WHO appealed to the global community for a $675 million contribution to fund strategic preparedness in low- and middle-income countries, citing the urgency of assisting those countries that “do not have systems in place to detect people who have contracted the virus, and even if it arises.”
Tedros made subsequent statements indicating that "we are as strong as our weakest link" and asked the international community "invest now or you will have to pay later". On February 11, the WHO at a press conference established COVID-19 as the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros declared that United Nations Secretary-General Ant<0xC3><0xB3>nio Guterres had agreed to provide "the power of the entire United Nations system as a response".
The United Nations Crisis Management Team has been activated as a result, allowing coordination of the entire United Nations response, which the WHO states will allow them to “focus on the health response while other agencies can enter with their experience in the social, economic and development implications resulting from the outbreak.”
On 14 February, a WHO Joint Mission Team with China was empowered to “declare even a pandemia” to international and WHO experts on the ground in China to provide assistance in domestic management and to assess “the severity and communicability of the disease” through workshops and meetings with the main national level institutions and to conduct field visits to assess “the impact of response activities at the levels of provinces and municipalities, including urban and rural panoramas.”
In response to a developing outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a Joint Mission Team to assess the situation. On February 28, WHO officials said that the assessment of the Coronavirus threat at the global level would be elevated from "high" to "very high", is the highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the health emergency program, warned in a statement that “This is a reality statement for every government on the planet: Wake up.
This virus may be on the way and you need to be ready,” insisting that the right response measures could help the world avoid “the worst.”
Ryan further stated that the current data did not authorize public health officials to declare a global pandemic, saying that such a statement would mean that “we are essentially accepting that every human on the planet will be exposed to this virus.”
On March 11, the WHO declared the Coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The Director-General said WHO was “deeply concerned about alarming levels of spread and severity, and alarming levels of inaction.” The WHO faced many criticisms for what was seen as inadequate pandemic management, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The reaction included a petition to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom to present his resignation, signed by 733,000 people on April 6.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts emphasized respect for the rights of each individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The group of experts stated that everyone has the right to life-saving interventions and that the government is responsible.
The group emphasized that the lack of resources or health plan should never serve as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
The experts stressed that every individual has the right to health, including people with disabilities, minorities, the elderly, people with mental problems, the homeless, those living in conditions of extreme poverty, prisoners, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government help.
International government organizations are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has launched a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as views and advice.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy to address the effects of travel confinement and restrictions, the digital hub includes a Country Policy Tracker, which helps countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the Coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, by the Cabinet Minister of the United Kingdom, Michael Gove, and by the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro for the management of the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) have been fired because of their approach to quarantine-related efforts in Central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the political establishment’s response to the outbreak in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping from public anger over the Coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, e.g. Zhao Lijian, rejected early recognition of the Coronavirus outbreak that began in Wuhan, favoring conspiracy theories about COVID-19 originating in the US or Italy.
Donald Trump’s U.S. administration referred to the Coronavirus as the “Chinese Virus” or “Wuhan Virus” saying that China’s censorship “overfed a virus that has now become a global pandemic,” which was, in turn, condemned by some critics as racism and “a way of diverting the administration’s failure to contain the disease.”
The Daily Beast got from a U.S. government cable a detailed communication ploy with apparent origins in the National Security Council, with a strategy being quoted as "This has everything to do with China.
“Channels such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have indicated that China’s efforts to send aid to countries hit by the virus is part of a propaganda campaign for global influence.
European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there is "a geopolitical component including a struggle for influence through a biased viewpoint and 'policies of generosity.'"
Borrell also said that “China is aggressively spreading the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner.”
China also asked the United States to suspend its sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while allegedly sending aid to those same countries.
Jack Ma’s donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by U.S. sanctions on April 3.
U.S. officials have also been accused of diverting aid to other nations into their own country.
And hears disputes related to masks reported among other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey confiscated hundreds of fans destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticised the European Union’s lack of solidarity with those affected by the coronavirus in Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the European Union, said: "Only China has responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign of European solidarity.”
On March 22, after a phone call with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian military army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous “high-level political source” that 80 percent of Russia’s supplies were “useless or of little use to Italy.”
The source accused Russia of embarking on a "geopolitical and diplomatic" offensive.
The president of the Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Luigi Di Maio, dismissed the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical supplies to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that “by offering help to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials are at a good stage, they would also act reciprocally if necessary.”
The planned NATO military exercise "Defend 2020" in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, NATO's largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be kept on a reduced scale.
The Secretary General for the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign, Kate Hudson, criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, this puts at risk the lives not only of the troops of the United States and the various European countries that are participating, but of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate." The Iranian government was heavily affected by the virus, with about a dozen members of parliament infected, as well as qui
Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders, asking for help on March 14, 2020, saying that his country is struggling to combat the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of U.S. sanctions against Iran. The outbreak has led the United States to adopt common social policies in other developed countries, including universal health care, universal child care, family leave, and paid leave.
Political analysts have anticipated that this could negatively affect Donald Trump’s chances of being re-elected as president in the 2020 election.
South Korea has criticized Japan’s ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts after Japan announced that anyone coming from South Korea would be placed in a two-week quarantine at government-designated locations.
South Korean society was initially polarized over President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon’s impeachment of what they have called inadequate management of the outbreak, or praising his response. The pandemic has allowed countries to pass emergency laws in response.
Some commentators have expressed concerns that this could allow governments to strengthen their control over power.
In Hungary, parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament as well as elections and punish those deemed to have spread false news about the virus and the government’s management of the crisis.
The Coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for several cases of shortages of supplies, resulting from the increased use of equipment globally to combat outbreaks, panic-driven purchases, and disruption of factory and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medications and medical equipment due to increased consumption and supplier disruptions.
Several locals also experienced the panic-driven shopping event which led to empty shelves of essential products such as food, toilet paper, bottled water, including shortages of supplies.
The technology industry in particular has been warning about delays in shipping electronic products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, demand for personal protective equipment has risen 100 times.
This demand led to an increase in prices of up to twenty times the normal price and also induced delays in the supply of medical items for four to six months.
This has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, with the WHO warning that it would put workers’ health at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Chinese buyers, daigou, to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of baby formulas in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the consequent high demand for food products, both areas were spared from acute food shortages.
Measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal storage and trade of essential products have been successful, avoiding the acute food shortages that have been foreseen in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy with its significant agricultural production has not seen a large reduction, but prices may rise according to industry representatives.
Empty food shelves were found only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, and Chinese government officials released pork stocks to ensure sufficient food for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy, requiring food producers to maintain reserves for such emergencies.
A damage to the global economy was felt in China: according to a media report on March 16, the economy in China was hit hard in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the government to shorten the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5 percent.
As mainland China is a large economy and manufacturing hub, the viral outbreak has been seen as a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist’s intelligence unit predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture emerges of possible outcomes.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could outpace the SARS outbreak of 2002-2004.
An estimate by an expert at the University of Washington in St. Louis indicated a $300 billion impact on the world’s supply chain that could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) reportedly “confused” after a sharp decline in oil prices due to low demand from China.
Global stock markets fell on Feb. 24 due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside Mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the Coronavirus outbreak, several U.S. stock market indexes including the NASDAQ-100, S&P 500, and the Dow Jones industry average showed their most significant declines since 2008, with the Dow falling by 1,191 points, the biggest one-day drop since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
All three other indices ended the week with a drop of more than 10%.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH affirmed China’s sovereign credit rating but maintained a negative outlook.
Stocks fell again based on concerns about the coronavirus, the biggest drop on March 16.
Many consider a likely economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures of states and central banks.
Central banks are reacting faster than they reacted to the financial collapse of 2008.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel restrictions, the closure of public places including tourist spots, and the recommendation of governments against any trip around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled their flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while the British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the cruise industry has been of a level never seen before.
Several train stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Chunyun, a large travel station associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
Several events involving large crowds have been cancelled by national and regional governments, including the annual New Year’s festivals, with private companies also independently closing their stores and tourist attractions such as Disneyland in Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass crowds, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple events.
In 24 of China’s 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities have extended the New Year’s holiday to February 10, instructing most workplaces not to reopen by this date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has raised its level of response to infectious disease to the highest level and declared an emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling its New Year celebrations. The retail sector has been affected globally, with reductions in store hours or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America fell 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a drop of 50-60%.
This also resulted in a 33-43% drop in pedestrian traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
Shopping center operators around the world have imposed additional measures, such as increased cleaning, installation of thermal scanners to check shoppers’ temperature, and cancellation of events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, it is estimated that the pandemic-induced recession could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would occur in situations without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China’s 300 million rural migrant workers were left abandoned at home in inland provinces or imprisoned in Hubei Province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government aid.
The Coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The confinement in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who are paid through daily remuneration) unemployed. A survey by the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian households have gone through some 90.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for unemployment assistance and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit program. Nearly half a million companies in Germany put their workers under government-subsidized reduced-time work programs known as Kurzarbeit.
The German reduced-time work pay programme has been adopted by France and Britain.
Performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been profoundly affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of organizations as well as people – both employed and independent – worldwide.
Arts and culture sector organizations have tried to maintain their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage for the community, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and help artists when possible.
In March 2020, around the world and at various levels, museums, bookstores, performance venues, and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely with their exhibitions, events, and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, there have been intensive efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and rapidly accelerating repercussion of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences, and fashion events.
The Vatican announced that the rites of Holy Week in Rome, which would take place during the last week of the Christian Lent period, had been canceled.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay at home rather than attend Mass on Sundays; some churches have made church services available via radio, live online streaming or television while others offer drive-in-style services.
With the Roman Catholic Diocese closing its churches and chapels and St. Peter's Square empty without Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled services and limited public agglomerations in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
Iran’s Health Ministry announced Friday’s cancellation of prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and sanctuaries were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims from entering as well as its residents at sacred sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant disruption to the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most major events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-2020 UEFA Champions League, 2019-2020 Premier League, 2019-2020 NBA season, and 2019-2020 NHL season.
The outbreak interfered with plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "rescheduled for a date after 2020, but not after the summer of 2021". Casinos and other gaming venues around the world were closed and face-to-face poker tournaments were also postponed or cancelled.
This has led many players to play online, with several online gaming sites reporting significant increases in their new enrollment rates. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with several music groups suspending or canceling their tours.
Many major theaters such as those on Broadway also canceled all shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue to produce and share their work over the internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live streaming shows or creating online “festivals” for artists to perform, share and publicize their work.
Online, several memes on the internet about the coronavirus are propagated, as many seek humor and entertainment amid uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese or East Asian descent, and against people in focus areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, mistrust, and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
February results (when most cases were still restricted to China) recorded racist sentiments expressed in various groups around the world that the Chinese people deserve the virus or are receiving fair punishment for what they provoked.
Some countries in Africa have also identified an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many inhabitants of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
This has been supported by Chinese, both online and offline, and is directed at those in the areas affected by the virus.
After the spread of the outbreak in new focus countries, citizens of Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious COVID-19 outbreak, could also be subject to mistrust and xenophobia. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions pushing for a ban on Chinese entry into their countries in an attempt to contain the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan went to Twitter’s Trending Topics.
Chinese people, as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States, have reported increasing levels of racist insults as well as attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump has come under fire for referring to the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus,” a term critics regard as racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeastern India, which borders China, and students in major cities in India allegedly suffered persecution related to the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, chairman of the unit in the state of Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, said the Chinese had destroyed nature and “that’s why God turned against them.”
The comments were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Calcutta, who called him "wrong." In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese people were inflamed by the pandemic, with foreigners labeled "foreign trash" and targeted for "disposal."
Many paid-access newspapers have removed them from some or all of the coverage of the coronavirus.
Several scientific editors have made available scientific articles related to the outbreak with open access.
Some scientists have chosen to share their findings as soon as possible on preprint servers, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory analyses for 2019 coronavirus respiratory disease (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and developed only to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (sorology) can be used for population diagnosis and monitoring.
Antibody tests reveal how many people had the disease, including those whose symptoms were too mild to report or who became asymptomatic.
An accurate rate of disease mortality and herd immunity level in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020 no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there are considerable variations in the number of tests carried out in the countries.
This variability is likely to still substantially affect mortality rates in recorded cases, which may be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal smear or saliva sample.
The results are usually available within a few hours or within 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed with pharyngeal smear is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear in the throat as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For infected people tested in the second week, as an alternative, material from the samples can be removed from the bottom of the airways by suction catheter or material expelled by sputum (secretion) can be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed at Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and serves as the basis for 250,000 kits for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test on January 23, 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical type, a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
It searches for the public gene "E" shared by all the beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp-diagnostic RdRp gene, specific to SARS-CoV-2. In China, the BGI group was one of the first companies to receive approval for emergency use from the National Medical Products Administration of China for the PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit. In the United States, its Control and Prevention Center is
One of the three genetic tests in older versions of the test kits generated inconclusive tests based on failed reagents, and an impediment to testing at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout the month of February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and only then were local and state laboratories allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the shelter of an emergency use authorization. Commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of the test for COVID-19 based on RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics also made COVID-19 testing nationally available as of March 9, 2020.
No quantity restrictions have been announced; collection and processing of samples must be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center on Virology and Biotechnology, VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic claimed to have developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed within 3.5 hours on a large scale, thus allowing a machine to process approximately 4,128 tests in a 24-hour period.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (E.U.) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott’s m2000 system; the FDA previously issued an authorization to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received a U.S. from the FDA for a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can generate positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott expects to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day. A test that uses a monoclonal antibody and binds it in a particular way to the nucleocapsid protein (protein N) of the new coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, with the expectation of providing results in 15 to 20 minutes such as a rapid flu test.
A literature review in March 2020 concluded that "thorax x-rays have a lower diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT findings, computed tomography, may be present even before the onset of symptoms."
Typical features in CT include bilateral multilobal opacities in frosted glass with a posterior, peripheral and asymmetric distribution.
Subpleural dominance, mosaic paving and consolidation evolve as the disease progresses.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan at the point of origin of the current pandemic suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many of its imaging aspects coinciding with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19." As of March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for an initial checkup.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in individuals initiated 7 days ago or soon after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity, and in population monitoring. The tests can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or through remote laboratory tests (PoCT).
The high-productivity automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For CLT, a single peripheral blood sample is commonly used, although numerous samples can be used to track the immune response.
For PoCT, a single blood sample is usually obtained by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, the collection step is not required before testing. On March 26, 2020, the FDA indicated 29 entities that have notified the agency, as required, and are now eligible to distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA with an authorization for emergency use. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approvals for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies to the virus in blood samples.
The testing capacity is several hundred samples in a matter of hours and therefore much faster than conventional viral RNA PCR tests.
Antibodies are normally detected 14 days after the onset of infection. In early April, the UK considered that none of the acquired antibody test kits were adequate enough to be used.
Hong Kong has organized a system in which suspected patients can stay at home, "emergency department will give a sampling tube to the patient", they must expel saliva into the tube, send it back and get a result shortly after. The British NHS announced that it is coordinating a system to test suspected cases at home, which eliminates the risk of a patient infecting others if they go to the hospital or the need to desinfect.
Drive-thru centers have helped South Korea conduct some of the fastest and most comprehensive tests in a country. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that it had capacity for about 12,000 tests per day in outpatient care, with 10,700 having been tested in the previous week.
The costs are borne by the health insurance when the test is requested by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity for 160,000 tests per week.
Since March 19, drive-in tests have been offered in several large cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests conducted in Germany remains unknown, as only positive tests are recorded.
The first research laboratory revealed that from the 12th week of 2020 onwards a total of at least 5<0xC2><0xB0> GI samples were processed by the English <0xC2><0xAB> <0xC2><0xAB> <0xC2><0xAB> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0> <0xC2><0xB0>
With the construction overseen by BGI founder Wang Jian, and taking 5 days, the modeling revealed that the cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the corresponding cost to deal with the quarantine would have doubled if that testing capacity did not have online access.
The Wuhan lab was promptly followed by Huo-Yan labs in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
On March 4, 2020, the total daily yield was 50,000 tests per day. Open source multiplexed models released by Origami Assays were released as capable of testing up to 1,122 patient samples for COVID-19, using only 93 trials. These balanced models can be run in small laboratories without the need for robotic manipulators for liquids.
In March, scarcity or insufficient amounts of reagent became a barrier to mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led some authors to study sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples to 98 <0xC2><0xB0>C (208 <0xC2><0xB0>F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On March 31, it was reported that the UAE is now testing more per capita in its population for the Coronavirus than other countries, and would be on track to increase the level of testing and achieve greater
This resulted in a combination of drive-thru capability, and acquisition of a Group 42 population-scale mass processing laboratory and BGI (inspired by its “Huo-Yan” emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the lab is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the world’s first of its kind to operate outside of China.
Different test methods targeting different components of the genetic profile of the coronavirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted Germany’s method for manufacturing kits sent to low-income countries that lack the resources to develop their own.
The German method was released on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control was not available until January 28, there was a delay in the tests made available to the U.S. and China, and the United States faced problems with the reliability of test kits early in the outbreak, in addition, these countries with Australia were unable to provide enough kits to meet the demand and recommendations for testing by professionals made.
In contrast, experts say South Korea’s wide availability for testing has helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
Testing capacity, largely in private sector laboratories, has been consolidated over many years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization indicated the strengthening of testing programs as the best way to slow the advance of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for tests due to the widespread spread of the virus caused the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States, and the supply of cotton swabs and chemical reagents was affected.
In March 2020, China reported problems accurately in its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC presented "failures"; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented private testing. Spain acquired test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but considered the results inaccurate.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be a result of a failure to collect samples or incorrect use of the kits.
The Spanish minister said he would cancel the kits that generated incorrect results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic bought from China generated wrong results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China considered inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that they would be discarded in the Danube. Ates Kara of Turkey's Ministry of Health said that Turkey's test kits purchased from China had a "high error rate" and that it would not "use them". The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits from China, but in early April 2020 announced that they were not useful.
The testing, followed by quarantine of those who tested positive and monitoring of those with whom people positive for SARS-CoV-2 had contact, had positive results.
The researchers working in the Italian city of V<0xC3><0xB2>, the site of the first death from COVID-19 in Italy, carried out two stages of testing of the entire population of approximately 3,400 people, with an interval of about ten days.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all of the cases discovered were quarantined.
With the commuting to the restricted commune, this eliminated new infections completely.
With aggressive contact monitoring, travel restrictions to the country, testing and quarantine, the coronavirus pandemic in Singapore in 2020 has advanced much slower than in other developed countries, and without radical restrictions such as the mandatory closure of restaurants and retail outlets.
Many events were canceled, and Singapore began seriously advising residents to stay home on March 28, but schools reopened on schedule after the holidays on March 23.
Many other countries have also managed the pandemic with aggressive contact monitoring, travel restrictions to the country, testing and quarantine, but with less aggressive lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study identified that countries that performed more tests, in relation to the number of deaths, had lower mortality rates, probably because these countries are better able to detect those with no or little symptoms.
The WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity and have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and the first ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column "Positive in % of tests" is influenced by the testing policy of the countries.
A country that tests only people admitted to hospitals will have a higher percentage of positive tests than a country that has tested all citizens, whether they have symptoms or not, the other characteristics are equivalent.
Hand washing (or hand cleaning), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of washing hands for the purpose of removing dirt, fat, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap constantly at certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by the oro-fecal route.
People can also be infected with respiratory diseases such as the flu or a common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five crucial moments during the day when washing hands with soap are important include: before and after defecation, after wiping the child’s buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before meals and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, frank or fish.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be sanitized with ash. The World Health Organization recommends hand hygiene:
Before, during and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who has used the bathroom.
After blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animal, feed or animal waste.
Clinical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medicine or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of disease.
The main purpose of hand washing is to clean the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease.
This is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reducing the infant mortality rate in home births.
A 2013 study revealed that best practices for hand washing can cause small improvements in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developed countries, infant mortality rates related to diarrhea and respiratory diseases can be reduced by simply introducing behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple attitude can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote hand washing can reduce episodes of diarrhea by about a third, which is comparable to providing clean water to needy areas.
48% of reductions in diarrhea episodes may be associated with handwashing with soap. Handwashing with soap is the most effective and cost-effective way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI), such as automatic behavior performed in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, the leading IRA, is the leading cause of mortality among children under the age of five, taking the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together are responsible for nearly 3.5 million deaths of children annually.
According to UNICEF, turning handwashing with soap before eating and after using the bathroom into an entrenched habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Handwashing is usually associated with other sanitary interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene facilities (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo that is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A less significant negative effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin lesions as a result of skin dryness.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can cause a skin peeling and irritating condition known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among health care workers.
Frequent hand washing is also perceived as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five crucial moments during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the fecal-oral transmission of diseases: after using the toilet (micking, defecation), after cleaning a child’s butt (changing diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a food or handling raw meat, fish or chicken.
Other situations when the correct technique for hand washing should be practiced in order to prevent the transmission of diseases include before and after treating a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing or blowing the nose; after touching animal waste or dealing with animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, there is a reduced rate of hand washing with soap.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that, on average, 38.7% of the households in the households were in the habit of washing their hands with soap. A 2014 study revealed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate with 97 percent; the United States near the average with 77 percent; and China with the lowest rate with 23 percent. Several methods for behavioral changes currently exist to increase the acceptance of hand washing in the households.
The “Essential Health Services Program” implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a large-scale action to promote children’s health and education.
Deworming twice a year, supplemented with daily hand washing with soap, daily toothbrushing with fluoride, are at the heart of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin is enhanced by adding soaps and detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barriers to solution, and increase solubility.
Water alone is an ineffective cleansing agent for the skin, because fats and proteins, components of organic dirt, are not easily dissolved in water.
Cleaning is, however, facilitated by a reasonable flow of water...
Bar soap, depending on its reusable nature, can retain accumulated bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies that looked at the bacterial transmission of a contaminated bar soap concluded that transmission is unlikely since the bacteria are rinsed with the foam.
The CDC reiterates "liquid soap with automatic commands for dosing is preferable".
Antibacterial soaps have been widely publicized to the health conscious public.
To date, there is no evidence that using recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can lead to the selection of antibiotic-resistant organisms in the wild.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms.
So even though antibiotic-resistant strains are not selected by antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are advertised.
In addition to the surfactants and skin protection agents, the complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as a pH regulator, antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other moisturizers to remove back to the skin (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that the final soaps are
Hot water that is comfortable for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37<0xC2><0xB0>C).
However, hot water with soap is more effective than cold water with soap to remove the natural oiliness that retains dirt and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies have revealed that using hot water is not effective at reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or antiseptic is a non-water based hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-based non-water based hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol-based hand sanitizer, antiseptic hand sanitizer, or hand sanitizer) began to gain popularity.
Most are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickening agent, such as carbomer (polymer or acrylic acid), in gel, or a humectant, such as glycerin, in liquid, or in foam to facilitate use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers that contain a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol kill germs efficiently.
Alcohol-based sanitizers kill bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based sanitizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (reduction of 3.5 logarithms, similar to the reduction of 35 decibels) of bacteria in the hands, 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of 4 to 5 logarithms) of bacteria in the hands 1 minute after application. Hand sanitizers are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost totally ineffective against the norovirus (or Norwalk) virus, the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. Hand antiseptics or alcohol-based sanitizers can be used to moisten or cover both hands well.
The back and palms of the hands, between the fingers and their extremities are rubbed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.
The tips of the fingers should also be thoroughly washed, being rubbed with both palms. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing the hands with hand sanitizers, especially when the hands are visually dirty.
The increasing use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid exterminating action against microorganisms; however, they should not replace proper hand washing unless soap and water are not available.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers may cause skin to dry out unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused substantially less skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in alcohol-based hand sanitizers rarely occur.
The lesser tendency to cause irritating contact dermatitis has become an attraction when compared to hand washing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water based agents do not clean their hands of organic matter, only disinfect them.
It is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective as water and soap for preventing the spread of many pathogens, since the pathogens still remain in the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is extremely dependent on substances and formulation, and has historically fallen far short of alcohol and alcohol-based sanitizers.
More recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial action after application, different from alcohol, which has been shown to have reduced efficacy after recurrent use, probably due to increasing adverse reactions on the skin.
Many people in low-income communities can’t afford a soap and instead use ash or dirt.
Grey or earth may be more effective than pure water, but may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if the soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, the spread of the disease may increase rather than decrease.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfecting agent, since in contact with water it forms an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommends ash and sand as an alternative to soap when there is no soap.
The correct handwashing technique recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Rinse your hands with hot or cold running water.
It is recommended running water since fixed sinks may be contaminated, while the water temperature does not seem to be relevant.
Rub your hands, rubbing them with a generous amount of soap, including the backs of your hands, the space between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies reveal that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when soap is used instead of pure water.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
The act of rubbing generates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and rubbing for a longer time removes more germs.
Rinse well with running water.
Washing in a sink can re-contaminate your hands.
Dry with a dry towel or let it dry outdoors.
Wet or wet hands are more easily re-contaminated. The most commonly forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, areas between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and chipped nail polishes can harbor microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to keep your hands hydrated; dry skin can cause skin lesions capable of increasing the risk of infection transmission.
Several low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing where there is no running water and/or soap, for example, pouring water from a gallon or cuia with suitable holes and/or using ash if necessary in developing countries. In situations with restricted water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions for storing water, such as "cost makeshift lathes" and other options.
An improvised faucet is a simple technology that uses a pitcher suspended by a rope, and a lever driven by the feet to pour a small amount of water into the hands and a bar of soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand sanitization process, but there is a discussion about the most effective way to dry in public toilets.
A growing volume of research suggests that towel papers are far more hygienic than the electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the paper towel industry, European Tissue Symposium, to compare the levels of hygiene presented by paper towel, hand dryers with heated air and the most modern hand dryers with jet air.
After washing and drying hands with a heated air dryer, the total number of bacteria was considered, on average, 194% higher in the area of the palm near the fingers and 254% in the rest of the palm.
Drying with air jet dryers resulted in an increase in the total number of bacteria, on average, of 42% in the area of the palm near the fingers and about 15% in the rest of the palm.
After washing and drying hands with paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced, on average, by up to 76% in the palm area near the fingers and up to 77% in the rest of the palm. The researchers also performed tests to define whether there was potential for cross-contamination between other users and the bathroom environment as a consequence of each type of drying method.
The air jet dryer, which projects air out of the unit at indicated speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to expel microorganisms from the hands and from the unit potentially contaminating other users of the bathroom and the environment up to 2 meters away.
The use of hand dryer with hot air spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
The towel papers did not present a significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt and Umwelt, different methods for hand drying were evaluated.
The following changes in bacterial count after hand drying were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towel drying.
Hand washing with hand sanitizer wipes is an alternative to the lack of soap and water during travel.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Clinical handwashing became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing diseases in the hospital setting.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind the hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found that infection rates decreased with its use.
Clinical hand washing is for a minimum of 15 seconds, using generous amounts of soap and water or gel to soap and rub all parts of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed simultaneously with the interlacing of the fingers.
If there are residues under the nails, a brush can be used to remove them.
Since germs can remain in the water in your hands, it is important to rinse well and dry with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the faucet (and open the door if necessary).
This prevents re-contamination of the hands by these surfaces.
The goal of handwashing in the healthcare environment is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of handwashing remains at unacceptable levels in most medical settings, with a large number of doctors and nurses constantly forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thereby transmitting microorganisms.
One study revealed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can decrease the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66 percent.The World Health Organization published a bulletin demonstrating the pattern of hand washing and rubbing in healthcare system sectors.
The organization’s hand hygiene guidance project can also be found on this site for comments.
An applicable review was performed by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and validate hand hygiene if demonstration of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization defines "Five Moments" for hand washing:
after exposure to body/blood fluids
before an ascetic task, and
after patient care. The addition of antiseptic chemicals to the soap ("medical" or "antimicrobial" soaps) confers an exterminating action to a hand washing agent.
Such exterminating action may be desirable before performing surgery or in situations in which antibiotic-resistant organisms are predominant. To "clean" the hands for a surgical operation it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching it with one's hands, some antiseptics of chlorhexidine or iodine, sterilized towels for drying this, and this to dry the hands after the
All jewelry should be removed.
This procedure requires washing the hands and forearms to the elbows, usually for 2-6 minutes.
A very long cleaning time (10 minutes) is not necessary.
At the time of washing, water on the forearms should not drain to the hands.
After the hand washing is finished, the hands are wiped off with a sterilized towel and the surgical gown is dressed.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after caring for a sick person.
For the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that there was a greater benefit of hand cleaning in the first 20% of washing, and an additional little significant benefit was obtained when the frequency of cleaning exceeded 35%.
Washing with ordinary soap more than triples the rate of antibacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food compared to washing with an antibacterial soap. Comparing hand sanitization with an alcohol-based solution with hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average time of 30 seconds for each one revealed that the hand sanitizer reduced an alcohol-based 2 hand sanitizer.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand sanitizers to reduce influenza A virus, H1N1, and Clostridium difficile spores on the hands. Interventions to increase hand sanitization in hospital settings may involve raising staff awareness about hand washing, increased availability of hand sanitizers and alcohol-based hand sanitizers.
There is a need for more research on which interventions are most effective in different health facilities.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is considered an essential economically viable tool for good health and even better nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water sources, soap or handwashing resources in people’s homes, schools and workplaces makes this a challenge to achieve the universal practice of handwashing.
For example, in most rural Africa handwashing taps close to any public or private toilets are rare, although there are cheap options for building handwashing stations.
However, low hand washing rates may instead be the result of ingrained habits and not the absence of soap and water.
The encouragement and advocacy of handwashing with soap can influence political decisions, lead to awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and cause a long-term change in population behavior.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective for increasing handwashing in low- and middle-income countries, while social marketing campaigns are less efficient. An example for promoting handwashing in schools is UNICEF’s “Three-Star Approach” that encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive steps to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other requirements.
When a minimum level is reached, schools can go from one to the maximum three stars.
The construction of handwashing stations can be a part of promotional handwashing campaigns carried out with the aim of reducing diseases and infant mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness campaign trying to achieve a change of habit. As a result of the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has released the adoption of a handwashing emoji.
Few studies have considered the overall cost-benefit ratio of hand washing in developing countries in relation to DALY classification.
However, one analysis suggests that promoting handwashing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health—especially for people in vulnerable circumstances such as mothers who have just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals—was initially recognized in the mid-19th century by two forerunners of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the English "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant odors called miasmas.
In the 1980s, foodborne outbreaks and healthcare-associated infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively encourage hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have raised awareness in many countries about the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "technics for proper hand washing" were hung next to hand washing sinks in public toilets and in bathrooms of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The expression “washing hands” means declaring reluctance to take responsibility or to be conniving with something.
It originates from the biblical passage in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a phrase in more general use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins washing her hands compulsively in an attempt to clear an imaginary stain, representing her guilty conscience in relation to the crimes she had committed and led her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people, after remembering or witnessing unethical acts, tend to wash their hands more often than others, and usually give more importance to hand washing equipment.
In addition, those who can wash their hands after such a vision are less likely to perform other compensatory acts of “cleansing,” such as volunteering.
Religions prescribe hand washing for hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, using water but not soap, to wash hands is part of a ritual hand washing characteristic in many religions, including the Bah<0xC3><0xA1>'<0xC3><0xAD> faith, Hinduism, the tevilah and the netilat yadayim in Judaism, the lava.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam permit hand washing after toilet use.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and Islam allow for hand washing before and after meals.
Workplace Hazard Controls for COVID-19
Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19 are the application of occupational health and safety methodologies for hazard controls for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate hazard controls in the workplace depend on the workplace and the work itself, based on the risk assessment of the sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of individual workers, who may be vulnerable to contracting COVID-19.
According to the Department of Occupational Health and Safety (OSHA), functions with the lowest risk of exposure have minimal occupational contact with the public and other co-workers, for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including washing hands, encouraging employees to stay home if they are sick, maintaining a respiratory label, and a routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Functions at medium risk of exposure include those requiring frequent or direct contact with people about whom it is not known whether they are contaminated or suspected of being contaminated by COVID-19, but who may be infected due to current community transmission or having traveled abroad.
This includes workers who maintain contact with the general public such as in schools, high-density work environments, and in the large-volume retail market.
Hazard controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include used ventilation of high-efficiency air filters, protective coverings and the availability of personal protective equipment if a person is confirmed with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that health system and morgue workers who are exposed to people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 are at high risk of exposure, which increases the risk of exposure to very high if workers perform procedures on people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 aerosol generation and collect or handle specimens from these people.
Suitable hazard controls for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for the work performed.
The COVID-19 epidemic can have several effects in the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work because they are sick, because they have to take care of others, or because they are afraid of possible exposure.
Trade patterns can change, both in terms of which products are in demand and the means of acquiring those products (such as shopping outside peak hours or for delivery or drive-thru services).
Finally, the sending of items from areas severely affected by COVID-19 can be stopped. An action plan and preparation for infectious disease can be used to guide protective actions.
The plans address the levels of risk associated with various workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors that arise at home and in the community, and risk factors for individual workers such as advanced age or chronic medical conditions.
They also define the controls needed to address these risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of epidemics.
Infectious disease preparedness and action plans may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives for action for an epidemic include reducing transmission among employees, protecting people who are most at risk of developing health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community, where the company is located, affects the actions taken.
The hazard control hierarchy is a widely used framework in occupational health and safety to group hazard controls by effectiveness.
When the dangers of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and, finally, personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related hazards without counting on worker behavior, and may be the most cost-effective implementation solution.
Engineering controls are changes in work policy or procedures that require the action of the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of PPE should be selected on the basis of hazard to the worker, appropriately adjusted as necessary (e.g. respirators), used appropriately and continuously, regularly inspected, stored and replaced as necessary, and removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of appropriately to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Department of Occupational Health and Safety (OSHA), jobs with low exposure risk have minimal occupational contact with the public and other co-workers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and meticulous handwashing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, and the use of the respiratory label, including covering sneezing and coughing, preparing containers for tissues and common garbage, preparing for teleworking and other tooling and disposing shifts, if necessary.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is an essential step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory disease stay at home until they no longer have a fever, signs of fever or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of these medications to reduce fever or relief from other symptoms, and also recommends that sick leave policies be flexible and allow employees to take care of their health.
According to OSHA, work at medium risk of exposure includes work requiring frequent or direct 6-foot (1.8 m) contact with people who are not known to be confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to current community transmission at the company’s location, or because the individual has a recent history of travel abroad in a country with high COVID-19 transmission.

Workers in this risk group rarely need respirators.
If a person becomes ill on an airplane, adequate controls to protect workers and other passengers include isolating the sick person from other people by a distance of 6 feet, with the designation of a crew member to serve the sick person and offer him a face mask, or asking the sick person to cover his mouth and nose with tissues when coughing or sneezing.
The crew should wear disposable medical gloves when serving a sick passenger or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the sick patient presents with fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be discarded in a bag for biohazardous waste, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected next. For commercial transportation, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, hazard controls include deferring travel by the sick passenger, self-isolation, and immediate communication to the medical center on board if someone develops fever or other symptoms during the trip.
For schools and child care centers, the CDC recommends temporary closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person was present in the building, regardless of the spread of the virus in the community.
When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as canceling field trips, assemblies, and other large groupings such as physical education classes or corals, or meals in a snack bar, increasing the space between tables, tighter arrival and departure times, limiting non-essential visitors, and using a separate health care site for children with flu symptoms.
When there is significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, prolonged school dispensations may be considered. For law enforcement authorities who perform daily activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by the CDC.
It is recommended that police officers who come in contact with individuals suspected of COVID-19 or with the confirmed disease follow the same guidelines as emergency medicine technicians, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
If direct contact occurs during seizure, workers should clean and disinfect their belt and other accessories before using them again using a common household cleaning spray or cloth and follow standard operating procedures for the containment and disposal of used PPE and for the containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers certain health care and morgue workers to be in high or very high exposure risk categories.
Functions at high risk of exposure include drug delivery, medical care, laboratory and medical transport workers, who are exposed to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.
The risk of exposure becomes very high if workers perform aerosol generation procedures in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, or collect or handle specimens from these patients.
Aerosol generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some procedures and dental examinations, or invasive specimen collection.
Work in high-exposure morgues includes workers involved with the preparation of bodies of people with confirmed COVID-19 or with suspected disease at the time of their death; the risk of exposure makes it very high if they perform autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed COVID-19 or with suspected disease, including when aerosol-generating procedures are performed.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some morgue scenarios and in the health area.
Specimens should be handled with biosafety level 3 caution.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who enter the hospital be separated into two separate waiting areas depending on whether they are a suspected case of COVID-19. In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends respirators for professionals working at a distance of 6 feet from patients with confirmation or suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and for professionals who perform aerosol-generating procedures.
In the United States, N95 particulate filtered facial respirators, NIOSH approved respirators, or higher quality respirators must be used in the context of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program that includes fit tests, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide protection and improve worker comfort. The WHO does not recommend the use of overalls, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, and is not transmitted by non-respiratory body fluids.
The WHO recommends only one surgical mask for screening staff at the point of entry.
For professionals who collect respiratory specimens, treat or transport COVID-19 patients without aerosol-generating procedures, the WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective glasses or facial protection, surgical apron and gloves.
If an aerosol-generating procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given that the global supply of PPE is insufficient, the WHO recommends minimizing the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as clear windows, allowing only those involved in direct patient care to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, using only the PPE necessary for the specific task, continuous use of the same respirator without removing it while treating several patients with the same diagnosis.

We find ourselves in unusual circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes clear our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have towards each other.
Their challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best actions go hand in hand with global empathy, cooperation and the creation of communities, which are the foundations of this organization.
The companionship and concern we have seen among all our colleagues through emails, calls, and conversations is a remarkable validation of the amazing human beings with whom we have the privilege of working.
I am immensely grateful and proud to have all of you as co-workers.
Last week, someone shared with me their recognition for our work.
This person reminded me of how significant it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia now, and how powerful a symbol it is that this essential feature remains online and available to everyone.
Your work makes this possible, as you keep the workplaces active, pay our co-workers and keep our communities safe.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides, more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do, but the way we do it, will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and its role in it, we will make important adjustments to the way we work together, starting next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, Team C met last night to discuss our approach and schedules for the coming days and months.
In this meeting, we consider what we think is an action appropriate to what we are experiencing and the best way to keep the organization sustainable during this period.
We want to end stress and support our mission in the long term.
If you need to be away for a while, no problem.
For all employees, service providers and contract workers:
Our daily work expectation will be 4 hours, or 20 hours per week, until otherwise stated.
We're not declaring a holiday, so if you can get to work at normal hours, it could be useful for our mission.
However, the world is unpredictable now, and whether you need to take care of loved ones, buy groceries or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your schedule.
If you're sick, don't work.
This rule would not even need to be expressed, but we decided to declare it.
No certificate or paid leave is required. Just tell your manager to help your team review the schedule and schedules to ensure key areas of work are met.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, inform Bryan of the training and certification industry so that his industry can help you and ensure that your situation receives appropriate management attention.)
Personnel working hourly will receive full payment.
We’ve said this before, and we’re committed to honoring our commitment to our contractors and hourly employees.
Everyone will receive their salaries based on their normal work schedule under normal circumstances.
Salaries are independent of whether you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we give you full support.
Many people see work as a way to channel stress due to the current situation in the world.
The work we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like these.
Remembering that your well-being is more important.
We only ask that you communicate with your manager, so that we know what to expect and can help the activities properly.
Some functions are considered essential.
There are activities that we must continue to carry out.
The teams of Site Reliability Engineering, HR, Reliability and Security and Fundraising (among others) perform essential activities that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to assess current goals and shift our focus to support what is essential to our mission.
There is a lot to do for all of us, and we will focus our efforts on the most essential projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt us in the future.
We don’t intend to “work hard to make up for lost time” after the pandemic is over.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are now impractical.
We accept that circumstances have changed, and will work to set new goals and deadlines as appropriate.
What will happen to the annual planning?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of hours worked per day, we intend to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which will provide more time for budgeting, and for employees to prioritize the essential work, personal care and care of loved ones, while accommodating those who need or want to work on a reduced journey in the coming weeks.
The schedule extension greatly reduces the current planning workloads and pressure across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the board next week and update representatives and teams on the next steps as soon as we have confirmation.
We thank the Annual Planning team for their leadership in this process.
Status, exposure and office cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our co-workers in San Francisco may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
In view of this situation, as a precaution, we employed an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used a special antiviral solution for hospitals to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the lobby and all elevators that give access to our floor.
The building is employing its own protocol of care duties using products that are safe for its patrons.
We are relieved that the office will be properly prepared for when we decide to return.
Our Washington office is located at a WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all Washington employees.
Last week, our Washington office switched to a fully remote setup, in line with the guide shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we’re also discussing renting an office in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue to occur, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have been working remotely for a long time know that it can be an adjustment, and would like to offer some advice:
Limit the duration of meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider dividing them into several days.
Define the meeting, have a schedule and send materials for reading in advance.
Use videos as your default, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to make it easy to collaborate and connect in real time.
Have a leader to facilitate meetings, someone to monitor the questions in the chat and the list of participants, and someone to help make notes (or collaborative notes).
Send an email to technical support if you need comfortable headphones.
Use your emergency aid to buy snacks.
Join the #remotes channel to talk to your colleagues about remote work
The HR operations team is researching ergonomics guides in the context of the webinar to help increase remote work at the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all recipients of community aid to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as editing marathons, until the WHO declares an end to the pandemic.
We warn you that we understand that our cancellation request and other restrictions may make it impossible for you to complete your agreed-upon subsidy activities, and that no one would be penalized for extending or modifying your goals.
Next week, we will continue with additional guides on Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences.
The general feeling in the global community seems to be one of sadness at the shutdown, but also of relief at the clarity and ability to keep the focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and other situations.
The communication resources team is working on creating a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and receive our communications to it.
Staying up-to-date on COVID-19-related issues
We will send an invitation to your calendars for next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/ 07:00 PT for a special meeting with employees.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions and spend some time connecting with each other.
We're in this together and we'll help with whatever it takes.
In the meantime, you can continue to find the information in this email and all other information related to COVID-19 on the company's wiki.
The communication resources team will update these pages and all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with employees living in significantly affected countries today.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a main workflow, or about the coverage challenge, or anything else you may need help with, be sure to notify them and work with the communication resources team.
We are here to help provide support and collaboration as needed.
If you have a confidential or sensitive matter, send an email to Bryan Judah, Director of Global HR Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as abandoning our work and obligations.
They are, however, a recognition that, at this time, our work and obligations will probably need to adapt in a way that we have not adapted in the past.
These are the steps we believe are needed as support at this time, so that we can continue to work, providing our movement with the support it needs and providing the world with the service it depends on.
Our planned work will be waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it’s time to support each other and create space for the important work that will be done in the weeks, and probably months, to come.
We need all of you to make this happen, so we need all of you to take care of yourself and your family so that you are in your best condition when needed.
Wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, communication resources team (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
The angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme coupled to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines.
ECA2 neutralizes the activity of the related angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and elevating Ang (1-7), making it a promising drug aimed at treating cardiovascular diseases. ECA2 also functions as a point of entry into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hECA2.
The angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of the endothelial and other cells.
The ECA2 protein contains an N-terminal M2 peptidase domain and a C-terminal amino acid transporter domain and colectrine in the renal system.
ECA2 is a single-pass type 1 membrane protein, with its enzymatically active domain exposed on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in urine.
ECA2 is present in many organs: ECA2 is coupled to the cell membrane of major type II pulmonary alveolar cells, small intestine enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and arterial smooth muscle cells in most organs.
ECA2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The main function of ECA2 is to act as a counterweight to ECA.
ACE cleaves the hormone angiotensin type I to angiotensin type II causing vasoconstriction.
ECA2 in turn cleaves carboxyterminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis into vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Gist-Pro-H).
ECA2 also cleaves several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]- bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ECA2 also regulates the membrane transport of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been implicated in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ECA2 functions as the primary entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, binding of the spike protein S1 of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzyme domain of ECA2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of the virus and enzyme into endosomes located inside cells.
This input process also requires the preparation of protein S by the serine-protease host TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is under investigation as a potential therapy. This has led some to raise the hypothesis that reducing ECA2 levels in cells may help in fighting infection.
However, several professional societies and regulatory bodies recommended continuing the ACE inhibitor standard and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that “the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls.”
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at high risk of contracting pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with reduced pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less robust than for the overall risk of pneumonia."
Recombinant human ECA2 (rhACE2) is believed to be a novel therapy for acute lung injury, and appeared to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with a lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes after the temporal evolution of the effects (duration) of 24 hours.
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising medicine for those with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases in which circulating angiotensin II is elevated. Infused rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are mobile software applications to help monitoring in response to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people (“contacts”) who may have come into contact with infected individuals.
Numerous applications have been developed or proposed, with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several structures for creating contact monitoring applications have been developed.
Privacy issues have been raised, especially about systems based on tracking the geographical location of the users of the application.
Less intrusive alternatives include using Bluetooth signals to record the user’s proximity to other phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate the functionality to support such Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has implemented an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with a person carrying COVID-19.
It is in use in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was developed by the local IT community, released as open source and will be ceded to the government. North Macedonia has launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based app to track exposure to potentially infected people and offer a quick response to health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
Since April 14, 2020, the app has been awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government declared that the contact tracking app was in an advanced stage of development, and would be available for distribution in weeks. A similar app is planned for Ireland, and for France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand envision apps based on Singapore’s TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to implement a geographic delimitation app for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure they don’t leave home.
Ross Anderson, a security engineering professor at the University of Cambridge, listed a number of potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and the potential lack of effectiveness if the acceptance of the application is limited to only a small portion of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of fake or harmful coronavirus apps, Apple sets limits on the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related apps to its App Store, limiting them only to “official” or otherwise respected organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have expressed concern about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, especially about whether the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled when the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for limits on this type of surveillance.
The organizations declared eight conditions for government projects:
Surveillance should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
extensions of monitoring and surveillance would have to have suspension clauses;
the use of data should be limited for COVID-19 purposes;
the security and anonymity of data should be protected and presented as protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should prevent further discrimination and marginalisation;
any sharing of data with third parties should be provided for by law;
there should be safeguards against abuse and the rights of citizens to respond to abuse;
Significant participation of all "relevant stakeholders" would be required, including that of public health experts and marginalized groups. Germany's Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the persistent surveillance problem by removing the tracking mechanism from its device operating systems when it is no longer needed.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating the need to download an app and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking has been approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have considerable potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers need to have access to personal location data; a number of privacy-preserving systems have been created to use central servers only for intercommunication (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-application-based system was used to perform contact tracking.
Instead of using a unique app, the system gathered tracking information from multiple sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, combining them to generate text messages for potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential interlocutors, the government has also made location information publicly available, which is allowed due to sweeping changes to information confidentiality laws following the MERS outbreak in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of apps and websites. Countries, including Germany, consider using both the privacy preservation system and the centralized one.
As of April 6, 2020, the details had not yet been released.
Privacy-preserving contact tracking is a well-defined concept, with a significant body of scientific bibliography dating back to at least 2013. Since April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have been working on privacy-respecting solutions, with the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record a user’s proximity to other mobile devices.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that encompasses centralized and decentralized approaches, and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include Decentralized privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN) Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanism.
In these protocols, personally identifiable data never leaves the device, and any combination is made on the device.
The Privacy Group at the MIT Media Lab has developed Safe Paths, a platform for the use of privacy preservation techniques during collection and use of location data or path crossings to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the technical publication "Apps Play Dirty: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released in March 2020. Another similar effort is Enigma MPC's SafeTrace platform, a venture that develops privacy technologies and originally founded in the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to enable users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and managers, without compromising the privacy of that data.
On April 5, 2020, the TCN Global Coalition was founded by groups that united around what was essentially the same approach and largely with protocol overlap, with the goal of reducing fragmentation, and enabling global interoperability of alerting and tracking applications, a key aspect of achieving widespread adoption.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that the BlueTrace protocol, used by the government’s official app, had become open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracking, in which they claimed they would preserve privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and encryption for privacy preservation.
They also published specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system provides for implementation in three stages:
Development of tools to enable the government to create official coronavirus tracking apps while preserving privacy
Integrating this functionality directly into iOS and Android; Google and Apple plan to tackle persistent and assumed surveillance issues by first distributing the system by updating functioning systems, and later removing it in the same way as soon as the threat is over.
Drug repositioning (also known as drug repurposing, reprofiling, reassignment, or therapeutic substitution) is the repurposing of a drug approved for the treatment of a medical condition or disease other than the one for which it was originally developed.
This is one of the lines of scientific research that are currently being adopted to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research directions include the development of a convalescent plasma transfusion and vaccine for COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 drugable proteins, each with multiple binding points.
Analyzing these binding points provides the reasonable design of effective antiviral drug development against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, protein S, and ADP ribophosphatase.
Hussein A. A., et al., studied several candidate compounds that he then refined and analyzed for their structural similarities with the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent drug against SARS-CoV-2 in his pre-clinical study to be recommended for a clinical trial design.
Chloroquine is an anti-malarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that trials with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine from the state of New York would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate through an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA’s clinical trial process and is authorized through the AUE only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients who cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that "the use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" is not yet established.
Doctors said they are using the drug when “there is no other option.”
In Istanbul, a Turkish research team is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Major studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone School of Medicine is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to demonstrate that favipiravir was “clearly effective.”
In Shenzhen, 35 patients tested negative within 4 days on average, while the duration of the disease in the 45 patients who did not receive it was 11 days.
In a study conducted in Wuhan with 240 patients with pneumonia, half were treated with favipiravir, and half received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the population that the existing evidence to support the drug is scarce and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan to stock it and use the army to deliver it to university hospitals, where it would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has created openings for the Trump administration about buying the drug. The drug may be less effective in severe cases of the disease, when the virus has already multiplied.
Its use may not be safe for pregnant women or women trying to get pregnant.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antivirals lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefit was observed".
The drugs were developed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that binds to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. There is criticism in the scientific community about directing resources to reproposal drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences discovered after remdesivir showed in vitro antiviral activity against phylum, pneumo, paramyx and coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is resistance developed by mutations, which can cause more severe transmissions or diseases.
Some early pre-test studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are several ongoing clinical trials, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals, one for people with moderate disease and one for those with more severe disease.
There are three clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C occurring for hospitalized and severely ill people with COVID-19: two of them are placebo-controlled (in China and Canada), while the other does not have a control group (Italy).
The state of New York began testing azithromycin, an antibiotic, on March 24, 2020.
The National Center for Health and Global Medicine (NCGM) of Japan plans a clinical trial of Alvesco (cyclesonide), from the company Teijin, which is an inhalable corticosteroid for asthma. The goal is the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
Phase II of an angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 study is underway with 200 patients being recruited from hospitalized severe cases in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Heart Institute in Canada are currently investigating the role of colchicine in reducing lung complications and inflammation in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is recruiting 6,000 adults over the age of 40, diagnosed with COVID-19 and with mild symptoms, who did not need to be hospitalized.
Pregnant women, women who are breastfeeding or women who do not use effective contraception were not included in the tests.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is being widely used in the treatment of patients, which led the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study, with 300 patients, is analyzing the use of enoxaparin sodium in prophylaxis and therapeutic dosages. The study was announced on April 14, in Italy.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, the attention of the scientific community has been considerable to give new purpose to antiviral drugs approved and developed for the treatment of previous outbreaks, such as those of MERS, SARS and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as being capable of receiving a new purpose for the treatment of COVID-19 patients:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
There are also tests in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The vaccine for COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Although there is no vaccine with the clinical trials completed, there are several attempts underway to develop it.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, to be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in phase I of the safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
There was a large spread of the outbreak in 2020, which led to considerable investments and research activities for the development of a vaccine.
Several organizations are using published genomes for the development of possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The initiative of the Coalition for Innovations in Epidemic Preparedness, CEPI, declared in April that the needs for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale development and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported 10 diverse technology platforms being researched and developed during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The goals of the largest platforms that have advanced to phase I safety studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 of them confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute). Another 37 have been announced, but with little information available to the public (considered in planning or being projected).
A phase I-II test performs preliminary immunogenicity and safety testing. It is typically randomized, placebo controlled and multicenter, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III tests typically involve more participants in a control group. They test the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing the disease, while monitoring adverse effects at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 have not yet had an assessment in humans (continued in pre-clinical research).
On January 24, 2020, in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is investigating the potential of a vaccine with a molecular staple, which would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.
On January 24, 2020, in Canada, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announces the start of work on a vaccine, with the goal of testing in humans in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the China Center for Disease Prevention and Control on January 26, 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28.
On January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced the start of their work on developing a vaccine.
Janssen is co-developing an oral vaccine with its biotechnology partner Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a paper on the development of a vaccine with technology similar to that used for neoantigen vaccination therapy.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and were starting testing.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary company of Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that they were initiating a vaccine project to create a li-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested in humans “in the next 90 days.”
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced its plans to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Research Institute at Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced they were working on a vaccine.
Around March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it has joined Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners subsequently announced plans for pre-clinical testing and Phase I clinical studies in July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, India’s Ministry of Health announced that they are working with 11 isolates and, even at an accelerated pace, it would take at least a year and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, reported the development of a coronavirus-like particle under partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is in research in the lab, with human tests planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian stated that U.S. President Donald Trump offered CureVac “large sums of money for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine” under protest from the German government.
On March 17, 2020, pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
BNT162, an mRNA-based vaccine candidate, currently in preclinical testing, with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on March 17, 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company announced that it would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and its final vaccine candidate could leave for human trials in the fall.
In France, on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Innovations in Preparedness for Epidemic (CEPI) announced a $4.9 million investment in a research consortium for the COVID-19 vaccine involving the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, leading to CEPI’s total investment of 29 million in developing the vaccine for COVID-19.
The other CEPI investment partners for the development of the vaccine for COVID-19 are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six different vaccine candidates on animals.
Researchers at Imperial College in London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receipt of the sequencing from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced $275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan initiatives.
Nearly the same period, the Canadian government announced $192 million specifically to develop the vaccine for COVID-19, with plans to establish a national "vaccine bank" of several new vaccines that could be used if other outbreaks of the coronavirus occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine in rats, stating that "MNA delivered SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines that evoked potent antibody-specific responses to antigens [in the mouse] that were evident to have started 2 weeks after immunization."
In Canada on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the elaboration of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as possibly a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be planned to replicate within a human bacterium to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three U.S. universities pooled resources to access IBM supercomputers, in combination with cloud computing from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can have benefits beyond the disease it prevents.
A subsequent randomized trial in Australia is seeking to enroll 4,170 health care workers.
It is possible that vaccines in development are not safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the effectiveness of the vaccine using COVID-19-specific animal specimens, such as the ACE2-transgenic mouse, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, indicates a need for level 3 biosafety containment measures to manipulate live virus, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
SARS and MERS vaccines have already been tested in non-human animal specimens.
In 2020, there is no cure or vaccine that protects against SARS that has been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medications to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS became predominant, existing SARS research was believed to provide a useful model for vaccine development and therapeutic treatment against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one MERS (DNA-based) vaccine that completed phase I of clinical studies in humans, and three others in progress, all of which are virus-vectored vaccines, two with adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one vectorized by MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts promoted a conspiracy theory claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents cited by several social media publications indicate existing patents for gene sequences and vaccines for other Coronavirus strains such as Coronavirus SARS.
Betacoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome of Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is about 5 days, but can vary from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases had been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have already been cured. The virus is spread among people mainly during direct contact, usually through droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or speech.
Although these droplets are produced upon exhalation, they typically fall to the ground or stay on surfaces instead of remaining infectious over long distances.
People can also become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first 3 days after onset of symptoms, although spread may be possible before symptoms appear and at later stages of the disease.The standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal swab.
The use of masks is recommended for people with suspicion of the virus and for people responsible for its care.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the general population vary, where some authorities recommend not to use, some recommend the use and others force the use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease was recorded in most countries by all six WHO regions.
Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms, cough, fatigue, and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, difficulty staying awake, bluish face or lips.
Less common, upper respiratory tract symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat can be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea were observed in different percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented only tightness in the chest and palpitations.
In some, the disease can progress to pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will develop them within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected will develop symptoms.
The role that these asymptomatics play in transmission is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not have symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, and the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their hospital stay.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1; of the 166 infections on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Sputum and saliva can carry large viral loads.
Speaking loudly releases more droplets than speaking normally.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without covering the mouth can cause the droplets to reach 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually carried by air, the National Academy of Science has suggested that transmission by bioaerosol may be possible and air collectors positioned in corridors outside people’s rooms contained positive samples for a viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can generate respiratory secretions that will be aerosolized and therefore transmitted through the air.
Although there is concern that it can be transmitted through stool, the risk is believed to be low. The virus is most contagious when people are symptomatic. Although it is possible to have transmission before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease is spread, a person usually infects one or two. The virus survives for hours or days on surfaces.
Specifically, it was found that the virus was detectable for one day in cardboard, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and up to four hours in 99% copper.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if used correctly. Products with soap degrade the protective lipid envelope of the virus, disabling it, in addition to removing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine glyconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were collected on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load, while the sixth patient had the highest viral load on the second day tested.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus that was first isolated in three people with pneumonia who were related to a group of cases of acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All the features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in nature, in related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus dies in contact with household soap, which breaks its protective layer. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses the host cells through the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2), which is most abundant in the alveolar type II cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spicle" (peplomer) to connect to the ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute cardiac injury was observed in 12% of infected people who were hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and is more frequent in the severe disease.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is high thanks to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the course of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections and may be related to poor prognosis. Necropsies of people who died due to COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has tropism for respiratory tract epithelial cells expressing ACE2, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic T cells secreting GM-CSF have been shown to correlate with recruitment of IL-6-secreting inflammatory monocytes and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltrators have also been reported in necropsy.
The WHO has published several protocols for testing for the disease.
The standard test method is the polymerase chain reaction via real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually done on respiratory samples obtained through a nasopharyngeal swab, however, a nasal swab or cold sample may be used.
Results are usually available in a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but for this it is necessary to collect two blood samples two weeks apart and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a coronavirus strain and publish its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, tests using antibodies (which can detect active infections and whether a person has been infected in the past) were in development, but have not yet been widely used.
The experience of the Chinese with the test showed that its accuracy is 60 to 70%.
The U.S. FDA approved the first remote laboratory test on March 21, 2020, for use later that month. Diagnostic guidelines released by Wuhan University’s Zhongnan Hospital suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical resources and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobed frosted glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are common at the beginning of infection.
Subpleural dominance, mosaic paving (thickened lobular septa with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.
There is little data available on microscopic lesions and COVID-19 pathophysiology.
The main pathological findings during autopsies are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary edema
Four types of viral pneumonia severity can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, atypical large pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxia.
treated pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding places with many people, frequently washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, as well as covering the mouth with the inner side of the elbow if the tissue is not available.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is encouraged.
The CDC recommended the use of cloth masks in public places, in part to limit transmission by asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce the contact of infected people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and canceling large public meetings.
Distance guidelines also include people staying at least 1.8 meters (6 feet) apart from each other.
An effective drug for preventing COVID-19 is not known. Since the vaccine should not be launched before 2021, a key point for COVID-19 control is to try to decrease the peak of the epidemic, also known as "curve flattening".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently using soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when their hands are visibly dirty, before eating, and after blowing their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
It also recommends using alcohol-based hand antiseptic with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available. For places where commercial hand antiseptics are not readily available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity occurs through ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is not "an active substance for hand asepsis."
Glycerol is added as a humidifier.
People are treated through palliative care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support for other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect they have the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under analysis.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet are being recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive treatments may be useful for those with mild symptoms and in the early stages of infection. The WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensivists and pulmonologists in the U.S. have gathered treatment recommendations from several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
Until April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risks of transmission of the virus, especially in the health environment, when performing procedures that can generate aerosols, such as intubation and manual ventilation.
For healthcare professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in rooms with airborne infection isolation (IAIS) in addition to taking standard precautions, contact precautions, and aerial precautions. The CDC summarizes the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: PPE blanket, respirator or face mask, visual protection and medical gloves. When available, it is preferable to use respirators instead of face masks.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA has authorized the masks for use under Emergency Use Authorization (USA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for uses not described.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of face shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory support for individuals with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being studied for people in hospitals, with some evidence that intubation can be prevented with a high-flow nasal cannula or positive airway pressure at two levels.
Whether either of these two leads to the same benefits for people who are seriously ill is unknown.
Some doctors prefer to stay with invasive mechanical ventilation when it is available because this technique limits the aerosol particles to spread, compared to the high-flow nasal cannula. Severe cases are more common in the elderly (those over 60 years and especially over 80 years).
Many developing countries do not have sufficient hospital beds per capita, which limits the ability of the health system to cope with the sudden escalation in the number of COVID-19 cases severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China noted that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people in the hospital with COVID-19 were eventually taken to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Fans that have pressure control mode and high PEEP level are needed to increase oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of lung and pneumothorax injuries associated with ventilation.
High level of PEEP may not be available on older fans.
Research for potential treatments began in January 2020 and clinical trials are underway with several antiviral drugs.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
While new drugs may take until 2021 to be developed, several of the drugs tested have already been approved for other uses or are in the advanced testing phase.
Antiviral medication can be tested on people with various diseases.
The WHO recommended that volunteers take part in testing the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has given temporary authorization for the use of plasma from convalescent people as treatment in cases where the person’s life is serious and immediately threatened.
The clinical studies necessary to show its safety and effectiveness against the disease have not yet been carried out.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users are asked to provide their name and ID number.
The app can detect the “near contact” using monitoring data and thus the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends quarantine but also warns local health authorities. Big data analyses of mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are being used to track infected people and the people they have had contact with in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorized security agencies to track mobile phone data of people who are allegedly with coronavirus.
The move was taken to strengthen the quarantine and protect people who may come into contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated phone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to research and prevent transmission of the virus.
Russia has implemented facial recognition technology to detect who breaches the quarantine.
Italy’s regional health commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said he was told by cellphone operators that “40% of people continue to circulate anyway.”
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackathon over the weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid made a global appeal for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may experience difficulties in quarantine, travel restrictions, treatment side effects, or fear of the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O’Connor, who said: “Increased social isolation, loneliness, medical anxiety, stress and an economic crisis are a perfect storm to harm people’s mental health and well-being.”
The disease may have a mild evolution, with few or no symptoms, resembling other common diseases of the upper respiratory tract, such as the cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical illness may take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk of serious COVID-19 infection, according to data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but COVID-19 data are lacking. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs, causing pneumonia.
In those most severely affected, COVID-19 can progress rapidly to adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, clotting disorders, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Coagulation disorders, specifically the increase in prothrombin time, were described in 6% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, while renal failure was seen in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people who have COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five hospitalizations.
However, patients transferred to an ICU had a median of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study with early cases, the median manifestation of initial symptoms until death was 14 days, with a total interval of six to 41 days.
In a study by China’s National Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8 percent, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7 percent.
Histopathological examinations of post-mortem lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The imaging of the lung looked like acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by China’s National Health Commission, heart damage was detected due to elevated troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalized patients had pre-existing comorbidities. The availability of medical resources and socioeconomic factors in a region can also affect mortality.
Estimates of comorbidity mortality vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The underreporting of mild cases can cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.
However, the fact that the deaths are the result of cases contracted in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to need intensive treatment or die, compared to non-smokers. Concerns were raised about long-term sequelae of the disease.
The Hong Kong hospital authority noted a 20-30% drop in lung capacity in some people who have recovered from the disease, and lung tests indicated organ damage.
This can also lead to intensive post-care syndrome after recovery.
Until March 2020, it was not known whether past infections would give effective and lasting immunity to people who have recovered from the disease.
Immunity is seen as probable, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases where recovery from COVID-19 was followed by positive tests for coronavirus at a later date have been reported.
These cases are believed to be the worsening of a prolonged infection rather than a reinfection.
The virus is believed to be natural and of animal origin, through overflow infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, the spread of infection has become almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed that the earliest date of onset of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications reported the earliest date of onset of symptoms as December 8, 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time elapsed since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and health in general.
At the end of 2019, the WHO assigned the ICD-10 emergency disease codes U07.1 for deaths resulting from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from COVID-19 with clinical or epidemiological diagnosis, without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The mortality rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given interval.
Based on statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the global lethality rate was 6.9% (153.822/2.240.191) on April 17, 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measures include the case-fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of individuals diagnosed who die from a disease, and the infection-fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of individuals infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not restricted to time and track a specific population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can give information about how many people have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small town of 4,600, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread by Carnival festivals and spread among younger people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all COVID-19 deaths should have been formally recorded as such.
In addition, the German healthcare system was not overburdened.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, as verified in blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) had confirmed death from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, with the difference between men and women approaching only 90.
In China, the death rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact reasons for the difference between the sexes are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reason.
Immune differences by sex, lower prevalence of female smokers, and the development by men of comorbidities such as hypertension at a younger age than women may have contributed to higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men, and 72% of those killed by COVID-19 were men.
Until April 2020, the U.S. government was not tracking data on sex-related COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women in different ways.
A higher percentage of health workers, mainly nurses, are women, and they are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020, that the official name of the disease was "COVID-19".
The head of WHO, Tedros Adhanon Ghebreyesus, explained that "CO" is from "crown", "VI", "virus", "D", disease and "19" is from when the outbreak was identified: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g.: China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 was called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses “the COVID-19 virus” and “the virus responsible for COVID-19” in communications to the public.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly called "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly called "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended "2019-nCov" and "2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease" as interim names for the virus and disease, according to the 2015 guidance against the use of sites in the name of diseases and viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing healthcare materials such as nasopharyngeal thrushes and respirator parts.
In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a respirator valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver on the necessary schedule, a local startup reverse-engineered and printed the 100 valves needed overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation, and misinformation about the origin, size, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease quickly spread across the Internet.
Apparently, humans are able to transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study could not find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicine or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19 is ongoing in government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the SOLIDARITY Trial to assess the effects of treatment with four existing antiviral components with more likely efficacy.
No vaccine is available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies being investigated.
First, the researchers aim to develop a vaccine with the whole virus.
The use of this virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to provoke a rapid immune response of the human body to a new COVID-19 infection.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the spicle protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for creating vaccines).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should have safety and efficacy tested. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent enhancement has been pointed out as a possible challenge for the development of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
There are more than 300 clinical trials underway since April 2020.
Seven trials evaluated treatments already approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The redirection of antiviral drugs makes up most of the Chinese research, with nine phase III clinical trials of remdesivir in several countries due to a report from the end of April.
A dynamic analysis of the clinical development of COVID-19 drug and vaccine candidates was underway in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for COVID-19 treatment, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
There has been an attempt to prove the effectiveness of remdesivir since March 2020.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remdesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine, already used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there are requests for peer review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, warns that twice that dose is highly dangerous and can be lethal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating people with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended to be further studied in vivo after demonstrating low inhibitory concentration of SARS-CoV-2.Studies have shown that the initial spicle protein in preparation by the transmembrane protease of serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for SARS-CoV-2 entry through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have great limitations that have prevented the medical community from adopting these therapies without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known function in the treatment of COVID-19.
The cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-storm properties of cytokine. Tocilzumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after the conclusion of a small study.
A non-randomized phase 2 national level test is underway in Italy, after having demonstrated positive results in people with the severe disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine storms, it is expected to neutralize these developments, which are considered the cause of death for some affected people.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies on the treatment of steroid-refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
So far, there is no controlled, randomized evidence that tocilzumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system from those who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccine method of passive immunization.
This strategy was tested for SARS, with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy can mediate a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms, however, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in development.
The production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid portion of blood from recovered patients and contains antibodies specific for this virus, could be increased for faster implementation.
