Inflation in Europe has slipped on food
Accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid rise in food prices.
In November, the price increase in the 13 euro area countries was larger than expected, after an inflation rate of 2.6 per cent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent was recorded, said the European Community statistics office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts indicated only 3 percent, Bloomberg said.
Unlike the U.S., British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the policy interest rate by saying that falling interest rates, along with rising commodity prices and falling unemployment, would lead to the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below but close to two percent.
According to one analyst, it is catch 22 for the ECB: "we must deter" inflation so that we no longer have to intervene on this subject later.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 per cent is a record over the last twelve years and in Spain it has risen from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has taken off due to the rapid rise in food and energy prices.
Cereal futures market shares increased by 88 percent and soybean prices also reached their highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also increased significantly in 2007.
This year, the world oil price rose by 52 percent, and last month, a barrel of black gold cost nearly $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008 the inflation rate will rise from 2.1 per cent this year to 2.5 per cent, but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9 per cent.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3 percent, however, for the next 3 to 4 months, the annual average rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to lower the policy rate twice in 2008.
Gallup warns of government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of supporters of the Fidesz (Alliance of Young Democrats) increased significantly at the beginning of December, so since 2002, it currently has the largest number of supporters, while Gallup (Survey Institute) has never before seen such low socialist support, namely 13 percent.
For loyal voters, the difference would represent, due to the greater determination of the opposition voters, a support of more than two-thirds (71 percent) against the support of a fifth (20 percent) for the MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the poll, the MDF (Hungarian Democratic Forum) and the SZDSZ (Alliance of Free Democrats) are below the threshold of parliamentarians: their support is two percent across the population.
On faithful voters certain to go and vote, the number of supporters of both parties increased by 1 percent.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate compared to the previous low point, the proportion of those who considered the economic situation in the country to be particularly dire has never been higher, it rises to 41 per cent and according to 46 per cent additionally the situation is quite dire.
After the more optimistic prospects of last spring and summer, families are once again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For next year, the majority of the population expects a worsening and only a tenth expects an improvement in the situation.
Last December, 71 percent of those surveyed, a majority never seen in Gallup’s previous polls, said the prime minister was doing his job rather badly than well.
13 percent of respondents have confidence or a lot of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcs<0xC3><0xA1>ny while 38 percent support Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n.
54 percent do not trust the prime minister at all and 27 percent do not trust the president of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the change in the political situation is the proportion of society that believes that discontent with the Prime Minister can be addressed without a change in government.
While after the October riots, 35 per cent of respondents wanted the government and the prime minister to remain in office, this rate currently stands at only 20 per cent, with the relative majority (33 per cent) believing that holding new elections would be the solution to this situation.
When asked about the intention to vote, 60 percent of respondents said they would certainly vote and the additional 20 percent said they would probably vote.
To make the comparison, for a "legislative election to be held next Sunday", only 55 percent of the respondents would certainly participate and 15 percent would probably supplement them. According to current intentions, the result of the referendum would be in no doubt.
74 percent of people would say no to enrolment fees in higher education, 79 percent would say no to consultation fees and 84 percent would say no to hospital stay fees.
When we look only at the same proportions among people who expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, respectively 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of registration fees, consultation fees and hospital stay fees.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has raised its prices by almost twenty percent
The hypermarkets in Budaörs' commercial triangle maintained last year's average price increase of 16 percent, with the difference that this year's VAT rate did not rise.
Article by Napi Gazdas<0xC3><0xA1>g (Daily Economy)
This year, in the Budaörs trade triangle, the usual daily Christmas basket also increased by an average of 16 percent, a value increase of well over a thousand forints was displayed in all hypermarkets.
Prices, "which had already soared" in grocery stores last December, did not rise sharply from the previous high base.
Nonetheless, consumers are obviously shocked to see that items purchased significantly below nine thousand forints last year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The daily shopping basket in the surveyed hypermarkets exceeded the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
And the highest value of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6,800 forints.)
Prices for Unicum and live fish remained almost at last year's level, but prices for turkey fillet, nuts and poppy have risen sharply.
In the stores, the price of flour and bread followed the data of the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) but, in Auchan, bread was found from one kilo to only 139 forints.
Competition did not lower the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was amazing to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the two-litre bottle of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so it only cost 257 forints per bottle of Coca-Cola included.
However, this year, in terms of Daily Basket, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of its Daily Basket by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan increased them by about 18 and 18 percent respectively.
Comparing last year's most expensive basket with this year's cheapest basket, we see a gap of 12 percent while the difference between last year's cheapest and this year's most expensive is 21 percent.
Prices increased by an average of 1,480 forints.
Last year, prices rose by an average of 1,206 forints, knowing that the impact of the VAT rate increase was already being noticed in last year's Christmas prices.
This process perplexed trade, as hypermarkets could not visibly determine which margin to apply to products because they were unable to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a trader miscalculates the rotation of a product, he risks losing a large profit on the margin adapted to the intensity of the trade.)
Due to the change in the VAT rate, the daily basket price increase has evolved so excessively that the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints higher than the value of the 2006 one, while the difference between the cheapest baskets was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so excessive since the value of the most expensive basket was 1,630 forints higher than last year and the prices of the cheapest forint increased by 1,284 forints as well.
As we approached the two Christmas seasons, we saw a catastrophic increase in prices, in less than 20 months the prices of everyday consumer items increased by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm the KSH data: for some basic supplies, the Institute of Statistics has observed a price increase of more than 30 per cent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, with flour and egg.)
According to the Daily Basket of the latter, this seems almost absurd since the price level of this product, already very expensive last year, has increased by just more than 10 percent compared to the base.
According to the indices, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than egg suppliers because they have managed to make the sudden increase in prices also accepted by multinationals.
In the commercial golden triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they constantly record good years.
In our experience, the majority of customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take long-preserved foods by pallets.
On Wednesday morning, important queues were formed at the checkouts of the three hypermarkets as the number of customers increased sharply.
However, according to our information, the turnover is less important in the province, many multinationals complain to the survey companies that they do not even reach the expected turnover, not only for food but also for articles of sustainable consumption.
Many hospitals are saving on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, mainly caused by the incorrect use of antibiotics, have been registered in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the overwork of medical staff do not help to block infections, says the chief doctor of the National Center for Epidemiology.
Many hospitals are also saving on disinfectants
Not long ago a MRSA infection was diagnosed in the traumatology department of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Hospital.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was detected in a man hospitalized following a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The person injured in a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital but soon after had to return to the hospital due to a MRSA infection and, since then, doctors have not been able to perform a major operation because of the bacteria in his body.
Until 10 December this year, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multi-resistant pathogen were reported to the National Hospital Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, chief physician at the National Epidemiology Centre.
To know that it is the number of infections caused by a multi-resistant pathogen that has actually been registered in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
Approximately two-thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. methicillin-oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
A third of people carry the Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without it developing a disease.
Infections caused by AS (such as angina, tonsillitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) react well to antibiotics, they are easily curable.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacterium, which reacts well to antibiotics, will develop a well-resistant bacterium that will proliferate quickly in poor hospital conditions.
In case of temporary or prolonged malfunction of the immune system, this bacterium can cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or sepsis, in elderly, underweight or weakened patients.
According to the head doctor of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the daily lives of hospitals.
We should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, we do not find MRSA only the one where we do not look for them, said Tibor Nyulasi.
SAs are resistant to antibiotics.
“These patients are isolated, the caregivers put on rubber gloves and protective masks and we have antibiotics adapted to treat them,” said Tibor Nyulasi.
A priori, hospitalized patients are examined if they are MRSA carriers, however infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling is not fashionable
The vast majority of infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but current conditions and circumstances in Hungarian hospitals are not conducive to preventing the development and proliferation of multidrug-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection is most common in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should monitor hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients with MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that the National Social Security Fund does not fund these examinations.
Most cases arise only if the MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, said the chief doctor of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has stringent recommendations for the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian guidelines for the cure of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts must be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, in other words microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take this into account.
Microbiological sampling is even rarer in outpatient care and basic care, said Karolina Böröcz.
Many hospitals are saving on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA proliferates from one patient to another most often through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash your hands, put on gloves and protective masks, but important gaps are detected in hospitals also in this area.
MRSAs proliferate by infection transmitted by inhalation of droplets and by contact. However, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other while in terms of epidemic, the patients should be at least 1.5 meters away from each other.
Unfortunately, we also find that hospitals, in a difficult financial situation, are saving on disinfectants, they lack nurses, there are many sick people, so the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals where preventive measures are followed, the number of infections is demonstrably lower or the proliferation of the pathogen can be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection is an exorbitant expense for social security funds, which is why this infection is being fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSA.
According to published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has identified the prevention of the incidence of multidrug-resistant pathogens (such as MRSA) as well as the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens as one of its priorities.
The Commissioner, the author of a fatal accident, was not intoxicated.
The official statement regarding the fatal accident caused by the Commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement has been drawn up.
It can be excluded that the commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement, resigning from his post since, who crushed a pedestrian causing his death last Tuesday, would have driven in a state of drunkenness or dizziness, Attila Morvai, spokesman for the public prosecutor's office of the capital, said Friday after the relative finding was established.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation, which already found that the former commissioner had not consumed alcohol before he got behind the wheel.
Last Tuesday, the former head of the police station in the 22nd arrondissement crushed a 55-year-old man who was in front of him when he turned, with his personal car, in Kossuth Lajos street in the 22nd arrondissement. The man wanted to cross the road by not passing through the pedestrian crossing.
(By the way, the fact that he crossed the road outside the pedestrian crossing is not an extenuating circumstance, according to the Highway Code a car that starts a turn must let pedestrians pass.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
Following this accident, the Commissioner resigned from his position and requested his retirement because, according to the police communication, this accident upset him a lot.
The investigation into this case is being conducted by the Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former commissioner cooperated from the beginning with the magistrates in charge of the investigation.
Additional €400 million for infrastructure
J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres, Minister of Finance of Hungary, and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed on Friday in Budapest three agreements with a total value of 400 million euros for a credit line to support education, transport and environment infrastructure as well as energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for the Hungarian budgetary financing of transport and environmental projects to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund, of which a credit agreement worth EUR 100 million has already been signed by the parties. This time, the contract signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The agreement on the €150 million credit also concerns the budgetary financing of education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of €300 million for Hungary, with the remaining €150 million to be used later following the extension of the credit agreement.
The parties have signed a contract of 50 million euros for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope in the first place as part of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
During the negotiations, the metro line 4 project was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would re-discuss the possible modification of the original contract when Hungary finalises the details of the financing of the metro with the EU.
According to J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has granted a total of EUR 8.4 billion to finance 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants its loans at the interest rate linked to EURIBOR, with a grace period of 8 years and without commitment fees.
Bulgaria, a paradise for the EU real estate market
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of the whole of Europe is turned to this country of the Balkans little mentioned in the past.
What, or and who bought in this EU market which is always the cheapest but which will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Currently, in real estate, Bulgaria is unquestionably the most fashionable target in Eastern Europe with its cheap ski apartments and seaside houses.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, by the sea, Albéna, the "Golden Sands", the "Sun Coast", the ancient Sozopol and Nessebar but they are increasingly looking for a building in the Kavarna and Balcik region as well.
According to analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also arouse the interest of investors and they are also more and more to buy in the very cheap corner of Ruse.
Sofia, the capital, also offers attractive opportunities, with retail and office areas promising the highest depreciation rate.
Bulgaria is on track to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe and thus be a priority destination, after the summer and winter season, also in the other two seasons of the year.
More vigilant investors already buy in large numbers, for example in the corner of Bansko.
According to analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria are looking at the same time to change their life, their way of life.
Most of the buyers are English but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
There are also Maltese and Cypriot investors. On the shores of the Black Sea and in the most famous ski resorts, we traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People planning to settle buy renovated buildings, at a price ranging from 50 to 100 thousand euros, or old dilapidated houses, at a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication possibilities, proximity to a large city, shops and in general that of the local doctor.
The second group includes buyers of second homes (since last December, Bulgaria is listed among the top 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group is made up of commercial investors who buy in the hope of achieving medium- or long-term gains.
The price of buildings in the capital is constantly increasing due to an increasing demand.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria. However, in the last 5 years they have increased by 21 percent each year.
The increase in real estate prices essentially exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the Six Percent Hungarians
According to the communication of G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, the meetings of the professionals are concluded on Tuesday, however, Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of the ministers on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Roadmap to define the efforts to be made after the Kyoto Protocol emission reduction period until 2012.
At the moment, there are intense discussions on this issue between developing and developed countries.
The United States also reported that, at the moment, it did not want to discuss exact figures, while it was ready to sign an agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 percent from the 1990 level until 2020.
Another important topic of the conference is whether developed countries are committed, apart from emission reductions, to providing financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was also signed on aid to developing countries.
The aid fund defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a 16-member board of directors, likely under the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), Piac és Profit (Market and Profit) said.
6 percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, confirms the EU's ambition to retain its role as flagship in global efforts to protect the climate and encourage the signing of the new international agreement by 2009.
The minister explained that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent from 1990 levels by 2020, regardless of the successful signing of the “Post-2012 Agreement”, and is ready to reduce them by up to 30 per cent if other major regions of the world and/or developing countries are also ready to make commitments tailored to their responsibilities.
G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the signatory countries of the Kyoto Protocol had aimed for a total reduction of 5.2 per cent and all 15 EU members at that time made the commitment by 8 per cent less.
Hungary has made a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to the level of the period between 1985 and 1987, our country will fulfill its commitment, recalls the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The stakes are high in Bali because the long-term international agreement on climate policy must be put in place within two years, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be postponed after 2012. In this case, the pledges of reduction below the values envisaged in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system whose need was underlined in the new IPCC report.
The reduction of emissions would be delayed and the increase in the average temperature of the Earth of more than 2 degrees celcius could no longer be avoided, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
British Army recruits on YouTube
British army units are sharing footage from their operations in Iraq and Afghanistan on the video-sharing site with the aim of becoming popular.
First, it is the British Air Force (RAF) that has become passionate about YouTube: special units operating in Afghanistan upload video footage of operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reported.
These recordings, taken using miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are monitored at Air Force Operations Headquarters in Kandahar and are then transferred to London or uploaded by compatriots to the Internet.
The political message is unavoidable
Air force soldiers have already passed 139 sequences on the net through this channel and their "chain" has been watched by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence signed up under the name "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and is sharing videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan while the Commonwealth Office and the International Peacekeeping Forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own channels on YouTube.
Mission in Afghanistan
According to the initial objective of the air force, the videos were passed on the net to recruit. According to the Ministry of Defence, they also served to make the public aware of the real objectives of the presence of the army abroad.
The propaganda published through this channel costs almost nothing compared to the usual recruitment advertisements on television, Gordon Mackenzie, a defence consultant, told BBC News, but it also inevitably carries a political message since it justifies in a special way the merits of the military operations decided by the government.
The Americans played a game.
The army is annoyed because, apart from the carefully composed and censored videos, amateur videos are passed on the sharing site that also present, for example, the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a little hypocritical, the officers do not avoid talking about the losses but they never present the bloody side of the fight.
In fact, many videos had already been passed on the net showing the areas of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that were carried out on a real mission, but the British military has only recently become excited about uploading these videos.
The Americans do the recruitment a little differently by using the free downloadable shooting game America's Army. In this game the player can put himself directly in the place of the soldiers as part of a simulation more or less real.
Christmas raffle and donuts in ministries
Labour Minister M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth does not seem sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold a year-end meeting with her co-workers who will be able to say goodbye to the year 2007 by having donuts and coffee.
Another ministry will host a party with live music, yet another will enchant officials with a raffle and offer a drink to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet, so the power is entertained.
The public authorities are also preparing Christmas.
This year, the largest Christmas party will be organized by the Ministry of Defence, but it will not be the employees of the Ministry who will be invited.
At Christmas, the children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts, for the missionary Christmas, family members of the soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The ministry plans a budget of 25 million forints to create the end-of-year mood.
In comparison with other ministries, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will celebrate.
The GKM party will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320,000 forints and, of the six hundred employees in bulk, three hundred and fifty are expected.
At this party, the Christmas atmosphere will be rigorous, there will be actors and also a raffle.
The NFÜ Christmas has cost 4,700,000 forints and was held Wednesday in the building of the National Council of Justice (ILO) with concerts and a dinner.
The rental of the room cost a million forints, the rest was spent on the more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a service of the NFÜ is invited to another Christmas party that is organized with European money by the National Center for Economic Development, a company that manages tenders.
The building of the Thé<0xC3><0xA2>tre de la Ga<0xC3><0xAE>té was rented for these purposes.
This information was not confirmed by MAG Zrt because we were unable to reach the person responsible.
Costume is not mandatory
The ILO building hosted not only the NFÜ but also the Ministry of Justice and Police which, instead of a Christmas party, organized a ball on the occasion of St. Luca on 7 December.
The ILO did not charge them for the use of its rooms.
There were five hundred people at the ball.
The party began with the minister’s words of welcome and the dinner was followed by a dancing evening on live music.
Answer to [origo]'s question: Evening dress was not at all mandatory at this ball.
The Ministries of Health, Labour and Local Government are preparing a sober celebration.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and a party for its employees, inside its walls, for 400,000 forints.
On the other hand, M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not officially invite her employees to a Christmas party but to a working meeting at the end of the year.
One hundred and eighty people are expected who will be invited to have a coffee and eat donuts, the press service said, the party will cost only 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Government, will simply invite his employees to have a drink in the classroom of the Ministry of Local Government and Planning.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will organize a Christmas party in its large hall at which 436 employees are expected.
He plans to spend 2,500 forints per guest including a buffet and a drink.
Since the arrival of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres, the employees of the PM celebrate Christmas every year in the same way.
No party atmosphere planned, the official character is reinforced not only by the presentation of the minister but also by the time of the party taking place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will host a reception on January 20 to celebrate the New Year, the Christmas party will not take place.
The reception will be held at Vajdahunyad Castle, located in the City Woods, and according to the ministry’s communication, 1,000 forints per person are calculated for the hundred guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, held every year, are started by a few words of welcome from the minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture are not celebrating Christmas at all, the respective press services told [origo].
The press service of the Ministry of the Environment did not know the official Christmas holiday prize.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the party organized at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The forces of the mega strike are gathering
The unions of the League and the National Association of Workers' Councils will form, on Friday, their strike commission that will be responsible for coordinating Monday's indefinite strike.
On Saturday, a general assembly of protest will be held and on Monday, the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause major traffic jams because rail traffic will be stopped almost completely and the employees of BKV (public transport company) will also strike until 13h.
The unions of the league will make known, Friday afternoon, the details of their strike on Monday, organized with the National Association of Workers' Councils.
The strike committee of LIGA - MOSZ will also be constituted, it will serve as coordinator of Monday's actions.
On Saturday, a general assembly of protest will be held, and as of Monday, organizations joining the strike will stop work for an indefinite period if they fail to reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of the vote in parliament on the law on health insurance, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not pass the Health Funds Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for strikes.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide what action to take.
According to the Monday agenda of the National Assembly, it is likely that the vote on the Health Funds Act will take place only late at night, or even at night.
Due to the planned strike on Monday, major traffic jams are planned: the railways will stop work for an indefinite period and during the morning part of public transport in Budapest and more than half of the Vol<0xC3><0xA1>n companies are at risk of being stopped.
At the same time, at different points in the country, half of the road will also be blocked.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the call for strikes, the list of which is constantly updated on the League's website.
Some organizations report going on strike for an indefinite period, others have declared a temporary work stoppage.
Until Thursday afternoon, the M<0xC3><0x81>V (Hungarian Railways) and the Free Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) failed to reach an agreement on minimum services, and as the Christmas holidays approach, more and more people are taking the train.
According to current communications, public transport in Budapest will strike from the start of service until 1 pm, the airport in Budapest between 7 am and 9 am, the Industrial Unions of Electricity and Thermal Energy of the League will strike for four hours, the Teachers' Union and the Democratic Teachers' Union have called for strikes for 2 hours and from 2 to 8 hours respectively.
The National Association of Physicians will strike across the country alternately, the Health and Social Sector Employees Union (EDDSZ) attached to the SZEF will strike a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands, made by the League, requires the government to withdraw its proposal on health reform and submit a new conception to the social debate.
The second claim requires that the new method of calculating the pension to be implemented from next year be introduced in several steps.
The third claim calls for a guarantee, in terms of retirement before the legal age, which would allow the system to transfer the functions that deserve it before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ), attached to the Unions of the League, of the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport regarding secondary railway lines and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increased Country Risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital (Risk Analysis Division), the activity of the Hungarian Guard, formed last August, with the support of the Jobbik Magyarorsz<0xC3><0xA1>gért Mozgalom (Movement for a Better Hungary) increases, in several aspects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its “risk warning”, the company points out that, in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is already that “in the short term aggressive ethnic clashes may occur following the worsening of the already existing ethnic tension between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy population of Hungary”.
The research institute added that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy likely aimed at provoking this situation is the main reason.
As they say, this is explained by one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors: “public actors passed the public debate on the Roma case to representatives of radical and extreme political groupings who based a political strategy on the dispute between Gypsies and Hungarians.”
The problem is aggravated, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are strengthened and the arrival of aggressive conflicts is more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, under the effect of the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media, the activity of the Hungarian Guard "has significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, especially regarding confidence in the stability and democratic maturity of the country".
They recall that, following greater publicity given to the reorganization of Hungarian radical and far-right groups since the fall of 2006, many associations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007 giving themselves the name of "national self-defense association".
“The common feature of these rallies is that they define themselves as a civilian organization while publicly declaring the preparation of their members for defense missions (catastrophes, national defense, defense of order), armed if necessary, in addition, referring to the incapacity of the police, the army, in other words the state,” they added.
They pointed out that everything was going according to the method that, based on the grudge of the political society and the parties, seeks to disguise different political ambitions from a civil aspect.
The emphasis on civility and association status therefore serves only to avoid the legal pitfalls of registering these associations in court, but they also constitute a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that also increases the risk compared to neighboring relations.
“In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk and ultra-nationalist political actors in some neighbouring countries want to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the Hungarian Guard’s constitution.
This influences the political stability of the region,” they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Eastern Central Europe, political risks have increased across the region.
As they say, the functioning of the Hungarian Guard resembles, for example, the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The numerous Roma unrest that erupted in a district of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) is at the origin of the constitution of the Bulgarian guard.
Taking advantage of these events, the UNB decided to form a guard, saying that the organization's objective is "national self-defense".
According to them, in the last 17 years, the Gypsies have “terrorized” Bulgaria but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls the Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had sparked lively debates in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement by some Bulgarian Roma organizations regarding the formation of their own guard as a form of resistance signals the increased risk of ethnic clashes.
The operation of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities to that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not exclude that the Hungarian Roma react to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defense, the Political Capital risk warning reads.
Attila Juh<0xC3><0xA1>sz, director of research at Political Capital, said: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published every year and if events occur that could have an impact on the change in risk, they inform the public, as in this case, by issuing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the holidays and, around the holidays, it has become common to reorganize the working days whose number will decrease next year.
The holidays are not uniform in the EU and the US either.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes between national and state holidays as well as rest days.
Days of rest are often linked to religious holidays or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the New Year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the new year are also days of rest, the latter all the more so that the holidaymakers can rest quietly.
In addition, in a year, we have a total of eleven parties marked in red.
March 15 is a national holiday, commemorating the revolution of 1848, as is October 23, which is also the commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrate the constitution of our state, May 1st is Labor Day and November 1st and 2nd, we remember our deceased family members and friends.
In addition, we have two days at Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
The days of our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, depending on the calendar, it has become common to reorganize the working days in cases where there is only one working day left before or after the holiday marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price for extended weekends by working or going to school on the Saturday before the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has ruled in a special regulation on the replacement days of the days before or after the holidays.
The law extends to all employers and all their employees, to civil servants and to persons working in the public service.
It does not, however, apply to service companies, institutions operating without interruption and in service, by their vocation, and also for days of rest.
This year, working days will be changed only around the end of the year holidays: from December 24, life stops almost all over the country because according to experiences the majority of people rather do overtime or take holidays that they have saved for these purposes to be able to spend the days between Christmas and New Year's Day at home.
Next year many holidays fall in the middle or at the end of the week, therefore there will be fewer changes in the level of working days compared to this year.
The calendar will be reorganized for the first time around Labor Day to allow employees to stay at home for four days in a row.
Saturday, April 25th will be a working day to have a day off on Friday, May 2nd.
Another change is planned for October 23: Saturday, October 18 will be a working day replacing Friday, October 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year is under the sign of the holidays because from December 24, everyone will take a non-stop break even if the day of the new year falls on a Wednesday.
Six futile things that can bother colleagues terribly
Emails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that annoy us almost no more: these are things that “beautify” the daily life of a workplace.
The question is whether one gets used to these problems or meets the challenge and consciously avoids ambiguous situations, causing trouble to others.
Examples.
“Excuse me, I forgot to tell you that you were called from the marketing department,” a colleague told you.
That you missed a date?
At best he is sorry and tries to fix things by calling the marketing department to tell them that he forgot to pass on the message (this is the least common solution).
In most cases, this is arranged with an apology.
Before having painful explanations, it is helpful to think about how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
Are you borrowing something that doesn't belong to you?
There’s nothing more annoying than wanting to pick up a file, an office tool or the phone and you can’t find them anywhere.
Remember the day before you put the stapler on the desk but it disappeared the next morning?
Do you happen to find your pen that you thought was lost on your colleague's desk?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking or they're right to be angry at you for stealing their property.
Don’t bring any envelopes or post-its back in your pocket because it can be annoying that there aren’t any more and you need them right away.
Are you talking about co-workers' privacy?
There are no good ways to stop gossip from spreading.
Who did what, with whom?
Or and why?
Don’t tell everyone your information (assumptions) about your colleagues’ privacy!
If a colleague shares his or her intimate secrets with you, don’t misuse his or her trust!
Bury the information shared within yourself and do not discuss it with your colleagues in his absence even if your colleagues are also aware of it.
Are you professing to be ill for no good reason?
When you call the office and declare yourself sick under the pretext of a heartbreaking headache because you feel sick or feel you need rest that day, think about the fact that your work, your urgent affairs, your missions in the future must be carried out by someone else in your place.
Don't bother your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you will not go to work or that something may happen that would force you to stay at home, do not forget to inform your boss and your colleagues so that they will not be surprised by your absence the next day.
Chilling, grinning, phone
Are you immersed in your work but the laughing of your colleagues takes you out of it brutally?
Have you unwittingly become a witness to a phone conversation you'd better not listen to?
Don’t bother your colleagues with humming, chanting, chattering aloud (which you lead over their head), kicking, big words or discontent expressed aloud.
They can disturb even if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (writing, design, organization).
Are you accusing others of a mistake?
If your work is not done for the deadline, you forget to send a letter or an important message, do not accuse anyone for this forgetting!
Don’t put it on account of the eventual chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Recognize it if you made a mistake and if it presented inconvenience to others, repair the fault!
Ask how you can repair your fault, repair the negligence!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Wearing jogging and slippers is comfortable at home but they are not suitable for the office!
Do not wear comfortable jogging even if your function allows it!
Do not be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing properly, and if your function requires it by putting on pretty and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to meet expectations, you are no longer interesting
We move slowly into the usual morning stopper.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin with which electronic effects are associated.
I'll turn it up.
The music changes rhythm and the bass arrives to accompany the tones of all the time, then a female choir joins it as a real jewel.
Mr2 airs Zagar's song Wings of Love.
Hungarian music life has not spoiled us for a long time with good quality electronic pop.
Now it seems that the plug becomes different if you listen to Zagar’s new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born of the Hungarian digital underground are gradually beginning to change the overall image and, despite the new fashion of garage rock tearing the guitar, the Hungarian electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger arrived from Pécs and played himself in Yonderboi's group before he set out on his own path, perhaps because "there is no room for two feet in the same shoe".
His project (Zagar) and his music, an alloy of jazz, electronic dance music and pop, began to become known when he was entrusted with the composition of the soundtracks filmed (e.g.
The season of Ferenc Török).
The line-up initially playing in small clubs was beginning to be known by a wider audience when wan2 magazine cited their 2002 debut album among the 50 biggest records on the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, along with Yonderboi, the almost only creators of the Hungarian trend who would also be competitive in the west.
Zagar and his ensemble became undeniably trendy but no one asked them if they wanted to wear this label.
The band reacted right, they released a new and better record.
The album titled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, released recently, can open new paths for them, although the title wants to represent a continuity with the years spent in Pécs.
It was a line from the old group of Pécs by Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger.
We are fine with the reference to flight but next to the aerial music now appears, following the spirit and trend of the time, the guitar stronger, impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with the band The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs during the debut of the album at the Millennium Park.
On the album, there is a real tube for the radio, mr2 Pet<0xC3><0xB5>fi, recently broadcasting popular music from morning to evening, began to introduce the melodies of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
All is well (?).
hvg.hu asked Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger questions.
hvg.hu: This new tube pushes me to ask a question: did your music really remain music aimed at a certain layer?
Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs: The term music aimed at a certain layer does not tell me much.
For me there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial music and sincere music.
The so-called alternative, underground music can also be mediocre and made only to sell them and thus become commercial.
But a good pop song can be sincere, too.
The attitude of reception works in this spirit also independently of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between Hungarian and foreign audiences, is either one more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially in the west, light music has older traditions.
There, people go to concerts and not only the young people in their 10s or 20s but also the older ones.
They follow with much more attention the changes that have occurred in light music because they think that it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who, or how many people are listening to your music?
Zs.B.: I’m obviously glad to see that more and more people come to our concerts.
However, we have never made music for the market.
For us music is not made to achieve a goal but for a specific reason.
The role of the public is more important at concerts where mutual influence already works but it is perceived only in the elusive changes of the moment.
Now, I've noticed that if you want to meet the public's expectations, you won't be interesting anymore.
hvg.hu: Do you plan to follow Yonderboi's example?
He worked alone and had a career in the West.
Zs.B.: We don’t really follow his path even though sometimes some try to find traces in our music.
Rather, we are team players who trust each other’s musical presence and let it unfold.
At first, it was inevitable that our music would be compared to that of Yonderboi because many of us are leaving his band and taking a different path.
hvg.hu: On mr2 Pet<0xC3><0xB5>fi's list, Wings of Love takes the first place.
Many have heard Zagar's name for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style you have consciously opened up to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not plan to make a tube to be able to sell the record.
This song means more.
We wanted it for the end of the album to try to soften the orgy of sounds and more difficult themes addressed throughout the record.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why they - what was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel choir.
We had the idea to compose this choir of good soloists from the Hungarian music scene.
Thus was composed the six-member choir, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC3><0xB5> Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, which was later baptized Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like that or did the girls change it a little bit?
Zs.B.: This song already existed for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we wrote the album, we thought there was still something missing from this song.
The chord sequence attracted the voice of the song.
I sang that same night the melody the girls learned later.
I got it almost immediately and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember it galvanized me at the time but of course we needed the Divas.
With my voice she wouldn't have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the record and at the concert too it seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (with the exception of a short solo by Judy Jay), they do not have a single role, they all sing together and they do not sing louder than the music, so the music does not just accompany their singing.
They were behind the scene, too.
Was it wanted?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is due only to technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary was that we did not want to distribute solo roles.
The song also says that we have to forget our ego a little bit, forget who comes from where, who goes or, we just have to let those wings, the wings of love, take us away.
I wanted others to also feel that euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which of the songs made you work the most?
Zs.B.: Actually, none as to the process of creating music, we had more difficult pieces during the mixing.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then, little by little, it all came together like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I’ve already “released” this record.
Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth, and Never The Same.
The perfidious trader risked billions because of his inferiority complex
A covert fraudster.
This is how his former employee refers to the French giant Société Générale, owner of the Czech bank Komer<0xC4><0x8D>n<0xC3><0xAD> banka.
The bank lost nearly five billion euros because of him.
But it seems rather that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to match his colleagues, and who, moreover, can not be considered incapacitated.
Unlike all major banks, he recognized the U.S. mortgage market crisis in time.
"He's fragile," his superiors said, denouncing him to police.
However, if we stick to the testimony of Kerviel reported by the French media, including Le Monde, the transactions of this man produced at the end of last year a profit amounting to 1.6 billion euros.
The Crisis Exceeds the United States
“All I wanted was to make money for my bank,” he said in the statement.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the US crisis to earn half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Reports began to emerge in February that so-called "sub-prime" mortgages, granted to low-income clients or those who had encountered difficulties in repayment in the past, would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the entire economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and he bet well.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to 1.6 billion euros.
“As soon as I had won my first half-billion, I didn’t know how to announce it,” Kerviel said, adding that he didn’t, of course, keep anything to himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he confessed to falsifying the reports so as not to be tracked down.
He managed to fool his superiors, although the Eurex stock exchange began to take an interest in his transactions.
Who risks nothing has nothing
Was he afraid of being discovered?
I don't think so.
“I estimated that simply getting $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them.”
Where does your willingness to risk so much come from?
He only came to his post gradually.
He started working at Société Générale in 2000 just after finishing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already a trade assistant and, in 2005, he became an independent trader with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew he would never earn as much as the others.
“From my first interview in 2005, I knew I was much less regarded than the others.
In terms of my university course and my professional and personal path," Kerviel told investigators.
Shortly after taking office, he achieved his first major success.
Thanks to Allianz shares, he earned half a billion euros by betting on the decline of this title during the attacks in London.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As long as you win, we leave you alone
“It was like a snowball effect,” he told police.
But the superiors were aware of everything, or rather, they suspected it.
"As long as I won, they pretended to close their eyes."
This is where the start of the year comes in.
He loses a billion euros in a day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decides to hide the sum.
On Monday, when he arrives at work, he is no longer an employee of the bank.
A few days later, the bank announces that it has lost 5 billion euros because of him.
And how did we find out?
He became a suspect because of his vacation.
“Last year, I only took four days off.
A trader who doesn’t take a vacation is a trader who doesn’t want to leave his book to another,” Kerviel concludes.
The Czech Republic has the opportunity to obtain 365 billion
Yesterday, Czech government ministers signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, bring €14 billion (about CZK 365 billion) to the Czech Republic.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly 125 billion kroner from seven operational programmes will go to the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion crowns under the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit for the most part, up to 150 billion.
The Transport programme is the most important operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the financial resources that the Czech Republic can obtain under these projects.
This money will lead to an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage a sum of 90.8 billion crowns next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme, aimed at SMEs and entrepreneurs, should be used to obtain financial means to encourage innovation within the enterprise.
Companies should obtain financial means for the introduction of new technologies, research in industry, but also for the introduction of new, more efficient management methods.
Until now, the Czech Republic has been among the least successful beneficiaries of EU funds among the new members.
The Tribunal confirmed the sentence of 20 years in prison for the former president of Nicaragua
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal on Thursday upheld a 20-year prison sentence for former president Arnold Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for a fraud of $100 million (nearly 1.8 billion kroner).
However, he was later released and was under house arrest in his hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
Whether or not the former head of the Central American state, who was in office between 1997 and 2002, will be incarcerated again is not clear at the moment, according to the AP news agency.
According to the president of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on the prison officers, either they will let the German finish his sentence at home, or he will go back to prison.
Four years ago, the Tribunal proved that Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n regularly moved government money to foreign company accounts in Panama.
These were fictitious companies and the accounts were actually owned by his family members and his closest supporters.
Part of that money went into the funds that Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n had created to fund his election campaign in 2001.
The budget has been adopted
That's the way it is.
The state budget was adopted.
What makes this budget exceptional?
This is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the government majority without the support of the opposition.
The one for the current year passed a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, since it was Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could not afford to refuse it.
Contrary to the hectic debate before the vote of the declaration of distrust to the government, this time, nothing dramatic.
The House of Representatives passed this law without any problem, which, although the most influential, is usually neglected.
This is a kind of paradox.
Whether we like it or not, every chapter and every article is the beginning and the end of every government.
The budget was a constituent part of the policy, albeit hidden behind the competition of power between government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive in the media and that is why it is given more attention in the media.
The quarrels of politicians interest opinion far more than the abrupt figures.
The national budgets of past socialist governments suffered from three ills that the current budget is not able to deal with at the same time:
The first being the large share of mandate costs imposed by law, consisting not only of pensions, but also of social charges, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M parties.
The second is a deficit economy, a consequence of the first evil.
The third obstacle is the deficit of public finances, that is, the deficit of cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the deficit of the state budget that represents the greatest hazard.
It is public and relatively under control.
The real time bomb is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often issued stunned bonds, disproportionately indebted to their municipalities, in order to obtain, apart from money from taxes, tax duties and bank loans, new sources of investment.
In the past years, they were able to repay these debts through the mass sale of the shares of the distribution systems, especially those of energy, obtained from the State in the context of privatizations.
They no longer have that source.
Based solely on the official and verifiable facts, it can be seen that:
Our economy, like the rest of the world, has been going through a phase of growth for several years now, and <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is not out of the question.
This was a unique opportunity for the successive governments of this party to regularize public finances.
Instead, they were increasingly indebted to the state.
Other countries, with a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their affairs in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
This is a monstrous disgrace that essentially falls on previous governments.
We are among the countries that are the least endangered by poverty globally.
We do not therefore need massive social programmes which have, in recent years, unfortunately become unnecessarily swollen.
Although some of the absurd populist spending approved last year before the elections has been eliminated, if a shift in the retirement age limit and a reform of the pension system does not take place soon, then any policy will cease to exist in this country and whoever will be in power, he will only administer.
Hardly exaggerating, it can be said that the politicians in power will become bureaucrats mechanically distributing the majority of the imposed money between pensions and social benefits.
That is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that causes ordinary expenses to be pushed back by mandate fees.
The planned deficit of $70 billion for 2008 would be absolutely useless if previous governments had not dissipated as much money as they could.
If we really do not want the politicians in power to become mere bureaucrats, we need to be patient and give this fragile government coalition, aware that the state can only spend the equivalent of what it can collect in taxes and tax duties, the calm necessary for the preparation of new reform laws.
Only the latter will gradually achieve a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian central banks have decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
More than a hundred billion dollars will be placed on the money markets through auctions.
The banks will have to sell, through an auction system, the interest rates at which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will auction off $40 billion and provide $24 billion to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the Central Banks of individual States have decided to take such concerted action, aimed at preventing or reducing the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to solve the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group wrote in his report to clients.
“The concerted action of the central banks has reduced the probability of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to about 50 percent,” Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to unsecured loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect more losses in the billions.
"If the central banks have chosen this approach, it is because they really need to understand what can still follow," said ABN Chief Economist Amro Kieran Davies.
“It seems that the situation is really bad,” he adds.
The central banks fear that if the banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the U.S. economy into a recession that could affect economic growth around the world.
The Central Banks made this choice after they failed to bring down the London interbank rate, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still afraid of mutual borrowing, despite the fact that the U.S., Canadian and British central banks repeatedly lowered their interest rates during the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a further drop in interest rates," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts don’t believe that the central bank’s approach will help ward off the crisis, since it doesn’t solve the main problem that is the fall of the U.S. housing market.
President Klaus: The debates of the environmentalists are incredible
Global climate change is expected to affect developing countries in particular.
President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus has once again spoken out on the issue of global warming.
Criticism this time came at the United Nations international conference on climate change ending in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not Green, he stated that the debates among environmentalists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, made up of a curious mixture of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, that is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the accompanying rhetoric and reality.
“The debate is not structured at all, it’s just a rocket of words, solutions to current problems,” Klaus said.
The Czech President underlined, during the presentation of his book, that his subject matter is of great importance to him and that is why he is so committed to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book also appears in German translation, since, he said, "I often encounter only the caricature of my opinions".
From now on, interested persons can read his positions without being distorted.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climatologist, he nevertheless, in his opinion, has enough provisions to write such a book.
He is indeed an academician capable of following and appreciating scientific treatises, he has the practice of statistics and he is also an economist.
The main conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following thesis: the climate is constantly evolving, the changes in it are therefore normal, there is not a common opinion among all researchers on global warming, the effects of current changes are neither too great nor too serious, they therefore pose no danger and, finally, the efforts made to influence the evolution of the climate are inacceptably inacceptable.
Especially since he has the experience of a totalitarian regime, he considers it unacceptable to impose untrue opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous attack on freedom.
In response to questions from those present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable protection of the environment, but against fundamentalist environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the profit they bring."
In Vienna, Klaus had already spoken about it two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people failed to renew their driver’s license on time
Six hundred thousand drivers have allowed the deadline to expire and have not been able to renew their old driver's license whose validity expires at the end of the year.
We are the last day that people can still apply for renewal, so that the authorities are in a position to issue them a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Department is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of unlicensed drivers will be on the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their driving license especially those who no longer want to drive.
As municipalities report a drop in the number of licence renewal applications, authorities in the capital are inundated with applications and the number of licence renewal applications has been increasing this week.
The City Hall satisfies approximately 2000 customers per day.
There's a queue of about half an hour.
In Prague, nearly 140.OOO drivers have not yet renewed their driving licences.
The issuance of a new permit takes 20 days.
However, it is possible to request the issuance within a shortened period of five days.
In this case, the driver pays an additional five hundred crowns.
Vehicle drivers who fail to complete the mandatory renewal of the driver's license by the end of the year and will be on the road without a valid license, will face a fine as of January.
The culprit will be forced to pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer may also deal with the offence through an amicable approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine rises to 2500 crowns.
According to old information, even a person who was not going to circulate was liable to a fine.
In doing so, she could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry had called on the authorities to moderate and impose fines not exceeding 1000 kroner.
However, according to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka, no one risks fines in the tens of thousands.
In his view, a driver's license is a document that people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not as with the identity card that it must be valid without exceptions.
People who no longer want to drive should hand over their driver’s license.
Just bring it or send it to the corresponding municipality.
Driver's licenses issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, vehicle drivers are also forced to gradually renew other types of driving licences.
Persons with documents dating from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to complete the renewal.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Tribunal reduced the sentences of detectives contracted with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k, former police officers accused of collusion with David Berdych’s gang, will be jailed for 13 and 10 years, respectively.
The High Court of Prague thus sentenced them definitively by reducing their sentences by 1 year and 2 years respectively.
Initially, detectives in the Department for Combating Organized Crime risked 14 and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against the judgment handed down today, only an appeal to the High Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also charged in this case, he is currently awaiting the trial verdict.
However, he has already received sentences in other trials, the sum of which exceeds 16 years in prison.
He cannot receive more.
In January, the Departmental Court found 19 people guilty of participating in robberies, while the Superior Court today dealt with the interjections of appeals of 16 of them.
Most of the defendants had, since the beginning of the investigation, questioned the charge by claiming that it was a manipulated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Court of Justice, members of the police, after an agreement with Berdych among other things, transmitted information from police sources to criminals, covered the various robberies and helped gang members avoid criminal responsibility.
The gang paid 30 percent of the theft back to Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k.
The indictment refers to the gang's criminal activity from 1999 to 2001.
Essentially armed robberies, the victims of which have, in most cases, suffered serious damage to health, but also abuse of power by a public official and prohibited armaments.
During house searches, the police discovered illegally held pistols, shells with a steel core, a viewfinder for direct laser shooting or a machine gun.
According to the accusations, the gang has been enriched by tens of millions of crowns.
Aside from nearly twenty men from this trial, the courts have already convicted other Berdych robberies and a whole host of others.
Other men from Berdych's neighborhood are still explaining themselves to the court in another trial, some cases have not yet reached the court.
The main hearing has so far avoided Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>ta and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej who are currently in detention in Ireland, where they are awaiting a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The price of child substitution: 12 million
The lawyer of the families involved in the disaster, Igor Veleba, wants to obtain from the T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> hospital a compensation of 12 million crowns plus the costs.
Three million for each of the mothers, two million for the fathers and one million for each of the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That is why the lawyer of the Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l hospital absolutely disagrees with Veleba's proposal.
"We reject such a claim, this one is very, very high," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l said after the hearing.
"To be able to make an opinion on the counterproposal, we need the expert report that the opposing party commissioned the drafting.
We will check if it has any explanatory value.
But we continue to think that the total amount should not exceed hundreds of thousands," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l said.
According to him, the amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 K<0xC4><0x8D> for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov's family demanded a million crowns for each month when she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, prepared for him by the University Hospital Centre in Prague-Motol, as a document in support of the compensation negotiations.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, parents suffered psychological damage and were prone to stress at different scales and depths.
The stressful situation was better supported by men, although they faced remorse for not being able to prevent the substitution of newborns.
Women, however, remain less serene in the face of the experience of trauma in the news and in the face of what is happening precisely at this time, summarized the contents of the Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> hospital on December 9.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola at the <0xC4><0x8C>erm<0xC3><0xA1>k in P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavice and Veronika at Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanov<0xC3><0xA1> in Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov.
At the end of October, the governor of the Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vystr<0xC4><0x8D>il region handed over 100,000 crowns to each of the families for the reimbursement of the expenses caused by the error of the T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> hospital managed by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are required by law to have liability insurance.
In case of non-compliance, they must draw from the reserve fund, exceptionally, they can ask for help from the manager.
Until now, the courts had recognized relatively small amounts of compensation, the sums calculated according to the tables were in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lovstv<0xC3><0xAD> (the Kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko)
Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost the litigation over the brand Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské kr<0xC3><0xA1>lovstv<0xC3><0xAD> (Kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko).
According to the judge of the regional court of Ostrava, it was indeed he who used for the first time the title King of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko, but the project was set up by the team around Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, former collaborator of the actor.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka was not present at today's hearing.
However, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team are parasitizing on the popularity of Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka," Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, the words Kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko evoke everyone precisely this actor and comedian.
Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> is of the same opinion.
“There’s a job behind us that’s been going on for almost 10 years.
Searching for money and developing events," he said.
According to him, money is the cause of the dispute.
“After years, they realized that the project is successful and that they could benefit from it.
They are the ones who want to parasitize on our work,” he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, it was Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka who first used the title vala<0xC5><0xA1>sk<0xC3><0xBD> kr<0xC3><0xA1>l (King of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko) in his television show.
Actor Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD> crowned him king in 1993.
At the time, this had nothing to do with the plan to establish a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of issuing passports of the Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lovstv<0xC3><0xAD>.
From a humorous action originally emerged a business and a lucrative commercial activity, followed by the creation, by Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, of the company Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské kr<0xC3><0xA1>lovstv<0xC3><0xAD>.
In 1997, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka agreed to have his name and signature quoted in the passport and even offered the holders sales on the price of the visit to his farm and his theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> only used the bare idea, published by Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka in the show mané<0xC5><0xBE>, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka certainly helped the Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské kr<0xC3><0xA1>lovstv<0xC3><0xAD> project," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team who devoted themselves to the project intensely.
The collaboration between the now-enemy parties continued until 2000 when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized for Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka an official coronation in Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, which culminated in the deposition of "King Boleslav 1st Elected Forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, assumed by the singer Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>ul<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka filed a complaint against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his company, which the court has now rejected.
What could make the case clear is the tournament envisaged for the throne and half of the princess.
A new king should come out of it.
He did not yet want to betray the details and the date.
“We don’t want to go to work quickly.
It would be something like the parade of kings in Slov<0xC3><0xA1>cko.
The king would be elected for a time.
Even Mr. Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka can of course register," Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> added.
Test of the Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearance of prejudices
I’ve never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its rolling qualities were nothing extraordinary, the quality of the gearshift, of the driving and also of the manufacturing could, in many ways, be qualified as below average.
Currently, there is a successor on the market, the Peugeot 207, which is much better.
Especially since the combi named SW goes a step further, I just have to think better.
When I was testing the classic hatchback of the Peugeot 207 I was complaining about, for example, head space on the rear seats.
While there ended the complaints because the combi bodywork means that even the great devils will be, in this regard, comfortable.
Let's see quickly done
I'm going to talk about the interior very quickly so as not to repeat myself too much.
This is a pretty successful design, my only remark about the central tunnel that seems to me to be poor.
There, I would have liked a slightly more inventive design, given that the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the days when you could complain about seats or backrests that were too short are over.
The lateral guidance has also improved significantly compared to the model 206.
As for the space, the increase in the dimensions of the bodywork is noticeable here too.
The combi also sees the lack of space above the head already mentioned disappear.
A safe in the safe
The most important thing about this vehicle is its luggage compartment.
I have to evaluate it as very accessible (also thanks to the rear swivel ice) and a rather easy stowage.
Blind spaces are equipped with stop elastics which constitute an ideal compromise.
It is not bulky and can be extended while being able to hold fairly heavy objects.
But let's stop at the volume.
This makes, according to the tables, 428 l in the basic configuration, which is a rather average figure compared to the competition.
Apart from the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi, the best-selling vehicle in this category in the Czech Republic.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mlada Boleslav, we see that the Peugeot is very significantly behind, the difference being 52 liters.
When it comes to going on vacation abroad or loading a stroller, this figure is almost critical.
But, if I had to highlight the advantages, I would mention the underbody remaining after the reverse of the backrests of the rear seats perfectly straight, or a very low step.
120 horsepower on four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And actually, that’s what a 1.6 should look like that’s what makes a family hatchback work.
It is silent, consumes little and, above all, grows well.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by <0xC5><0xA0>koda which often gives the impression of having an exhaust jar clogged by a sprocket, then I can only be enthusiastic about it.
Let's go through the rates
The price of the vehicle is not affordable by everyone.
However, we must be aware that we tested a fairly well-equipped car, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with a 1.4 litre Otto engine of 329 900 K<0xC4><0x8D> is still reasonable.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410 900 K<0xC4><0x8D>, which is already enough.
The Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price by 80,000 K<0xC4><0x8D>.
In addition to head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic windscreen wipers, automatic rear window control...
In reality, the vehicle costs in the end 531 900 K<0xC4><0x8D>.
That's a lot, but try to add extra equipment to the price of the Fabia and you'll get a very similar figure.
All that remains is to choose the brand.
Integration of Slovak pupils in UK schools is bad
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, causing concern among the departing population about the evolution of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a series of obstacles.
British schools are even witnessing cases where conflicts between immigrants and the descendants of the original inhabitants turn into violence.
The case of North Kent, where conflict between immigrants and immigrants of Slovak origin is beginning to escalate, illustrates the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
Disputes, chicanes and fights between students have transposed into relationships between parents.
The situation went so far that police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who was beating a ten-year-old student with an iron bar.
The culprit defends herself by claiming that the boy had insulted him with racist remarks.
Police also had to intervene following the attack on a Slovak immigrant carried out by two teenagers.
The girls allegedly made racist remarks to the man and threw stones at him.
“When we got home, a young man climbed up the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he responded with apples and pears and then he discovered his buttocks," another nasty adventure was described by a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the residents went so far as to qualify conflicts with immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above show that the atmosphere in British schools between natives and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
Seventy thousand Slovaks who came to find work are registered in Britain.
And about 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it really is an island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can happen if you make a good choice.
Golden and white beaches like snow, high waves or a calm sea like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with waiters offering you on the beach a pizza, ice cream or intoxicating cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will not find this list only in its entirety, but enriched.
However, there is only one island on which you will find much more and that is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Greater Antilles.
At the time of the Spaniards, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christopher Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the deposit and the place of transfer of the treasures that the Spanish had stolen and that they transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built in the early 1920s.
It was Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American mafia, who built it, since everything that was a crime in the USA (especially under prohibition) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his clients were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise buildings sprang up and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the 1950s of the last century, circulated on the wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and, in Coj<0xC3><0xAD>mar, he owned his yacht.
Show business stars and politicians from all over America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita in Havana.
In the bar of the Hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, we will mix the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars still circulate in Havana, since the jigoulis and fiats once imported have already long ago, in such a salty and humid climate, rotten.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is significantly decrepit, nowhere else in the vicinity are as many splendid colonial monuments as there are precisely there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Since tourism brings money if necessary, its development has the green light.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varader, on the coast of the Holgu<0xC3><0xAD>n province, and also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique in the world and that will be appreciated especially by lovers of small trains.
The cane had re-entered from the plantations extended into the sweet shops on a narrow track by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades and this is how we can see small locomotives running, whose contemporaries are not only in museums elsewhere.
Where to direct his steps?
The majority of visitors do not miss the most well-known places.
There is no need to write much about Varadero or Havana.
Otherwise remember that in the Hemingway property, already mentioned, there is a museum and whoever loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The Vi<0xC5><0x88>ales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
Exuberant vegetation grows there on limestone soil.
Mogotes, limestone balloons and rocks rise from the bottom of the valley, and, as fertile soil has become trapped in their bowels, even its rotten rocks are covered with a very dense vegetal carpet.
The valley is probably the place where Cuban tobacco of the best quality is grown.
You will be able to meet the final shape of this product if you visit one of the cigar factories in Havana.
Perhaps someone will also find it interesting that this is where the Chilean episode of Major Zeman was shot.
Trinidad
An ancient town founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
It was the slave trade and the sugar trade that brought him glory and wealth.
Wealth has been embodied in the beauty and character of this small city.
Koloni<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC3><0xAD> <0xC5><0xA1>pan<0xC4><0x9B>lsk<0xC3><0xA1> architektura,v<0xC3><0xBD>razn<0xC4><0x9B> ovlivn<0xC4><0x9B>n<0xC3><0xA1> pozd<0xC4><0x9B>j<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD>mi francouzsk<0xC3><0xBD>mi osadn<0xC3><0xAD>ky, if <0xC4><0x8D>ty<0xC5><0x99>i stalet<0xC3><0xAD> tem<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99> nezm<0xC4><0x9B>nila.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountain massif, is a place so remote that even in the 50's of the last century, there was no road that would connect this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay on his side.
We didn't build anything, and that's why we didn't demolish anything either, everyone just had a roof over their heads.
If you have more time in Trinidad than an afternoon, then it is also worth going to see interesting places in the surroundings, such as Playa Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n beach or the Sugar Valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la M<0xC3><0xBA>sica which comes to life after sunset and where the music does not go out until the early morning.
Baracoa
Some refer to this village located in the extreme east of Cuba as the most beautiful on the island.
This opinion is certainly already influenced by the path that leads to it.
The two roads leading from Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo must cross high and rugged mountains and cross a landscape almost without marks of human activity.
UNESCO has inscribed the eastern reef of Cuba, thanks to its intact landscape, on the World Heritage List.
The best chocolate is made in the church, there is the Christopher Columbus Cross (in reality, it was born about a hundred years after Columbus' journey) and from the hill where the old castle and the current El Castillo hotel are located, you can see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountain range, the Bay of Sows and Isla de Pinos Island, the Tropicana Cabaret, the sanctuary of the patron saint of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, the African religions practiced by the descendants of the ancient slaves, about all this we could fill a lot.
Only, as they say, it is better to see once.
In Afghanistan, Allies Are Passive, Say Americans
The lack of soldiers and necessary equipment influences, according to the United States, the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defence Minister Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not proceeding as it should, representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country have agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing protests from the Taliban movement, the eight states involved are also discussing future plans and allied coordination.
While the United States this week called on NATO troops through Defence Minister Robert Gates for greater activity, Britain sees as a priority the strengthening of the authority of the Afghan government and the intensification of development aid.
“The evolution in Afghanistan is perceptible, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow residents to start a new development of the economy and security themselves," British Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents is, according to US military data, the most intense in the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 percent from last year, to 60 percent in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, nearly a quarter of them in the southern part.
However, according to the United States, the allies reached their absolute limit and in the organization and equipment of the troops.
Concretely, they are asking for other helicopters, soldiers and experts for the training of Afghan troops.
“We will need to think seriously about the concrete goals for the coming period, as well as how to achieve them,” Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop made similar remarks today.
“I’m not happy with what we have on land and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that’s not enough,” De Hoop told Reuters at the end of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo that lasted three days.
Who is Passive
In recent months, there have also been conflicts between the countries involved over whether all allies are actually doing their best in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the combat demands they are subject to are not as stringent as those in the southern and eastern parts of the country where we operate,” Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun called German soldiers lazy this week.
"The lazy Afghans discovered: the Germans are playing, while ours are fighting," Sun wrote in a document supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild went on the counter-attack by publishing a photo of a British troupe during a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debt to rise to 1 trillion in 2009
The burden of a state debt exceeding 84,000 kronor lies with each Czech.
The total debt rose at the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
The government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
As a result of better-than-expected changes in state budget savings, the ministry reduced the projected amount to 152.8 billion kroner.
The debt of the State of the Czech Republic rose towards the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
During the nine months of this year it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, as of June, it decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
Today, the Ministry of Finance confirmed its data on the state debt dating from early October.
The burden of a debt exceeding 84,000 kronor lies with each Czech.
Over the past year, the state has indebted itself more than 111 billion kroner.
“For now, it seems that, thanks to a smaller deficit forecast for next year, we could cross the border by a trillion crowns only in 2009.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between $900 billion and $1 trillion," Patria Finance analyst David Marek told iHNed.cz.
Next Finance analyst Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Pikor’s forecast is similar: “We could exceed the trillion in the course of 2009.
The precise date will depend on the next budget that is not yet known.
If it appeared that the situation on the political scene was changing, that politicians were prepared to save more, the date could be postponed to 2010.
But I’m not expecting this change,” he said.
Debts are Growing
The debt of the state is constituted by the debts of the central government and is generated mainly by the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
State debt is financed by treasury bills, annuity bills, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The domestic debt of the state has so far increased this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The state's external debt has so far increased this year from 1.7 billion kroner to 123.3 billion kroner.
The state debt called negotiable reached at the end of September 803.3 billion crowns and as of June it decreased by 13.7 billion crowns.
The average debt of the state amounted to 6.5 years.
“Total debt increased year-on-year from the first to the third half of the year by 13 percent, which is, given the current good health of the economy, a far too high figure.
It is interesting that the increase is generated mainly by annuity securities where it reaches 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be matter to negotiate when the pension reform comes,” commented the Pikora data.
Better than we expected
It follows the government's debt financing and management strategy for 2007 that the government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
However, at the beginning of September, thanks to better-than-expected changes in state budget savings, the ministry reduced the projected amount to 152.8 billion crowns.
The sum is mainly constituted by the deficit of the state budget which will clearly reach 76 billion kroner this year, instead of the 91.3 billion kroner originally planned.
Then there are the maximum sources for the Czech Consolidation Agency, namely 13.3 billion kroner, the reserve of 10 billion for pension payments, the financing of government bonds for 43 billion kroner and repayments of loans from the European Investment Bank amounting to 1.8 billion kroner.
She was in court in Khartoum today for naming a teddy bear.
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced Thursday evening by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and deportation, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of having allowed 6- to 7-year-old students to name a teddy bear Mohammed while any depiction of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was punished with a whiplash.
The 54-year-old British teacher, who works at the Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested Sunday at her home and charged under article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code with Islam and sedition, following several complaints by parents of pupils to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to September, when this teacher asked her students, aged 6/7, to choose a name for the teddy bear in the class.
“Eight names come out of the mouths of children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” says school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their preferred first name.
Muhammad is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
The children then made a book for the class with the photo of the bear followed by the caption “My name is Mohamed”.
The bear itself did not carry any labels with that name, but the problem is simply that of the depiction of the prophet as an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons’ Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that might be insulting to a religious faith, “I just regret that she asked children to vote for a name,” he said it was only an “innocent mistake.”
Opinion shared by many of the teacher’s students who describe her as “very attentive to her students” and “never talking about religion in class.”
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Britain, it is written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can you give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
They did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province at the last negotiating session in Vienna on Wednesday.
In the end, failure.
The Serbs and Kosovo Albanians concluded a sixth and final session of talks in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning without being able to overcome their differences over the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties were unable to reach an agreement on the status," European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger told a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was “at stake,” his US counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of negotiations.
“We do not foresee violence immediately, but we are entering a very difficult period,” he added, noting that “obvious tensions exist.”
End of Mediation on December 10
The mediators of the troika, which includes the European Union, the United States and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the 90% Albanian-speaking province could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko deliver their report to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final session of negotiations since the troika was tasked with a new mediation by the United Nations in August.
Americans and Europeans believe that their mediation will end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the Security Council from granting independence to Kosovo, insist that negotiations continue beyond this deadline.
“Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution,” Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After eight years of UN administration of Kosovo, Westerners believe that EU-supervised independence is the only viable solution.
Pristina said it was ready to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council did not decide in its favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached," Kosovo Autonomous Authority President Fatmir Sejdiu said in the Baden hotel where the "last-chance negotiations" had been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, expressed his regrets.
But he added that the autonomy plan put forward by Belgrade “belonged to a past that led to murders and deportations.”
‘Domino effect’
Serbian President Boris Tadic said a compromise was still conceivable, warning Kosovo's Albanian majority against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
Belgrade said it feared a “domino effect” in a region still weakened by the independence wars of the 1990s.
“For Serbia,” he said, “it does not mean that a compromise is impossible.”
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision be made exclusively by the Security Council, where its Russian ally has a veto.
"The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word"
“Only one solution in the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia,” Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
“These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council.”
Fatmir Sedjiu told reporters that "the Kosovo Parliament will have the final say on the status", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by Albanians would be made "in consultation" with Westerners.
Bush cuts deal between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced at the opening of the international peace conference convened by him on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately start negotiations to find a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a “peace treaty” before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must dismantle “terrorist infrastructure” and Israel must end its settlement activities, Bush said, reminding both sides of their obligations under the “road map” for peace they agreed to in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority under Abbas would aim “to conclude a peace treaty resolving all outstanding issues, without exception, including core issues.”
This name covers the three thorny issues at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees driven from their homes in what is now the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the US president, Abbas insisted that future negotiations be "global and thorough" and cover all aspects of a settlement, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, settlements, water, security, among others."
In turn, Olmert pledged that the upcoming talks would be "direct and continuous" and "an effort to complete them in the course of 2008".
At the end of 2008, Bush set the deadline for implementing his co-existing Palestinian and Israeli “two-state vision.”
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had obtained a commitment in this sense from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is behind a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which proposes peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it addresses the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," Prince Saud said in an interview with the Saudi Arabian daily.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As every time in this type of various fact, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the Inspectorate General of the National Police (IGPN), a police car was circulating Sunday, shortly after 5 pm, rue Louise-Michel, in Villiers-le-Bel.
“She was not in intervention but on patrol, and was travelling at 40-50 km/h, without a gyroscope,” a police source said.
A Kawazaki-branded green motorcycle, “not approved, therefore not allowed to drive on the public road” (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, was circulating “at a very fast pace”.
“She hit the police car on her left, after a refusal of priority on the right,” a police officer said.
The blood alcohol test performed on the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The condition of the car (before crashed, star windshield, bumper ripped) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thér<0xC3><0xA8>re de Givry, announced that she had entrusted an investigation for "facts of involuntary homicide and non-assistance to persons in danger" to the IGPN, co-ordinated with the departmental direction of public security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor stated that the investigation of the IGPN, at this stage, excluded the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, heard Sunday evening, confirmed "the version of the police, namely that this mini-moto arrived relatively quickly on their left".
Yesterday, a kind of groove, no doubt caused by the friction of the wedges on the ground, showed that the two vehicles remained entangled until the police car managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police quickly left the place, thus not lending aid to the two young people.
The IGPN, while remaining cautious, would also rule out "any serious misconduct" on this point.
“This is a more difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigations, on which we must be very careful,” a police source said.
Libération met an eyewitness from those few moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows facing the scene.
“We immediately went down, with my cousin who is a nurse at the hospital, to try to revive them,” the witness said.
There was nothing to do.”
He then saw “a completely haggard policeman, who was limping.
Two others were trying to revive one of the young people, the fourth was talking on the phone.”
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, with the certainty that the people present had of the unexpected situation of the young people, the police officers were taken by car by colleagues who had arrived at the scene.
According to the witness, rescue workers arrived “about twenty minutes after the police left.”
They also practiced heart massages, in vain.
“I will not let it be said that the police services did not provide assistance to young people.
These young people have been rescued.
The firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything has been done to try to save them,” the prosecutor said.
Tensions Rise in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday cracked down on the first protests since the establishment of a state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the eastern city of Lahore, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against the state of emergency were injured by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement, witnesses said.
They fought back with stone throws, injuring police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were arrested.
Similar scenarios in Karachi and Rawalpindi, or police officers charged and injured lawyers.
Many would have been arrested.
In Islamabad, lawyers at the Supreme Court bar called for a general strike and announced protests following a wave of some 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets leading to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the rally.
Other demonstrations were reported to have taken place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers' movement on Monday garnered support from religious parties in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal whose president "urged the population to send flowers to judges who spoke out against the state of emergency and debris to those who swore in front of Musharraf."
"Musharraf's promise no longer holds."
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly targeted by the emergency measure proclaimed Saturday night.
In the coming days, it was expected to rule on the legality of President Musharraf’s re-election to the presidency on 6 October, by indirect suffrage.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was ousted and replaced.
“Everything we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to Supreme Court rulings,” the magistrate told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army and become a civilian president "doesn't stand anymore" after the state of emergency was instituted, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to give up his military uniform by November 15, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government has denied insistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf has been placed under house arrest by his deputy army chief.
More than a third of pregnancies remain unplanned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as ill-planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, more than one in three (36%) pregnancies are not expected, reveals a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote on the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as ill-planned or unforeseen births.
The different methods of contraception such as the pill or the sterile still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, estimates Ined.
However, the liberalization of contraception has allowed for better “fertility control”, according to the institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
Even calculated in the month for one in five couples and if possible in the spring, the season considered as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It took astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates from the International Space Station (ISS) more than seven hours of space work to make the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel essential to the station’s continued scientific activities.
A risky exit that has accumulated records due to its duration, its distance from the habitable modules, the speed with which it was imagined, the tools "manufactured" by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday as astronauts unloaded the Discovery module Harmony, a large cylindrical piece charged with soon hosting European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a kind of docking station for laboratory modules.
But we need to be able to supply them with electricity.
The crew's second task was to move a 17.5-ton solar panel power generation module, already on the ISS, to its final position.
After moving it, the crew began redeploying the module's solar panels, which have a span of 76 meters.
And this is where one of the panels, unfolding like accordions, was damaged for nearly a meter by a cable that got stuck.
The deployment was stopped to avoid further damage to the panel.
The astronauts, who were originally supposed to make a control exit from the Discovery shuttle, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go snailing at the end of the 30 meters of length of the remote-controlled arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to carry out the repair.
He is one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very skillful, it has very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, the training doctor was tasked with “operating” the “wounded” solar panel.
After accurately inspecting the damage, he severed the faulty cable and installed some sort of "spindles" on the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second spacewalker who remained near the wreckage and, from the inside, by other astronauts including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey cane wrapped in insulation to prevent electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and "diggled" by the astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation was complete, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before taking inventory of his tools and returning to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half-day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts return to the Discovery shuttle for a return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned on the stock exchange
EADS stock is in a sharp decline on the Paris stock exchange, after the aeronautics and defence group announced it would have to spend between €1.2 billion and €1.4 billion to cope with A400M delays.
EADS loses 4% to 21.96 euros currently on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been forced to revise its 2007 operating result forecast due to delays caused by the slow progress in the development of the A400M engine, which conditions the aircraft's maiden flight.
The cost to compensate for the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft, announced in October, is "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros of which more than 1 billion for Airbus", announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
Due to these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new operating income targets (EBITs) for 2007 at the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, he adds without further quantified details.
The group also indicates that the estimation of new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
As a reminder, the operating income of EADS fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to expenses related to the delays of another program, that of the very large A380 carrier.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
There will be no suspense, Sunday, at the exit of the polls: the Russians will massively opt for the party of President Putin, united Russia.
Confirming their aspiration for stability, or even authoritarianism, after a very locked-in campaign.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends voters a televised message on public channels, already recorded but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as head of the list of United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is expected to be overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president did not reveal anything about it by welcoming foreign ambassadors, just delivering a new charge against the West accused of interference - his favorite theme during the campaign.
“We know the price of true democracy and we want honest, transparent and open elections, elections without problems,” he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from counting.
She denounces a campaign tainted with pressure.
Communist leader Gennadi Zyouganov says there has never been "such a dirty election, even in the days of Yeltsin."
After the crackdown on protests last weekend, former chess world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal protest, remains banned from visiting, according to his lawyer.
“The Russians have kept the homo sovieticus mentality.”
Behind these unsuspecting legislatures are two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin as president?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot seek a third consecutive term.
But no successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Leader of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party who would choose the government and the president?
Either way, in the legislative or presidential elections, outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
“The Russians have kept the homo sovieticus mentality, they do not feel master of their destiny,” says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov, from St. Petersburg State University, goes further: civil society has lagged behind in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, “Putin returned to the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population, especially since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic ease,” says Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians “voluntarily renounce the personal responsibility” they had briefly demonstrated after the breakup of the USSR.
“What good is it to think?”
The phenomenon affects all social strata, including the business world.
And the administrative elite wants to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of United Russia.
New liberties imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
People prefer stability.
In the name of which the Russians will not vote for extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Cherednitchenko, 54-year-old teacher: “What is the point of thinking?
Those in power aren’t too bad, why change them?”
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of secrecy, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which trace the destinies of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are openly accessible.
The 47 million archival documents, stored on 27 km of line in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were so far only available for "humanitarian" purposes, that is, individually and nominatively, at the request of a former victim or his heirs.
The eleven states in charge of their management - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
The process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed and the opening has been in effect since yesterday.
Sensitive Information
Historians' access to Bad Arolsen will allow research "including on prisoners' movements, camp population and the state of health of forced labour," said Reto Meistern, director of the archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, were opposed to the opening to the public of these nominative documents, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
Such as the supposed homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo had been collected after the war for a practical purpose: to find civilians deported or subjected to compulsory work and, if necessary, to provide proof of their internment, in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees process tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for some of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
“There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents,” said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for Research on Antisemitism at the Technische Universität Berlin in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, Indo-European bilateral trade is already worth almost €60 billion per year.
The EU is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
In April, EU foreign ministers gave the European Commission the green light to start negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its largest foreign investor, but India is only the EU’s 9th trading partner, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A free trade pact will greatly benefit both economies" and "India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," Mandelson said.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the top ten products exported by India, said the European Commissioner Manuel. The Asian and European giants trade each year for "47 billion euros of goods" and for "ten billion euros of diplomatic services", said this week Dani<0xC3><0xA8>le Smadja, head of the delegation of the European Commission in New Delhi, regretting that the trade still reached the EU's "Sinth"

Bank of England takes note of concerns by offering <0xC2><0xA3>10bn over five weeks
The Bank of England said Thursday it was anxious to ease the current return of concerns over credit conditions, and announced an offer of <0xC2><0xA3>10bn at the base rate of 5.75 percent over five weeks, an unusually long offer.
"To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organize their liquidity positions over that period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its expected reserve input during the maintenance period commencing on December 6 as a five-week open-market operation," the bank said in a statement.
The bank says that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on December 6 at 12:15 GMT, at the base rate and until January 10.
This is the first time it appears that the BoE is putting five-week cash on the market in an open market operation.
These are normally done at one week.
The BoE added in its statement that it "stands ready to take further steps to maintain the rates" of day-to-day interbank loans in line with its base rate.
The day-to-day interbank rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month rate stood at 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the start of the summer financial crisis, the sums put on the market by the Bank of England had been accompanied by a large penalty rate that had discouraged banks from resorting to them.
According to some rumors, corroborated by the change in the price of the pound against the euro, many preferred to subscribe to the sums put on the market by the European Central Bank, at more advantageous rates and with a more assured discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to consider PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre groups on Thursday refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist "niche" (meeting at the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted Tuesday by the national bureau of the PS including the increase of 50% of the employment premium, the restoration of the floating TIPP, a transport check or the supervision of rents.
UMP and NC having voted against the review of the articles (180 votes to 115), the session was adjourned at the end of the general discussion that gave rise to exchanges, sometimes lively, between majority and opposition a few hours from Nicolas Sarkozy's television intervention on purchasing power.
PS MP leader Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent all of his proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending finance bill considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival is born
Following many rumors about C3 Presents' creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with Melvin Benn's Festival Republic.
“For our company, it’s an honor to work with someone who has, no more and no less, inspired the current festival movement in America,” C3’s Charlie Jones told Billboard.com.
C3 produced the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival is expected to be held August 8-10 on a private 500-acre farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Festival Republic director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury the “most inspiring event” he’s ever attended, C3’s Charlie Jones says his company and Melvin Benn’s are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
“We had chosen Philadelphia as our marketplace and were working diligently with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
“We were in talks with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we got bogged down in politics because of the current administration, continues Charlie Jones.
“Fortunately, we were able to chat with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a beautiful festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Chicago’s Grant Park, after standing out in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
Both festivals are held in urban areas.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a country festival, while ours takes place in urban green spaces,” says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both the impression of a European-style country festival and an American-style urban one.”
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the holding of this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but says "that they are interesting enough to allow us to invest in such an event and to host a festival that will hopefully have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the festival’s capacity is “very large,” like that of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said that invitations were issued to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed at the time of going to press.
“Vineland will be rock-flavored, but the music will be varied, in the hopes of attracting all kinds of spectators,” says Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter award from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal takes on the Terminator
It’s not easy to lure Hollywood movie sets to Montreal when none other than Terminator opposes it...
This mission of seduction is part of the functions of delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to play in the paws of the "Governor"?
“You have to be careful, it’s the industry that decides where it’s going.
If she thinks the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go.
Our role is to offer the ones they will judge the best,” he says.
The Race to Festivals
For the moment, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is the promotion of cinema here.
The race for the Oscars has begun.
It will be of all the West Coast festivals, be it Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, a matter of presenting Quebec films, highlighting them and ensuring that directors do interviews.
The Dark Ages had a great showcase at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on stage in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be an end-of-year rally on the stock market? Experts divided by the sub-prime crisis.
Less than five weeks before the end of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands in hopes of the arrival of the traditional year-end rally.
However, this year the experts are not so sure that this will happen.
Banif believes that "statistically, December on the stock market generally behaves positively.
However, it is not appropriate to make forecasts based exclusively on statistics, since given the current context, uncertainties await markets, at least in the short term.
Although they are not in favour of the stock market gaining momentum during the last weeks of the year, these experts note that "the stock market feeds on the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of flight to quality values both in long periods and in short periods".
For this, they believe that the stock market will behave rather sideways, not free of volatility "especially because we do not know the impact of the probable fall in the Fed's rates, given the high level of crude and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions"
Javier Barrio, BPI’s head of sales in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say there will be a rally.
“It’s not the best thing,” the expert says.
The Spanish stock index, Ibex, has lost nearly 4% since November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points thanks to the reorganization of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert nuances that things will be a little different this year since he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of the feast of the Constitution (December 6).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, analyst at Inversis Banco, assesses that we are close to the technical levels and "that is why we could observe a rebound in the index that could be provoked depending on the information coming from the European Union regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst hopes that these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for driving the Ibex to new maximum odds.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that "this year the great values are back for him".
The expert would include in the portfolio the two major banks and a few manufacturers "because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banco assures that the increases will be due to the bank and the industrial sector.
The builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, in case they start.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other manufacturers such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path," the expert explains.
Cyclical consumption will play a leading role in the latter part of the year due to increased sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies will also do very well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
For the past seven years, December has been a bearish month on only two occasions.
The authentic year-end rally took place in 2003, a year in which the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the penetration of the technology bubble.
This year, during which the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, the month of December recorded an increase of 6.68%.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of gains (so far Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and if it succeeds in computer on its year-end rally.
The Banque Populaire will open 200 offices open 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
The Banque Populaire has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 banks are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish organizations, since it is the first group that has decided to start betting on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 8:30 pm, and to open on Saturday from 10 am to 8:30 pm.
Another group that has also reiterated several times that it would like to amplify the schedules of its branches, BBVA, even if it has not yet decided to take the first step.
He is on the verge of reaching an agreement with the unions to close 75% of its agencies on Saturday instead of opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the experience of the Banque Populaire will be decisive for whether or not other organizations adhere to this initiative that coincides with business hours.
This is precisely what the People's Bank is looking for.
Attracting autonomous customers who circulate in these areas to make their purchases in SMEs and shops of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 branches throughout Spain in about 18 months, since it is not the opening of new branches but a renovation of existing ones.
For this, the organization will modernize the branches it already has in the commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of the customers of the different streets.
In this way, the amplification of the schedules is accompanied by a different design of the interior of the branch and a new design, more current, with brighter colors.
Bank sales manager <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera says the renovation does not involve large investments, but the hiring of staff, as the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
The agencies, which will also have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Banque Populaire has already tested its initiative in three agencies in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, as <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero explains.
The branches of Madrid’s Murillo Brave, O’Donnell and Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a streets are the streets to have been chosen, and apparently successfully, according to Rivero.
Banque Populaire currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others who operate under the brand of Mundocredit, specialized in the case of immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which open even on Sundays and public holidays.
In these PopularMax agencies they will not copy the model of the BBVA, where several of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our customers,” Rivero said.
For the time being, they have reached an agreement with Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco doubles the stock market value of rival Antena 3 for the first time
We got there.
With this phrase Paolo Vasile, a Telecinco CEO, yesterday expressed his satisfaction, at the closing of the stock market, when he found that the channel he runs doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
One aspect tarnished his joy: "What hurts me is not the fact that we have increased more, but that we have decreased less," he said.
However, he emphasized that in a weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with a 2.54% increase.
This gain has stabilized its loss at 15.66% for the past year.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento ( 13% more) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to data from Bloomberg.
Its rival Antena 3, which sold 1.52% yesterday and has accumulated a 40.5% drop since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other publicly traded communications companies amounted to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million in that of Prisa (the publisher of Cinco D<0xC3><0xAD>as) and 1,779 million in that of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenne 3 is due to the fact that ' we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are capable of doing, in the same market, at what price, and how we make it profitable in terms of audience.”
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become this year the first television channel to exceed 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, as assured Giuseppe Tringali, the managing director of Telecinco and Publiespa<0xC3><0xB1>a, the subsidiary that manages the group's advertising.
In order for this data to be true, the television channel should record for the current fiscal year a 3.6% increase in its billing for advertising compared to $965.4 million for the 2006 fiscal year.
Antenna 3's net revenue increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the fiscal year (to $734.4 million) while net television revenue increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to for the best relative evolution of Telecinco on the stock exchange is the important pay out that it has maintained until now: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile says that although it is early to make a decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
"We have the official compromise of giving at least 50 per cent, although we have always said much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to please our shareholders, those to whom we have already given titles with the 33% of Endemol.
According to analysts, the market is currently showing signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its estimates of profits on Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and in 2009 to 7%.
This is due, they explain, to the decline in projected revenue growth from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company lowered the forecast earnings of Antenne 3 to 4.5% in 2008 and to 7.5% in 2009.

Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force on November 1
Alongside its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the vote of Congress on the amendments incorporated into the draft in the Senate, the Government has submitted to a public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with the objective of its entry into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by Members of Parliament and Senators to negotiate and consent to the best regulation to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activity of agencies so that markets function effectively.
The MIFID, which amends the Securities Market Act, involves the modernization of financial markets, at a time when it strengthens investor protection, improves the powers of the leaders of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the different leaders of the European Union.
The new regulation will provide financial advisory services for both specialized corporate purposes and to individuals or legal entities and creates a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial advisory firms (AFIs), which merge with securities firms, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it increases the number of systems for the execution of transactions in financial instruments, so that it is possible to add multilateral trading systems and order internationalization systems to regulated secondary markets, which compete with current exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment firms to disclose to the market information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and forms of risk management and requires them to keep a record of all transactions they carry out, to facilitate control by the CNMV.
Through the Congressional Economics Commission, several changes have been added, including one that highlights that securitized debt will be considered a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has been demonstrated with what happened with the debt of high-risk U.S. mortgages (subprime).
In addition, they took advantage of the transposition of the management took advantage to legally delimit the functions that graduates in Economics can have 30 years after in 1977, was approved, the Royal Decree that delimits the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the mediator, who will work on behalf of a company, who will not require the authorization of the CNMV and who will be able to provide its services of marketing products and attracting new clients to different investment companies at the same time.
Harmonized Consumer Price Index increases by five-tenths in November to 4.1%
This indicator, which is then used by Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides an overview of the price developments in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by offering data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same process as the Harmonized Consumption Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, because it does not necessarily have to coincide with the final data that will be revealed on December 14.
"The CPI will continue at relatively high levels"
Second Vice President and Economy Minister Pedro Solbes said the 4.1% increase in the CPI in November is a "time figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes clarified in the corridors of Congress that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential regarding the monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there were fewer surprises" than in the previous month, when the Government did not face such a high increase.
"We expected a figure of around 4%," the economy minister acknowledged in relation to the figure announced today.
Virgin plans to recover 42,000 million euros over three years with Northern Rock
Northern Rock deposits have fallen to more than 50 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>12,000 million since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At that time, it was amassing record deposits of over <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 million, a figure that gradually fell in two and a half months due to the distrust of its clients and despite the 100% guarantee of this money that the Government has offered and that it will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the organization with its financial trading brand Virgin Money, needs to seize around a quarter of the revenues of the British banks that will be deposited in the next three years to obtain that remaining 18,000 million pounds until reaching the goal of 30,000 million.
The mogul group Richard Branson, known for its loud advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named the offer of the Virgin association, in which three other companies participate, including his favorite to save him from bankruptcy.
Totana Mayor Arrested for Alleged Urban Corruption
The Guardia Civil arrested the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (of the Popular Party) today early in the morning because of his alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot discovered this week.
In addition, one of the city council's secretaries and the municipality's chief of police were also arrested.
José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo replaced me last May Juan Morales, current right-wing MP, and until then municipal councilor of the city hall, and according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Channel, could be the "leader" of this plot.
The officers continue to search the municipal premises and those of the Urban Planning Council and the possibility of further stops is not ruled out in the next few hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the urban corruption plot, discovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As was indicated yesterday by the SER Channel to the lawyer of the deputy of the 'people's party' Juan Morales, he was arrested on leaving the house of Morales with important documentation in his possession related to the plot.
In addition, according to sources of the investigation, the object of the investigation is the alleged collection of commissions from Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a construction company in Galicia to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight detainees.
Bono agrees to lead the candidacy of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo and to preside over the Congress if they win the elections
Former Defense Minister José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, to lead the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the next general elections and to be President of the Congress in the event that the Socialists win the general elections.
So the organisational secretary of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced it during a press conference after the meeting that took place this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The head of the Executive justified the offer made to the former minister because "it is important to count on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he stressed that "yes it seems" that the politician from La Manche will be the candidate of the socialist group that will preside over the Congress if the socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n as president of the Congress, who made public on November 15 his decision not to run for the next general election and to abandon his political career to devote himself to the fight against climate change in the academic context.
The former minister acknowledged that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he abandoned him two years ago.
In addition, he noted that although citizens already know who will be the economic vice-president if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce the one who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches the post, Bono hopes to turn the House into "a house of respect and not insult or scream" and make it "more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes it seems regrettable that the only place in Madrid where one cannot speak quietly and calmly is the Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate on some occasions has been interrupted 26 times."
In the same way, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n and "his know-how" and he did not want to act as if he was already occupying his post so as not to fall, as he pointed out, into what his opponents might consider "a domination".
A Climate Propaganda
Since the anti-climate change movement is subjecting both skeptics of its predictions and those prioritizing other political and social battles to merciless persecution, it must demonstrate iron coherence.
This is especially the case for a leader of the movement who is president of the Government like Zapatero and who believes that this fight is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and who even proposes to sign a "new contract for the planet".
This approach obliges him to explain why the action, or inaction, of his Government has made a decisive contribution to ensuring that Spain is at the head of the European Union in the non-implementation of the Kyoto Protocols.
Who is responsible for the non-execution, in which sectors it occurred and why his Government, that of the contract with the planet, did not avoid it.
In addition, he must clearly explain to the Spanish what measures he will take to curb climate change.
What businesses will be affected, what habits of citizens will need to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings will we be forced to make, what economic consequences will this cause.
That is, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has been and will be no explanation.
Precisely because it is about sacrificing and paying.
The measures against climate change, the real measures, are unpopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Up to one-hundredth of the essence suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party seemed to Zapatero reading so dangerous that he hastened to deny it.
That is to say, it is about saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with slogans empty of any real consequence.
With phrases that have impact, commissions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for election campaigns who does not speak, who does not denounce and who does not demand, beautifies meetings and inspires tenderness.
Provided that this is limited only to being a purely virtual contracting party and that does not claim that we move by bicycle or refresh ourselves with the fan.
Totana Mayor and Local Police Chief Arrested for Alleged Urban Corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the City Hall and a hotel contractor suspected of possible urban crimes, the sources of the investigation said today.
The municipal councillor was arrested at his home and taken to the town hall, where at the moment many agents met, who also presented themselves to the municipal councillor of Urbanism and the municipal company of management of Industrial Land and Housing.
These three judgments are in addition to the six judgments made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land to urbanize them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 homes, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested but are charged in the judicial investigation, which the Tribunal No. 1 of Totana investigates.
The first six detainees have now gone to court.
According to the sources, Totana's former municipal councillor and currently an autonomous MP for the PP party, Juan Morales, is targeted by the investigation.
In addition, the ex-wife, owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was imputed, as well as the current fiancée of the former city councilor, who resides in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and the entrepreneur of Vigo (Galicia) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigr<0xC3><0xA1>n (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, agency of the Nuaria Group, and through which the bribes were allegedly made.
The investigation is carried out by the Group of Urban Crimes of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the gendarmerie whose agents, in addition to the arrests, have carried out eleven inspections, the majority in companies related to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
As a result, only one person was arrested in Totana, in short, the owner of a well-known poultry business in the region, who may have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 housing units, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company has acquired in Totana 2.2 million square meters of land that have been requalified and its project would suppose to double the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group is made up of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which deal with real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the car parks of Vigo in the streets of Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, Venezuela and the square of Fernando el Cat<0xC3><0xB3>lico; Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with yesterday’s commentary in Finland’s most important newspaper (certainly the leading PISA news above the educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that there appeared, curiously, the critique of Blackburn’s book:
"The content of the Philosophy course has challenged public opinion as a consequence of the tragedy of the Jokela school.
The culprit of the dead, a baccalaureate student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Counselor in charge of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded that the professors adopt a critical attitude towards Plato on what is written in the pages of the daily Helsingin Sanomat and he affirmed that studying Nietzsche is not indispensable in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in high schools.

A colleague passes the information on the introduction into the Criminal Code of offences on downloads on the Internet:
A. The downloading of a song would be a crime punishable by a penalty of six months to a year.
On the other hand, theft in a CD-store for a value of less than 400 euros is only considered a fault (Article 623.1).
B. Theft in a store for a value of up to 1,000 euros is already considered a crime, but the penalty is less than that imposed for downloading (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is less than that imposed for the download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the traffic of compact discs.
Participation in a tumultuous fight involves a sentence of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Criminal Code) and the trafficking of CDs would involve a sentence of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted and unauthorised films is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).

My treating doctor told me about one of his articles on strange research titled: 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others get less'.
That is to say, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of the workers depends on what the colleagues earn.
The study was carried out using tomographic magnetic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Neurocognition Imaging Group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: “The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his companion failed.”
The researchers observed that when the two people guessed that they were receiving the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one of them was receiving twice as much, the activation was greater.
I don't know if that conclusion required so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly prosecuting Balkan war criminals for the past eight years since the prosecution of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a bitter taste, because the main perpetrators of the murder of Srebrenica - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died - former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are in the list whose title is taken from the documentary by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach, 'The Carla List' (2006, not screened exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, which follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York who prosecutes criminals on the run and pressures the governments involved to narrow the circle.
Which insurance is right for me?
Automobile insurance, which covers the driver in the event of possible accidents, involves a significant expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, gender, age of the driver's license, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use made of it, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
And it is that, choosing the right auto insurance, is even more difficult than choosing the model of the vehicle.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is materialized by an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium granted and in return it becomes responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a claim.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, seniority of the driver's license, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use made of it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so that the higher the probability of an accident, the higher the odds to pay.
It is for this reason that people over the age of 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, since statistics show that these people have a lower claim rate due to their prudence.
Similarly, using censuses, companies have concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and therefore the probability of having an accident.
By increasing the frequency, the probability increases.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when determining the price of the premium.
This is why the driver must study the situation carefully to choose the auto insurance that best suits his profile.
Here we will expose the most significant variables when choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers him a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 face a variety of disadvantages when it comes to contracting insurance at an affordable price, such as low driving experience and seniority of the driver's license.
While the ideal for being well insured is full-risk insurance, other, more economical options exist.
The most forward-thinking drivers can opt for all-risk insurance with deductible, so that they get insurance coverage at all-risk but at a more affordable price.
This form of agreement implies that the customer pays part of the amount of the claim.
"The part of the amount of the claim that the customer pays will be established based on the value of the premium, which will be higher the amount will be lower," Luis Noguera, the head in Spain of First Europa, online insurance broker, specifies.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer provides protection to deal with damage caused to third parties, but by those caused on his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
One piece of advice.
If you are under 25 try to be careful and avoid claims as much as possible, since this will affect the bonus, which can reduce the price of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the basic fare that the company owns.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic tariff.
"The bonuses and sanctions will depend on the company and the profit of it.
If the company has had a good year it will be able to afford to increase the bonuses ", clarifies Noguera.
Beyond the age of 25, this becomes easier for drivers when they make a contract with an insurance, since the loss rate is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
It is for this reason that it is better to choose all-risk insurance with deductible.
“Normally young people cannot take advantage of the experience previously acquired after an accident,” said the director of the European company in Spain and adds that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, once the ‘fear of the novice’ has passed.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is preferable that he negotiates insurance at all risk, as long as his economic situation allows it.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers to be the people with the lowest claim rate, because the surcharges will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be an all-risk insurance with deductible (may be 300 euros), or an extended third-party insurance from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured has a high level of bonus.
“They have a more relaxed driving and they have a greater purchasing power to allow themselves the luxury to assume a larger amount of franchises,” judges Luis Noguera.
For retirees, all-risk insurance with a deductible is preferable (this being 150 euros), or extended third-party insurance when the insurer has a high level of subsidy.
It must be said that motor insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible accidents, but also because it represents a significant expense, that is why it is fundamental to properly study the insurance that suits us most according to our personal situation.
Celtic will try to win a point in Milan to reach the round of 16
AC Milan and Celtic Glasgow are competing next Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point they are missing to reach their respective goals in the Champions League closure, as it serves the Italians to be first and the Scots to qualify.
The Italians have totaled ten points and they have already qualified during the fifth day thanks to a draw in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but he still needs another point to ensure that Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and who receives Benfica who has four, does not pass him.
These two Group D games will be played a week before the sixth day ends, as AC Milan are due to play in the semi-finals of the Club World Cup in Japan on December 13 in search of a place for the December 16 final.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the draw at the Giuseppe Meazza stadium seems to be the most expected result, although both teams will try to come out victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic Glasgow knows that by winning he would remain first and ensure a better crossing in the eighth round.
A defeat by Gordon Strachan's team could be enough to qualify if Shakhtar Donetsk does not win, but it will not be able to computer only on this since with nine points the game returns to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanese will try to poison the evening to the Scots, who have good hopes of qualifying for the eighth round for the second time in the Champions League, after being beaten during the last edition by a goal of Kaka during overtime (1-0).
While waiting for the Rossoneri to win, the triumph would only come to Shakhtar, in case Celtic loses, to qualify for the eighth round of the finals to continue the UEFA Champions League.
And it is that Benfica, although it is last and without opportunities to continue the European competition, could reach third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls opened in Vancouver, Canada, in front of about 20,000 spectators, their first tour since the band disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) stated shortly before starting their concert at GM Place in Vancouver that the group meeting was "brilliant".
Around 20,000 people sold out tickets to attend the concert, which was the subject of a video that tells the story of the band that raged in the late 1990s.
The meeting and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album that resumes their main successes as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which EMI publishes in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls took to the stage showing off the bracelets that Posh Spice’s husband, British footballer David Beckham, had given them.
The athlete was in the crowd that filled the GM Place, even though Victoria had banned him a few days before.
Before the show began, Victoria Beckham remarked that the British footballer “didn’t see our costumes so I’m nervous because I don’t know what he’s going to think of the show.”
Sporty Spice, who left the group in 1998 "because of the differences between us" and who caused the group to disband two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a press interview, two hours before the show began.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous but I saw that people's feelings changed, the Spice Girls' feelings changed.
And I thought why not, I’m glad I made a decision,” Chisholm said of the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, “things have settled and we appreciate each other a lot.”
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girl last performed in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
When they arrived at the airport, an army of baby sitters was waiting for them.
They have five and seven sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will perform in California (USA), San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5-7).
The exhibition will take place in Madrid on December 23rd.
The new gas deal between Russia and Ukraine is a wake-up call.
A dispute over the price of gas is fermenting between Ukraine and Russia, thus increasing the risk of repercussions on oil exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are carried by pipelines, and each pipeline is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev has announced that if Russia raises the cost of fuel, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two had caused a decrease in supplies to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, Russia’s gas-supplying monopoly, tried in vain to find an agreement on the cost of Russian gas supplied to Ukraine for the year 2008.
Gazprom said it would increase its prices to Ukraine as it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts said this would result in a 40 percent increase in the costs of imports from Gazprom for Ukraine.
“It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the talks, remembering that we are a country through which most of the gas passes,” Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinkh told Reuters news agency.
“The fluctuations in gas costs would probably be related to our discussions about transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine.”
The last major altercation between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006 caused the interruption of Gazprom supplies to Ukraine.
This led to a drop in exports to Western Europe, thereby increasing prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union's supplies.
Russia has the largest gas stockpiles, although most of them are still underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom completes its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health “must control its foreign employees.”
The Scottish Ministry of Health needs to improve checks on its extra-community employees to check if they have criminal records, the oversight committee said.
The Revisor General's warning, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was involved in the June attack at Glasgow Airport.
Mr. Black also expressed concern that the Scottish Ministry of Health does not have any specific data on the number of people it employs overseas.
However, his report highlighted other decisive checks, which were carried out correctly on a sample of employees from five health authorities.
The reviser general made checks on extra-community personnel following the Glasgow airport attack.
Bilal Addullah, 28, a doctor of Iraqi origin at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after he crashed his jeep into the gates of the main terminal.
He was one of three doctors who were filmed at the Old Bailey in October, suspected of being involved in various attempts to blow up cars in the UK.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas staff, to be sure of the validity of their qualifications, experiences, and work permits for the UK.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses the Scottish Disclosure to carry out previous criminal checks, the agency has no right to obtain such information outside of Britain.
Among the many warnings, the Auditor General's report now states that committees are required to confront the Bureau of Criminal Control, thus allowing employers to undertake checks on various countries.
"Although we have found that some personnel information has been verified, this is not done every time," the report said.
Mr Black said that the Scottish Ministry of Health carries out most of the pre-employment checks it would do itself, but he also added: “Our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information on certain overseas personnel is available to health services.
Peter Terry, president of BMA Scotland, said it was “extremely unlikely” that pre-employment checks could identify employees likely to commit future terrorist acts.
"The report suggests that the pre-employment checks currently being carried out are working well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings could bring any added value."
Scottish health authorities said they employed 1,161 people from overseas, mostly doctors and nurses.
But the reviser general pointed out that these figures certainly need to be revised upwards, in part because of problems with the identification of staff members with permanent contracts, who may or may not choose to remain in our country.
The investigation has shown that the current procedures for controls by the health authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian, are quite adequate.
These checks are carried out on passport, work permit and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently revising its policy and its system of pre-employment checks for overseas health service personnel.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: “I was excited to do this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport.”
She added that the Scottish Government, allied with the health committees, would carefully consider the warnings set out in the report due to be published next month, and would commit to ensuring better implementation of the recently updated pre-employment checks, which are valid for all employees, including people from overseas.
Joy Division dominates the Oscars.
Control, the biopic of Joy Division’s latest singer, Ian Curts, won 5 awards, including Best Picture, at the British Independent Film Oscars.
The trophies were also awarded to star Sam Riley, who worked in a store until he was cast as Curtis in the film, directed by Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Ms. Judi Dench was named Best Actress for her role in the thriller "Notes on a Scandal"
Daniel Craig, the Bond star, won the Variety Award for allowing the British film to be in the international spotlight.
The awards were distributed during the ceremony at London's Round House.
Control recounts Curtis's rise to success with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, aged 23.
The black-and-white film, whose music was directed by The Killers, David Bowie and New Order, was shot on a budget of just 3 million Sterling.
But the Dutch photographer, best known for his iconic cover of U2’s Joshua Tree album, won two awards, the first for best director and the second for best debutant director.
Rock was also awarded the Best Documentary Award for Julien Temple’s film about Clash singer Joe Strummer.
The Best Actor award was given to Viggo Mortensen for his portrayal of the driver of a Russian mob boss in David Cronenberg’s London-based thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, renowned for his tough character performances, won the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old director, who has shot films like Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the sequel to Indiana Jones, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive this award named in honor of star Harris, the protagonist in Camelot and Harry Potter, who passed away in 2002.
“Richard Harris and Albert Finney have given people like me access to cinema,” he said.
“I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice.”
“I was admiring this great current actor, I was extremely honored.”
The independent film Oscars, better known as "Les Bifas" are awarded by a jury of directors, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa fans and bosses include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia blocks 208 terror plots
Saudi Arabia yesterday revealed that it has arrested 208 militants involved in organizing cells manipulating an imminent attack on an oil site, as well as attacks on clergy and armed forces.
The state television of the world's largest exporter of oil, said that one of the cells of missile smugglers.
Al Qaeda sympathizers have staged a campaign against the allied monarchy in the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign resident, was planning an attack on an oil site in the Eastern Province, the TV newspaper said.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a group of 35,000 troops to protect the sites, following a failed Al Qaeda attack in 2006 against the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper, citing a statement from the interior minister, said 18 of those arrested belong to a cell run by a “missile launch expert” who has infiltrated the country.
It is said that the militants were planning the counter-band of eight missiles in the kingdom.
22 people among the detainees appear to have plotted the murder of clergymen and armed forces.
The government has urged clerics to do more against Saudi-led Iraq, to join al Qaeda militants fighting the Allied Forces and against the allied Shiite Muslim government in the United States, considered heretical according to the hardline Saudi Sunny.
Al Qaeda activists believe that in Saudi Arabia, many clergymen have collaborated with the authorities to support the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The activists, encouraged by calls against the pro-Western Saudi government by Osama bin Laden, a Saudi-born leader of Al Qaeda, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
Significant efforts have been made by the armed forces over the past five... months,” the interior minister’s spokesman told state television.
Among the detainees are 16 Medina members organized into a “media cell” to promote “takfiri thought”, the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that supports the use of violence against infidel and apostate Muslims.
Among the detainees, 32 people are accused of subsidizing the activists.
The climate of Venus could reveal the future of Earth.
Scientists said yesterday that Venus has certainly been a pleasant planet to live on.
Data from the orbiting European spacecraft showed that the planet is certainly twice as small as Earth, contrary to what was previously thought.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
These two worlds are practically the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus could have had Earth-like conditions, and could even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation combined with slower rotation, has led Venus to a whole other kind of evolution.
Today the planet is deprived of water, is ravaged by hurricanes and lightning storms and has a temperature surface warm enough to melt lead.
The findings of Venus Express, the European Space Agency’s probe, which has been studying the planet for a year, offer a sad glimpse into Earth’s potential future due to catastrophic climate changes.
University of Oxford physics professor Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: “We are beginning to understand why the climate of Venus is so different from that of Earth, although the planets themselves are practically similar.
“Our new data allows us to establish a scenario that billions of years ago, Venus was originally identical to Earth, perhaps even with a habitable surface.”
Enriched uranium seized by the police.
A kilo of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was seized by Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police officer said three people were arrested and the equipment is currently being analyzed.
He did not confirm that it was indeed uranium, but revealed that the commodity would be worth $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
Still open to everything
Mitt Romney said he was not up to it as a presidential candidate, to answer the questions of a snowman.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates have finally agreed to participate in the You Tube debate, during which many ordinary voters who have recorded their questions submit them to the candidates.
On Wednesday night, November 28, none of the questions asked were as ridiculous as the one from another You Tube debate, when a snowman asked Democrats their position on global warming.
But this time, the questions and answers largely reflected the conditions of the Republican party, which is a candidate for the next election.
It is not known on what criteria, the producers of CNN, who sponsored the debate, chose the You Tube clips to show to the aspiring candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest on a single topic, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strong subjects for Republicans.
CNN asked some voters to call when they would hear fun things: The board noted increases in approvals when candidates spoke out rudely.
The hardest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney, who leads the important early elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his tenure as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts, of employing illegal immigrants in his home.
The two fighters became particularly ferocious when asked if they would be willing to promote “amnesia” (offering illegal immigrants regular status and the opportunity to become citizens).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, have managed to deepen the subject.
None of them have the chance to be elected, but both remain in the race, perhaps thanks to the fact that they have begun to fight immigration before and more incisively than the others.
In general, candidates, at least with regard to immigration, have the same views: more rigid borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This issue, coupled with concerns in particular over the Chinese-made toxic toys case or other fears of the outside world, encourages Republicans to forget, or minimize, the divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate became particularly embarrassing when other topics were raised.
Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether putting water in the nose should be considered torture.
One speaker asked whether the candidates believed in the entire content of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even though he is not sure to believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another speaker asked if Jesus would have been in favor of the death penalty.
It was not expected that Mike Huckabee, – in Iowa’s pole position in a recent election, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism – would declare that the death penalty is painful though necessary.
When they insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favor, he laughed and said that Jesus was too chic to run for office.
The human race remains unusually open to everything.
Mr. Huckabee’s comeback in Iowa coincides with the recent prodigious subsidy research conducted by libertarian Ron Paul, and the whistles during Wednesday’s debate.
These two emerged from nothing, thanks to the fact that the two protégés of the party could not agree on who was the best known and most traditionalist candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party early and convincingly thanks to a successful message about American greatness bringing the leaders together.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Pains of Labour
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole to sink into; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Given the trend of British scandals, this one is not particularly juicy.
No decorations sold, no Parisian hotel bills from politicians, no extra conjugal finger sucked.
But a revelation attests that a wealthy businessman would have masked for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1.3m), which the party would not have declared: A new battle that Gordon Brown would have done well.
Two months ago, the prime minister backtracked on his election bill, foolishly insulting British intelligence proclaiming that opinion polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped instead to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democrat leader, has said that the terrifying Mr. Brown has transformed himself from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The takeover of Northern Rock, a struggling bank on the brink of crack, has demonstrated a policy flaw and poor judgment in an emergency.
Inadequate proposals in favour of changing the tax code have provoked a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data by the tax authorities has revealed an incredible administrative turmoil.
A trio of retired generals launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting reductions in military spending: they proclaimed that being defense minister is for them a part-time job.
At present, the suspicion of shady donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour secretary general (and his former chief of vigilance) have caused them to resign.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is inevitably heading for the exit.
However, governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People do not like politicians, and do not trust them, but generally leave their doubts aside when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a prime minister cannot improve things, or even govern for a long time, when he risks suspension: the public administration is no longer functioning; the cabinets of ministers are taking stock; the press is looking for bad stories; and the government is going on the defensive and without any purpose anymore.
In a sense, Mr. Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he would like to repudiate Tony Blair, he was still his senior lieutenant.
The problems related to Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to Mr. Brown's decisions when he was Chancellor of the British Treasury.
And even if he is not directly involved in Blair’s misfortunes, such as the long investigation into the party’s “cash money for members of the House of Lords,” voters might think otherwise.
But Mr. Brown's difficult situation is not as tragic as it seems.
The gaffes aren’t as monstrous as Tories party members make it seem.
As in Mr. Bean, there are no victims or scams.
And the remedy, though painful, could be to materialize Mr. Brown’s long-standing Stalinist tendencies, in favor of a trustworthy and slightly brutal government.
The new political donation scandal is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very particular character, who compares his donations to charity, said he did not want any public recognition of his charity.
He may have his opinion, but it is not up to him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of big grantees of politicians are clear, and they exist for a good reason: The public has a right to know who contributes to the success of those who will govern the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he was aware of Mr. Abrahams's programs, not knowing that it was illegal, will therefore have to be questioned, as will Jon Mendlesohn, the head of grant collections who had talked about the questionable donations in October.
But so far Mr. Brown is not involved: There is nothing to suggest that he was aware of these steps, even though most of the payments made were made as a result of his arrival in government in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half of it.
He quickly condemned his party's legislative flaw, but did not draw attention to the fact that decision-making power rests on something he knows well, resorting to a committee of inquiry on the subject consisting of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to learn are not complicated.
And if the law has been violated, it is the responsibility of the police.
In addition, there are many other things that Mr. Brown must do, such as find a permanent chair for the independent committee of Public Life Standards, without a leader for six months, and prepare a good reform on the financial status of political parties.
This would force the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to collaborate with the Tories, which could lead it to give up its special financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a supporter such as Mr. Brown.
But he should face some partisan facts.
The Conservative Party now has a good election advantage; it has two years to win back voters, and the only way to win is to demonstrate impeccable integrity and solid skills.
Card scams.
Would the Mortgage Crisis Contaminate the American Credit Card Market?
When there is blood in the water, it is normal to see fins swirling around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is going through a critical phase, predators are targeting the U.S. credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs believe that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the contagion extends from mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in fees and insolvency rates, which measure the unrecoverable or non-recoverable balance sheet shares more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in its consumer credits, in part because of the weakness of cardholders.
It’s too early to panic.
Fees and insolvencies are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the insolvency rate of 3.89% in the third quarter is almost one point lower than its historical average.
The deterioration in rates is partly explained by technical factors.
A change of laws in 2005 in the United States regarding personal bankruptcy caused a sharp fall in bankruptcy records, which in turn caused heavy losses for credit cards; the number of records (and therefore insolvency rates) could increase even if borrowing conditions were to worsen.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the amount of monthly debt that consumers have to pay.
and confidence in the security of credit card capital is quite strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the 2007 broadcast volume will be 25% higher than last year.
The direct infection links between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers may prefer to increase their debts now that fair mortgages have disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to cash flow rather than wealth value, and so the fall in real estate prices has not necessarily led to a change in borrowers' credibility.
They could even bring benefits to issuers of credit securities.
Consumer premiums for mortgage payments fall if properties cost less than the value of the loan; as a result, credit card debt would become a priority to repay the whole.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgages and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid recovery in equities.
“We’re not going to wake up one morning and reevaluate all the borrowing,” said Gary Perlin, director of Capital One.
If a financial disaster in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a high risk of a significant decline.
If lower real estate prices and a contraction in the credit market drive America into recession, the industry will certainly face a macabre future.
Pay attention to the dorsal fins.
British bankers plead guilty to the Enron case.
The three British bankers who were to go to testify their roles in relation to a fraud committed by Enron's former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, pleading guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew first pleaded not guilty to seven counts of alleged collusive fraud in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam in order to enrich themselves in spite of their employees.
They are expected to appear in court in January.
But during a hearing presided over by U.S. Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., they all pleaded guilty to fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland's PLC group, have become famous across Britain because of extradition proceedings that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case remains an open question for this investigation launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges brought against them in 2002 made it clear to Fastow that he was the subject of the government's investigation into the Enron debacle.
The charges against the bankers, dubbed the "Natwest Three," claim to have come to Houston in 2000 to stage a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his former right-hand man, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, who was the director of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him rig the bankruptcy proceedings.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had assessed its interest in the subsidiary as zero, but in fact the three British already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought interest from the subsidiary bank for <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
Bankers paid $250,000 to Kopper as interest for this company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in truth this $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the accusations, the bankers would have obtained $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others would have earned $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to his active role in two conspiracies in the Enron debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow endures a six-year incarceration in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is incarcerated for three years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British were released following the payment of a deposit of $1 million each, forcing them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, formerly the seventh largest national company, bankrupted in December 2001 after years of accounting rigging, could no longer hide its billions in debt or even offer its phony speculations as profitable.
The collapse caused thousands of layoffs, more than $60 billion in market value loss and more than $2 billion in loss for retirement plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the collapse of the company.
Skilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other misdemeanours were in vain because of his death from a heart attack last year.
Not under, not outside of Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and possessing sufficient fuel range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts from $54 million.
But this is only a small change for some Russians.
“It can carry up to 18 passengers,” said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
“Even if no one really needs as many seats as this is more of a family aircraft or for the president of a company.”
Mr. Firer was present at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaires Salon, a four-day consumer-incentive orgy held in a huge exhibition center around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their booths, hoping to arouse the interest of the new rich Russians for their varied products, ranging from mahogany yachts to diamond-filled cars like those of 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer was scrutinizing a bright orange Porsche, on display next to his stand.
“It’s a nice car, but nothing comparable to our product,” he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market.”
“Thanks to an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be rolling in black gold, like Dallas.”
“We experienced the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans got so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialists,” said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar in the Davis Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudis in the 1970s, the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerge as the world’s largest spenders.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another place in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to follow for the sale of luxury goods to markets such as Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which is owned by The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth $282 billion, according to the Forbes list listing the richest people.
In addition, two-thirds of the rich are made up of 103,000 Russian millionaires who are globally worth $670 billion, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, conducted by economists at the center of economic and financial research.
(The World Bank stated that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians were living below the poverty line.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that’s why we’re all here,” said Nicole Marais, a representative of London jeweller Davis Morris.
She participated in the show for the first time in the company of the Russian distributor, The Jewellery Group of Soho.
“Women are all well prepared and men are worth a fortune.”
Walking in the living room on Sunday evening, the two real estate agents put on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 declare to be like their customers, millionaires.
“I was looking at the cars and trying to choose between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,” said Ms Yumatova, who grabbed her haute couture dress like a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The show seems above all to be aimed at the new rich, the kind of Russian brand buyers willing to line up in the corks to come to a huge warehouse where Cadillac Escalades, platinum canifs, Mövenpick ice cream, custom pool tables, Dubai apartments and Gund teddy bears are on display.
The public could buy the tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
“Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and best brands,” said Mr. Gijrath, posing proudly at the Royal Dutch porcelain-making Delf factory stand, in front of a hand-made Raimbrant mural on blue tiles.
“The Russians are more interested in bling bling.”
Indeed, sellers have stated here that Russians with old capital (10 to 15 years are too much by Russian standards) have already moved from bright logos to some kind of limited edition brand that could not be sold at the show.
Despite this, thousands of people, whether millionaires, emissaries of millionaires or tourists, walk the exhibition every day.
Some even buy.
On the first night of the exhibition last Thursday, Roman Ershow, the CEO of King Koil beds, said he had sold two sets of silk, cashmere, and cotton mattresses inlaid with gold threads.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales manager of A1 motorcycle, a company that equips cars with state-of-the-art alarm systems, also said he sold a Russian millionaire, the shiny orange Porsche, for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said he would sell three bracelet-like cars, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be inlaid with Swarovski crystals to look like a roulette wheel.
The set of four costs $22,000.
“The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich leather, or a picture of his wife made of cubic zirconium, won’t necessarily drive with such tires,” Karapetian said.
He will definitely keep it in his garage containing 30 or 40 vehicles already.”
Even though many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase “Russian millionaire” is not on the agenda, given the rise in real estate prices here.
“If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash,” he said.
“There’s more you could think of.”
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the stand of Alliance Continental, a Russian wealth management company.
The company has erected four booths representing British telephone booths, filled with mass counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing director, said his team printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire show.
Passers-by arrested for throwing masses of tickets, ask their friends to photograph them on their mobile, in the middle of this false wealth or pocketing a few million.
“You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,” Karyev said.
Unapproved Surgeon Suspected of Homicide in New Jersey
It was the eve of Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked out the window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant and observed an ambulance that had just stopped at the doors of the white Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
Then came the police patrol.
and then another.
“Then I saw the medical vehicle stop,” Livingston, a restaurant manager, said Wednesday.
That's when I realized someone was dead.
Authorities would then learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Investigators are now trying to determine if the cause of his death is due to a gesture performed by an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon, who has not yet been identified by police, resident at 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have not yet determined the causes of Ms. Arroyo's death, but they are confidently awaiting the results of toxicological tests that, alas, will take time, but which should help solve this mysterious death that has saddened the high ranks of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant to Police Director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious,” McCarthy said of Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview Wednesday.
She was like a pit bull.
“She would have done anything to protect me.”
Mr. McCarthy said Ms. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she leaves behind two sons aged 14 and 11, as well as a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsj, spokesman for the Union County Public Prosecutor's Office, Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives were trying to determine whether Ms. Arroyo died from unauthorized surgery.
“This is a possibility to consider.”
“The investigation continues.”
Authorities said they arrived at her home at around 3 p.m.
and found Melle arroyo on the sofa.
She was pronounced dead.
A little over a week has passed since, and authorities have said little about the investigation or even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh could not confirm whether Ms. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to figure out if a part of the house was being used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Ms. Castro's home where a faded rose tree rests in the narrow cemetery in front, and a Dalmatian barked in the back.
A blue canister called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a vanilla substitute in cooking and for perfumes, lay in a shed, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two all-terrain bikes hanging on the sides.
McCarthy said that since arriving in Newark 25 years ago at the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping her navigate the new city and abandon her framed political culture.
“She said, ‘You have to pay attention to this, you have to pay attention to this,’” he said.
“She was there when I arrived, and still there when I left.
“It was embarrassing”
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will lower rates linked to the buzz of the global stock market.
Shares exploded on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped the Federal Reserve would have tried to calm credit conditions, later lowering interest rates promoted by the calming statements of the vice president of the US central bank.
Stock markets are exploding in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, No. 2 after Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, declared that those who decide, must be “flexible and pragmatic” in their actions in the turbulent financial markets.
In an obvious effort to reassure irritable markets given these new credit-related tensions, Kohn said the recent turbulence has in part “reversed some improvements in the functioning of the market at the end of September and October.
Should this harsh turbulence persist, it would increase the likelihood of further tightening financial conditions for homeowners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into U.S. markets, and that further interest rate cuts could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also calmed Wall Street down with even worse news about the U.S. economy, such as the biggest drop in property sales for October.
The repercussions of this financial turmoil have been accentuated following the declaration of Bear Stearns, an investment bank, announcing that it will lay off 650 people, that is, 4% of its staff, to reduce the costs to compensate for the heavy losses due to the losing bets on real estate loans.
Only 20 positions are planned in Londres where the bank employs 1500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 331 points, 2.55% to 13,289.40, while the largest index, the S&P 500, rose 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index gained 165.5 points or 2.7% concluding at 6306.2 adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 to the value of British companies.
The German Dax index rose by 2.6% and the French CAC40 rose by 2.3%.
Previously, the reappearance of credit difficulties in the markets was highlighted following the strong demand for an auction of monthly tri-funds from the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European commercial banks at a heavy rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and inject further funds into London’s financial markets, causing credit tensions, has caused British banks’ monthly “Libor” borrowing rates to cause their highest growth since last September, at 6.59% following a sharp rise since November 12.
England faced a call for judgment over the criticisms of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are faced with two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be England’s No. 6 drummer at Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more importantly in such a broad context as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the coaches who was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, make their decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, the President and CEO of England, is beginning to fill out the application forms to become a national coach, at least part-time.
Whoever fails to win No. 6 will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and so is sport.
It is never easy to annihilate what allows one man to reach the top of his profession while another will never reach beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck more than for lack of skill.
It is not only in cricket that selection is difficult, because in the end, the judgment remains subjective.
Is now the right time for Bopara to emerge?
Is it just in relation to Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, who to choose between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubby"?; both, new executives having obtained good degrees, professionals, should be promoted: but there is room for only one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricketer unless he is given at least one chance?
Figures are important in decisions, but so are opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricketer must capture the captain's eye, at the same time he must take the door and a drummer must be lucky to touch the one-day cricketer.
But capturing the eyes of selectors is much more complicated.
Many did better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first Test, even though Stephen Harmison declared himself fit and continued to train to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class doors over 33 laps to win a spot.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 at the same average, but both have already experienced their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to deliver again.
Whether it will be Shah or Bopara who will play at the Asgiriya Stadium is only a matter of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build a man’s career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and did well in the first, with five doors and 40 laps, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was also struggling to emerge, who managed to become the primordial cricketer of the Test, and this despite the fact that his double score against Australia in Australia may still be underestimated.
Probability predicts that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at the Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and foster Shah's greatest experience against young Bopara's exuberance.
Both have good arguments.
In favour of Shah, his brilliant and considerable start to the innings of the 88 Test in Bombay, 32 cents first class against six for Bopara, who at 22 is seven years younger, and his excellent ranking at the launch.
But Shah only made ten laps in his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test at Lord, his Middlesex player city, and that the immediate rejection by the coaches when Vaughan again fit, claiming his place for the next game, seems to have afflicted his so obvious momentum in Bombay.
Unlike him, the Essex player is full of joie de vivre.
Nothing frightens him on a cricket pitch and he exaggerated when he recently capped a 4x4 during a presentation by Volkswagen, sponsor of England.
He reported only minor injuries, was shocked, although the first thing he did was take his Vodafone (sponsor of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who was looking at him from a distance, to ask him if “had he seen this?”
Bopara is by far the best drummer, his fast pace allows him to do services that suit him, and that he beats with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Is this the real art of selection?
I would be conducive to giving Bopara a chance, which doesn’t mean Shah shouldn’t apply if, as tea leaves suggest, he’ll be playing this weekend.
Buses bring people back to work, and to fight al Qaeda.
The first bus full of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, dumping those exiles without money or visa renewals, or others still hoping that the city has returned to normal.
Some have returned to fight against the militants who have driven them away from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival in Damascus of 800 people transported in convoys of dozens of official government buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by their means.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad,” said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came home today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and saw that the city is safer now.”
“They say the Mahdi army is no longer committing crimes!” he said, referring to the Shia militia of church activist Moqtada al-Sadr, who forced his men to step away for the time being.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Sunni-dominated Amariyah area, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime is preventing Iraqis from working.
Shia's neighbors in Amariyah called him to inform him that the militia aided by the United States, allowed to drive Al Qaeda from the west of the capital, and invited him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his home north of Baghdad because of a grenade attack after he incited citizens to rebel against al-Qaeda.
But he had to go home to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me they had set up an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and they needed me and my boys.”
“That’s why I’m coming home today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many say they have attracted the capital’s growing calm since U.S. troops arrived, and the sight of continuing formation of well-armed “involved citizen groups” working with the U.S. military to defend their neighborhood.
But others say they were forced to return because of the visa problem and the decline of the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, a father of three, expressed suspicion about the exile visas that Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, who allegedly asked the Syrian government to limit to force people to return to the country.
More than two and a half million people reportedly fled the country because of sectarian death squads.
“We didn’t have a problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and urged the government to stop giving visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq,” Sunni said.
“I can’t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house when I left.”
The decrease in violence can be partly explained by the fact that Sunnis were driven out of Shia areas and vice versa, creating places where tensions are lower.
There is concern that a sudden influx of refugees will again increase sectarian tensions and bring back fighting.
Small Saarland, good training.
The smallest federated state leads in vocational training, and even shines through the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that a deficit weighs on the Sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Sarrois, that we are not French" - this is the slogan that the smallest federated state, by self-deprecation, displays for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland training system, which is ranked fifth in the training monitor of the German Institute of Economics in Cologne.
Thus, already by tradition, the higher schools cooperate closely with the neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Saarbrücken in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies there with a double or even a triple degree.
This is evidenced by the high share of 15.6 per cent of foreign students.
The Saarland also leads the country's children to higher schools in higher than average numbers - many of them without a Gymnasium diploma.
“In the Saarland, we take advantage of the vocational training system,” says Axel Plünnecke, training expert at IW.
More than one in five young people obtain their degree in a vocational school, so the Saarland is more than seven points above the national average.
Also the possibilities of combining vocational and academic training are relatively well developed.
Given the number of inhabitants, the dual curriculum panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
This is why the Sardis Ministry of Education has forced the higher schools to a marketing campaign in the subjects of engineering sciences.
"After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in the general schools," said a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government has introduced comparison tests throughout the federated state.
In order for children to start learning earlier, the last year of cr<0xC3><0xA8>che is exempt from law - a model that in the meantime other federated states also copy.
Only future comparison studies can show whether student performance is improving sustainably.
In the PISA studies in 2003, the number of students at risk decreased from 29 to 20 per cent.
In total, however, the Saarland has not improved as much as other federated states.
The Bavarians are doing better.
And in spite of the Sardis, the knowledge of foreign languages is not measured by the PISA studies - one could otherwise earn points in this area.
Because the language of the neighbor is mandatory in high schools - even if the Sarrois are not French.
Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez adjusts the watches
In Venezuela, watches will soon tick differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chavez will raise the half-hour timer in the South American country.
In the meantime, Chavez became a caricature in Spain.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela communicated, due to a new law, the watches will be set at least four and a half hours of universal time.
In this way, the South American country obtains a time zone that does not exist in any other state of the world.
The anti-American Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez justified his position, among other things, by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of time zones into full hours.
In addition, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez announced Wednesday (local time) the cessation of relations with the neighboring country, Colombia, due to a case of hostages.
The left-wing nationalist announced that as long as conservative <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would have no relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do it, already only because of my dignity," Chavez said, urging constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote by referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The trigger for this dispute was Uribe's decision to withdraw from Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez the mandate for negotiations on the release of hostages with the Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe allegedly "speaked in the face" of Venezuela with this decision, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez had criticized Sunday.
In Spain Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez is also in every mouth.
A new cell phone ringtone is raging in the country: "Why don't you shut up" is the phrase that already more than half a million people have downloaded from the internet.
It was pronounced by the King of Spain Juan Carlos who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was annoyed by the constant interpellations of the populists of the left and who told him to shut up.
A fall in wages threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong economic situation, a real under-value of wages is forecast to threaten German workers this year.
Experts have cited all sorts of reasons to explain their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees are expected to expect a real decrease in their payroll in 2007 compared to the previous year.
"The fault lies in the weak wage growth, the rise in the Value Added Tax and the rise in food and energy prices," Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research told the Bild newspaper.
There could also be new charges for unemployment insurance for the employee.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the planned fall in unemployment insurance by 3.3 percent for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be embarrassed to ask the Federation for credits or financial aid, in the words of the SPD politician.
It was reported Tuesday that the explosion in food and oil prices had pushed the inflation rate to its highest level in 13 years.
In total, prices increased by 3.0 percent year-over-year.
Venus is the infernal twin of Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere to life, Venus looks more like Earth than previously thought: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered flashes in the atmosphere and wind swirls at the poles, similar to those that appear in winter on Earth.
For nearly three decades, scientists have been assuming that there are flashes of lightning on Venus.
The European probe "Venus Express" has now provided proof of this - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: lightning on Venus erupts at a height of about 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California at Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous theory of cyprin, lightning would have made life appear on Earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstone of life.
This is not the case on Venus: "If there has been life, it must have been at a very ancient date in history," explains Sean Solomon of the "Carnegie Institution" in Washington.
There should be few living things on the surface of Venus today: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, sometimes there are temperatures of 500 degrees.
“Venus may be Earth’s infernal twin, but it remains a twin,” Russell said.
Why Venus, which looks so much like Earth in mass and dimensions, has been struck by such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ASE mission.
The departure of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in Venusian research, since no probes had been on the way to explore this planet since the 1980s.
According to the researchers, the most recent research results that have now been presented in several "Nature" articles not only highlight the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the commonalities with the Earth of our neighboring planet are more numerous than initially assumed.
Thus the researchers found, in addition to the wind swirls already known at the north pole, a cloud swirl at the south pole, which rotates even faster.
The phenomenon recalls the currents of air in the terrestrial hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, almost as large.
The planet called the evening or morning star revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns much slower on itself: a Venusian day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, is hardly reminiscent of Earth, scientists assume that the two planets formed under similar conditions.
On both, water accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but was lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has settled on Earth in the form of carbonate, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel’s meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler demands an end to the parties' quarrel over the Dalai Lama's welcome to the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD for the attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler cares about Germany's appearance and urges the grand coalition to end the quarrel over the Dalai Lama's welcome.
“We must not present to the outside world a divided nation on this issue,” Köhler told the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
“Human rights have universal validity, even if I have respect for the differences between cultures,” said Köhler.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensitive balance in foreign policy, stressed the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against the reproaches that it would organize a new policy of China.
The German chancellor has not distanced herself from the traditional policy of one China.
“China knows that too,” Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed his dissatisfaction with the reception of the Dalai Lama and had been attacked for this outside the CDU.
Steinmeier complained about the CDU's "frontline policy" in foreign policy.
After the Dalai Lama's reception at the Chancellery, virulent irritations were felt in German-Chinese relations.
Thus the Chinese government not only decommissioned the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to information from Spiegel, also frozen the so-called strategy dialogue of the foreign ministers of the two countries.
The head of the Chinese government, Wen Jiabao, is now demanding that German Chancellor Angela Merkel acknowledge that the Dalai Lama’s welcome was a mistake.
China refuses to allow European politicians to receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in his official functions, Wen Jiabao thus supported the Chinese position.
The Dalai Lama’s words and deeds would show that he is trying to separate Tibet and other Tibetan regions from China, which also encompasses other present-day provinces.
Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Street fights with police, gunfire, cars on fire: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Everything must be done to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not erupt in the streets with violence, the German Interior Minister demanded.
Burning barricades, busters firing at the police with shotguns: after the serious youth riots in France, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany.
We must ensure that a social explosive does not also form in our country and defuses itself in violence.
We must take this seriously," he told the "New Press" in Hanover.
Not all young individuals would be able to cope with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the federated states and the communes were already working hard to reduce the problems, Schäuble said.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
“From integration summits to conferences on Islam, it already shows its first successes.”
But it would be too early for an end to the alarm.
Schäuble points out at the same time that in the German suburbs, there are no sociological problems nor from the point of view of urbanism as in France.
In the northern Paris agglomerations, young people had engaged in serious street battles with the police over the past few nights.
In Toulouse too, cars and public buildings burned down.
Greater integration efforts on the part of the German government were required by the President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the riots in France, Kolat warned against the "effects of imitation".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
But there would still be a need to act.
Kolat emphasizes that the share of unemployed youth under 25 with an immigration background would be above average.
First and foremost, more places should be provided for training.
Kolat insisted, “We must give young people a perspective.”
The president of the Turkish communities added, however, that social control in families took place more in Germany than in France.
Many young immigrants also don’t want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat exhorted, "But we must still be careful."
"Young people should be given the opportunity to participate in work and training as soon as possible."
In the meantime, in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very quiet during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter was flying over the area with spotlights.
The authorities in charge reported three arrests as well as a few cars and trash cans burned.
Since the conference, a deployment of about 1,000 security forces ensures calm.
The police will intervene for as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburb.
On Tuesday night, nearly 80 police officers were injured in the riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The next night, troubles broke out in Toulouse.
The riots broke out after a traffic accident in which two young people had lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the Public Prosecutor's Office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of young people.
In the empire of Angela Merkel.
The chancellor’s utopian entry shows that the coalition is done with the bottom – and that there is nothing more to expect from her.
In which country does this chancellor live?
After his disheartening intervention in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor in content, it must be said: not here - not in the country that should, in the end, be governed by it.
The reproach of focusing too much on politics was repelled by Angela Merkel with a harsh and presumptuous phrase.
It's provincial, she said, and only showed by that that she doesn't want to understand what the critics want.
In Parliament, she made it clear to everyone how accurate this reproach was.
There was neither concrete interest nor little feeling for the country's problems to be felt.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: a politician in weightlessness, who flees in foreign policy and who even there remains in the near future.
For example, climate protection: in this regard, it welcomes over and over again the Heiligendam agreements, but does not say how the climate objectives should be achieved in our country.
Even self-praise - having so little modesty, the CDU leader would have refused it even two years ago.
Now she is clinging to ready-made formulas, that growth would affect people.
By doing so, she destroys her image as a pragmatist, who solves problems instead of beautifying the world.
But in the Angela cloud empire, domestic policy issues are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the concerns of low-wage workers?
He has a few extra sentences for that.
In this matter it is revealing how many times it lapses when it comes to family allowance.
Here, Merkel needs three starts to pronounce a sentence that is half-precise.
She hesitates in unfamiliar terrain, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Attack Branch
In the Youtube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a tough offensive battle – and must now fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates already erupts in the first subject.
He allegedly made New York a "refugee for illegal immigrants," Mitt Romney reproaches his adversary Rudy Giuliani.
“I would say his own house was a haven for illegals,” Giuliani replied, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of employing undocumented immigrants.
The candidates rise to the attack: as the Republican base also has no official favorites, the eight presidential candidates use the debates on CNN above all to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur movies that internet users have sent via YouTube are barely more than blowers.
“It is with this kind of isolationism that we have allowed Hitler to come to power,” McCain told his candidate Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney is also vigorously taught by Vietnam veterans, when he refuses to condemn as torture what is called "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation in which drowning is simulated.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign meanwhile go beyond the war in Iraq and the debates about torture is seen in the reactions of the St. Petersburg Common Room in Florida.
Whether conservative values are praised or future tax increases are refused, applause is rampant in the auditorium.
This is where the weaknesses of the two favorites are once again revealed.
“I made a mistake back then,” Romney said, apologizing to the base and the television audience for being an abortion advocate in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, slips into a slippery knot when asked his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civilian.
A day after his retirement as army chief, Pakistani powerman Musharraf was sworn in as president.
Thus eight years of domination by the army ended.
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the Constitution and act for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his position as head of the armed forces to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus bowed to international pressure, including that of the United States.
Eight years after his seizure of power by a bloodless coup, the former general now reigns for the first time as head of civil status.
By withdrawing from the post of commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf had decreed on November 3.
Already shortly after his inauguration Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus fulfill another demand of the West.
The country's Supreme Court, which Musharraf had occupied after the establishment of a state of emergency with lawyers from his ranks, rejected last week all appeals against the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four others were injured.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded in a street near the border of Afghanistan.
The Fathers of the Krautrock are returning.
The supergroups of Germany of the seventies are playing again: the three members of the group Harmonia took their console again in a concert in Berlin.
For their return were released recordings of their great success "Live 1974".
Already at that time they were much better known abroad.
The expected sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced on the evening poster.
Everyone has their little box in front of them, their cable and above all their buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, sits in the middle in a snow-white shirt.
He is flanked to the left by Michael Rother, a 57-year-old with a laptop and guitar.
On the right, watched by the entire auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, bends over to his console.
Everyone contributes to the noise, among others even a Beat.
And sometimes it inadvertently adds to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem to bother the men themselves.
The fact that the band Harmonia plays again has ensured some excitement among Krautrock fans.
We have the right to reveal it here: targeted polls reveal that, of course, the name reason in the collective memory of pop, but in no case in such a lasting way that this group has been missing so painfully for 32 years.
But why would the German not also have the right to celebrate his living legends of the seventies?
Especially since what is deceptively called "Krautrock" has always rained more in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Award in 2003 to the survivors of the Cologne-based group Can for their work, German pop faces interrogators were seen in the room.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked La Düsseldorf and Neu! in panegyric praise, the amazement was boundless.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped onto the Red Hot Chili Peppers stage as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration into the unknown is the only one.
The memory is therefore already taken by Harmonia, because the trio only existed for two years and that during this period, the impact power felt was much weaker than what was later attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously performed with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
We first played in the cellars below the Berlin stage.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly troubled Kraftwerk and finally made a name for himself as a guitarist with Neu!, which at the time was perhaps the most radical German band.
By 1973, however, Rother was following Cluster musicians into exile in the Weserbergland forests.
There, in an old farm of the Weser, a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the "Kommune I" community, where Roedelius had the right to be tormented as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence in the manner of Spitzweg.
There was supposedly in the trash a banner of the Harmonia Ottenstein choir and also a name for the art.
Many hold Harmonia away from this.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the next "De Luxe".
Because as serene and modest as the music sounded, the group suffered from material misery.
The harvesting of dead wood was not alone in the search for self.
The newly released CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert in Griessem in front of a record-breaking audience of nearly 50 heads, as someone thinks they remember.
Rother at that time issued the wish to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
It was an immoral requirement for Roedelius and Moebius.
The group announced their separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and assured his existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzen" (hearts on fire).
Cluster revived in the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmonia has ever been.
We owe Griessem's Live album to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His label Grönland set out to maintain Krautrock as a German contribution to contemporary music.
Neu! had already been unearthed on this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is there, the British, former punk and author of the paperback book "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the inventor of the Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire fluctuation margin of Krautrock's influence would be defined with respect to future pop music.
The place left empty by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno’s phrase hovers in the room amidst singular sounds: “The only real music, you listen to the future.”
There are photos that show the producers with Harmonia in the room of the farm.
The projections of other black and white photos of wired tools in the bazaar serve to form the legend.
In front of them, the three veterans are once again busy improvising.
But more by sticking microphones to the organ and the drums, to pull to the instruments of sounds unheard thanks to the instruments with effects built itself.
Today, electronic music resembles electronic music.
All three of them are great technical nerds.
Even the choir of the house will not change that.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we cough and whisper under the cloud of sounds, and we sing at a nice moment "Aaaaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never about rock.
Roots have been less sought after in the blues than in music conservatories (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk) or in the escape from artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
The one who shouts "68" is not totally wrong, and Harmonia too is now no longer irritated by this from now on.
But what goes the most will be meticulously covered on stage.
Where does the music begin and where does it end?
This can hit someone's nerves (?) or grant fleeting moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Mortal Peace", two films once again address the Balkan War.
But the two do not convince.
Either the projects rely too much on action and the exchange of senseless shots or on the contrary they are too tearful.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news is that war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, but it is precisely there, in the darkest hinterland of the Bosnian war, that actor Richard Gere is then found.
We had ultimately lost sight of the most handsome man of the eighties, because far too many cute and futile roles in women’s sentimental films and far too many Buddhist-themed press conferences delighted him in the urge to show himself.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument for watching "The Hunting Party" anyway - when the hunter becomes the hunted (why should today's films be as long and confusing as collective agreements of locomotive drivers?)
He delivers a magnificent representation full of winks: deep down, his character of war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if fate and the film industry were not so benevolent: a man who has his best moments for a long time behind him, but who, even as a ruined monument to his decline, has nevertheless kept visible remains of his former charm.
But despite this asset, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Mortal Peace", which also comes out this week, the endless succession of failed films on the Balkan war.
The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who rescue a Serbian woman from the Kosovar free-gunners, in whom one of them still falls in love.
Although it is welcome that here the Serbs are not for once presented as the only causes of all ills, this film as flat as a TV movie is lost far too quickly in the action and the exchanges of senseless shots.
This remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway but with a war instead.
On the contrary, we can examine in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why deep down there has never been a real good film about the Balkan war.
The story of the three American war reporters, who condition themselves to track down the high war criminal "the fox", could perhaps have become, along with another director and another screenwriter (both Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories are strikingly similar: two males go in small teams in the forest, to accomplish something the military can’t do and for the two males, it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that we simply don't let Simon Hunt be the heartless deserted cynic, as he is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also attribute him a romantic affair with a Bosnian murdered later.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitely bad, when the reporter, in the space of the last five minutes, by an accelerated process, achieves what NATO, the CIA and all the bounty hunters in the world have not succeeded in five years: catch the war criminal and leave him for a just revenge to the Bosnian Muslims.
This is so bad that we should go to the Hague International Court for Crime Against Film Logic.
In this case, the film has too deep a human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still free, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they must exceptionally agree) of not conducting the hunt sufficiently intensively due to secret political agreements.
But the well-intentioned and the bad are so similar this time that a famous poem by Brecht comes to mind.
He speaks of a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet’s work table: “Compassionate, I see the veins of the forehead swollen, clearly: how tiresome it is to be wicked.”
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tumescent heads, but they hint at how tiring it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of films about the Balkan war.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood films about Iraq were big flops.
It can be added: there have never been any good films about South Africa.
Which is worth it every time: when a star hangs out on a crisis fire or a minefield, something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits going Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio comes out.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still simply too close in time.
Anyway, decades have always passed before Hollywood could make a good Holocaust movie with "Schindler's List."
Some films have yet to mature - those worth today of classic works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have by no means been unanimously celebrated in their time as masterpieces.
But maybe we also know too much today about the conflicts of the world, where each hecatomb comes live on two screens at the same time at home,
And writers are delighted by the lack of scruples they need to tell beautiful stories.
“To be or not to be” or “The Dictator” actually became as good also because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not yet know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you don't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps it is necessary to have the sarcastic and distant artistic gaze of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Dictionnaire de Lempri<0xC3><0xA8>re" and the Balkan war, he replied: "It's only because some things never change."
“The big cities will always be horribly dangerous, men will always be murdered in horrific ways, and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.”
Von Beust was criticized for canceling the Olympics.
The mayor's backlash from Hamburg's bid for the Summer Olympics has clashed in politics and the economy with virulent criticism.
Many want to keep fighting for the Water Games.
But von Beust calls for realism in the appraisal of chances.
Hamburg Chamber of Commerce chief Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz on Wednesday described an abandonment as "bad for the local economy".
In recent times, no other project has deployed as many motivational forces in the city as the idea of the Olympics.
"Without this goal, the political-sports momentum could not have been maintained in the same measures."
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to bury the draft, but to find a new starting point in the longer term, "which takes as a starting point another modified agenda".
Mayor Ole von Beust said on Wednesday that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions were unrealistic until at least 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on a bid for the Olympics, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," Von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He refers to the expected decision of the Sports Federation at the beginning of December, regarding Munich's candidacy for the 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means for us that, in the timeframe we have planned until 2028, we will have no chance.”
However, the dream does not belong definitively to the past, said Von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust’s statements.
From this the impression would be given that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympics in the next 25 years.
“It’s too early to close an opportunity, burying the plans already now,” HSB President Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
An abandonment of the candidacy would also be in contradiction with the statements of the head of the Senate on the occasion of the reception in plenary assembly of the German Federation of Higher Schools of Sport.
There, Von Beust allegedly described Hamburg's bid for the 2015 Universiade as "not a substitute" for the Hamburg Olympics.
The Federation of Higher Schools of Sport had first in the past weeks named Hamburg as the candidate city.
The SPD faction of the mayor has accused the Senate of not having used this precious time in building housing in Hamburg.
“The development of the Little Grasbrook was refused by the Senate for years because it played the Olympics card and excluded housing construction,” said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always called for the Little Grasbrook to have an integrated plan in the Olympics and a subsequent use of housing, the CDU would have relied exclusively on the "Event factor".
The candidacy for the 2012 Summer Olympics would have raised great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, had broken up against Leipzig.
These aren't Warhols' crates.
The one who connects the concepts Sweden and wooden case, thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
At the moment, wooden crates made in Sweden cast shadows on Warhol’s list of works.
A large part of the ninety Brillo-Boxes of "Type Stockholm" listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned a few months ago the authenticity of the Brillo-Boxes of the year 1968 by Andy Warhol, the internal researches of the Moderna Museet of Stockholm today lead to a disenchanting result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", of which the former director of the Pontus Hulten Museum gave a gift in 1995 to the International Brillo-Boxes of the year 1968 by Andy Warhol.
The ancient history is entangled, a disconcerting chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created in New York his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted wooden crates, which are based on the red-blue-white design of the "Brillo" powder soap cartons.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet in 1968 presented - with Warhol's agreement - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: these did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but had been delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but rather their models, exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to produce some Brillo wooden crates in Sweden, which were not exhibited at the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time today speak of about fifteen wooden crates that at the time would have entered the history of art and auctions, as Brillo-Boxes original authorized by Andy Warhol, under the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them reached more than $100,000 in auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum erroneously claimed later that about one hundred wooden crates had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol would later cede to him.
In truth, Hultén’s 105 cases were produced in Malmö only in 1990, for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By that time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief curator of the Moderna Museet, examined, alongside the six Brillo-Boxes of the museum, three other Swedish private collections, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their laminate panels were first printed and sanded, then applied with a brush of white oil paint.
On the contrary, the texture of the copies dating back to 1990 reveals that the paint was applied directly without a background layer on the laminated panels, using a paint roller - moreover it is not an oil paint, but an acrylic.
"These crates have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes," hints the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York doesn't come up with another decision, the Moderna Museet will classify the six crates in its collection."
Already in July, the Authentication Board announced that it would investigate the "heavy charges" that will be raised in the case of powdered soap boxes.
But since then there has been an inexorable silence.
The rebel soldiers of Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers abandon, the same ones who had entrenched themselves in a hotel in Manila, and who had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who accused the President of corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters at the hotel that he could not answer for any bloodshed.
The loyal soldiers in power had shortly before stormed the hotel using tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been holed up in the building for hours.
About half of them were standing before the courts on Wednesday because of a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He took advantage of the audience to suddenly overshadow himself with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police, who normally had to monitor them, had apparently deserted in his favor and joined his mutiny.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the removal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Troops loyal to power closed the area around the respectable hotel.
The Chair convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the soldiers' actions.
“People have had enough of it,” Trillanes said.
“We call on people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, who was in command of the Scout Rangers' elite unit, said other army units would soon join the march.
Critics of the regime had called for a major demonstration against the president on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded for months by accusations of corruption.
The financial district of Manila was already the scene of the attempted mutiny of about 200 members of the army against Arroyo since 2003.
The insurgency broke up almost 24 hours after the army refused to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a main shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet has secured a stake of more than 20 percent in telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as the company communicated on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 percent of the share capital would be held.
We had previously speculated on a buyout.
The option would remain open to further increase participation in Versatel.
With this step we seek to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet has communicated.
Just before, assumptions had already been made on Wednesday about an entry, after Berenberg bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator from 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The credit institution would hold the money only for a third party, it is said in the market.
The day before, United Internet had already acquired a nearly 10 percent stake in mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch listed 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros.
United Internet bought 5.15 million for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, the companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the commercialization of DSL and mobile telephony products.
"We are strengthening our partnership," a United Internet spokesman said.
The two companies founded the joint venture MSP in order to take over competitor Freenet.
At the moment, the two companies want to be satisfied with their ten percent stake in Freenet, and not make use of their right to endorse an additional 18.49 percent at Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
The two companies would, however, leave all options open, particularly to increase participation in the Freenet SA, it was learned.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-October.
Poker still difficult to predict on Freenet, which has been going on for months, is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
Freenet had at the end of the third quarter 2.9 million customers bound by a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million DSL and full subscription customers.
United Internet Holding and Drillisch had a direct stake in Freenet of 6.01 percent so far.
It was now agreed that Drillisch would bring about four percent more.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas had already been decided in August.
